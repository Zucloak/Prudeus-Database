AREJOLA, COMPLAINANT,\nVS. JUDGE JOSE S. PEÃAS, JR., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nTERESITA O. ZAMUDIO, COMPLAINANT,\nVS. JUDGE JOSE S. PEÃAS, JR., RESPONDENT.\n\n[A.M. NO. RTJ-98-1398.Â  FEBRUARY 24, 1998]\n\nBENJAMIN R. AREJOLA, COMPLAINANT,\nVS. JUDGE JOSE S. PEÃAS, JR., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nREGALADO, J.:\n\nThese two\nadministrative matters concern former Judge Jose S. PeÃ±as, Jr. of the Regional Trial\nCourt of Iriga City, Branch 34. Although respondent retired from the service on December 10, 1996, the\ncharges were instituted when he was still the presiding judge of said court. [1]\n\nOn August 9,\n1994, Teresita O. Zamudio filed a complaint in the Office of the Ombudsman\nalleging that respondent is guilty of neglecting to support her two\nillegitimate daughters whom he sired several years before he was appointed to\nthe judiciary. [2] The complaint was referred to the\nOffice of the Court Administrator where it was docketed as Administrative\nMatter No. RTJ-95-1332, and which this Court later assigned to Associate\nJustice Eubolo G. Verzola of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report and\nrecommendation. [3]\n\nOn July 31,\n1995, the Court received a complaint from one Benjamin R. Arejola, a party in a\ncivil case then pending before respondent. [4] Arejola charged respondent with\ndereliction of judicial duty, grave misconduct, oppression, and conduct\nunbecoming a judge. The case was\naccepted for informal preliminary investigation and initially identified as\nAdministrative Matter No. OCA IPI-95-74-RTJ. The corresponding action in the two aforesaid cases then proceeded\nseparately. After all the proceedings\ninvolved had been completed and the requisite reports with recommendations were\nduly submitted, with the second administrative matter having been given its\npresent docket number, both cases were consolidated for judgment by the Court.\n\nThe\ncircumstances which eventuated in A.M. No. RTJ-95-1332 date back to the year 1968\nwhen Zamudio, then a naive fifteen year-old, met respondent who was in his\nforties, a practicing lawyer and a married man. Respondent was the counsel of Zamudioâs mother in a criminal case\nthat was ultimately dismissed. Upon her\nmotherâs pleas, respondent extended financial support to Zamudio for several\nyears thereafter, enabling her to pursue her schooling.\n\nAn illicit\naffair developed between Zamudio and respondent resulting in the birth of two\ndaughters, namely, Regina who was born on August 30, 1972, and Cherry who was\nborn on August 14, 1979. Although the\ncouple did not live together, respondent kept Zamudio as his mistress and\nhabitually gave to her financial support for his daughters, paying for their\nlodging and school expenses.\n\nOn February 5, 1987,\nrespondent was appointed to the judiciary. [5] His relationship with Zamudio had\nfizzled out by then although he continued to support his daughters. Later, however, he altogether stopped\nsending money for their support, thereby prompting Zamudio to initiate the\ninstant administrative case to obtain relief for their sustenance and other\nnecessities.\n\nOn June 26,\n1996, Zamudio filed a motion in the Court of Appeals to withdraw the case which\nwas still pending there. [6] The parties had allegedly arrived\nat a compromise agreement based on a financial settlement. [7] On August 8, 1996, however,\ncomplainant withdrew her said motion of desistance because respondent failed to\ncomply with his undertakings in that compromise agreement. [8]\n\nIn his answer\nthereafter filed in the same appellate court on August 26, 1996, respondent\nneither admitted nor denied any sexual relation with Zamudio and the allegation\nthat he fathered her daughters. [9] He did admit, however, that he\nreally entered into a compromise agreement with Zamudio which is why she\nwithdrew the case, but he later realized that he could not afford to pay the\namounts agreed upon, thus causing Zamudio to proceed with the same.\n\nNevertheless,\nrespondent made it clear that he did not mean to deprive Regina and Cherry Zamudio\nof participation in his retirement benefits. He asserted that he intended to have them avail themselves of their\nshares thereof after âassessing his needs principally for his own livelihood,\nsufficient to prevent him from becoming a pauper.â [10]\n\nUpon termination\nof the investigation and hearings, a report was submitted by the investigating\nJustice to this Court, and the case was referred to the Office of the Court\nAdministrator for recommendation.\n\nMeanwhile, A.M.\nNo. RTJ-98-1398 was raffled to and handled by the Second Division of this\nCourt. This administrative matter\nstemmed from Civil Case No. 270, an original action for mandamus instituted by\nArejola as one of the petitioners in Branch 34 of the Regional Trial Court of\nIriga City of which respondent was the presiding judge. [11] The case concerned a dispute over\nthe closure of a public road ordered by the then city mayor and city market\nsuperintendent who were sued as the respondents therein.\n\nApparently, said\nrespondents ordered the closure of Camposano Road, a public thoroughfare in San\nFrancisco, Iriga City, so that it could be used as an extension of the city\nmarket. Petitioners therein filed a\npetition for mandamus with damages and injunction, praying for a writ of\npreliminary mandatory injunction and temporary restraining order (TRO) in\nopposition to the closure. Arejola, by\nreason of his being a co-petitioner in that case, initiated the instant\nadministrative matter against herein respondent.\n\nArejola alleges\nthat respondent exhibited partiality in favor of the respondent officials in\nthat special civil action, as shown by the fact that respondent allegedly\nproceeded with the case without calling the court to order; conducted a hearing\nfor twenty minutes without a court stenographer to record the proceedings;\ninsisted that petitioners file an opposition to respondentsâ motion to dismiss;\ndisregarded the omnibus motion filed by petitioners; acted as judge and counsel\nfor respondents; and remarked that âupon the take-over of the new\nadministration, who is now your respondents (sic)â and â walang personalan\nito ,â or words to that effect.\n\nRespondent\nallegedly further gave political color to the petition; allowed the TRO to\nlapse without being implemented; insisted on the hearing of the injunction\naspect in the first week of June, over therein petitionersâ objection and after\nthe lapse of the twenty-day period of the TRO; showed an attitude of being\nbeholden to therein respondents; and allowed the appearance and admitted the\narguments of the respondent city mayor who is neither a lawyer nor was\nrepresented by one. [12]\n\nArejola had\nearlier moved for the inhibition of respondent as the presiding judge in that\ncase, but to no avail.\n\nIn a resolution\ndated November 15, 1995, this Court ordered respondent to comment on the\ncomplaint, [13] but he failed to do so. Thus, on March 20, 1996, the Court required\nrespondent to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held\nin contempt for failing to comply with the previous order to file his comment. [14] Respondent defied the order and the\ncase was referred to the Office of the Court Administrator for investigation,\nreport and recommendation.\n\nUp to this date,\nor over two years after being ordered by this Court to file his comment in A.M.\nNo. RTJ-98-1398, respondent has neither filed such comment nor submitted any\nexplanation for his non-compliance with the order.\n\nThe Office of\nthe Court Administrator duly submitted its recommendations to the Court for\nboth A.M. Nos. RTJ-95-1332 and RTJ-98-1398. Being well presented and logically arrived at, the Court approves the\nsame but with some modifications.\n\nIn A.M. No.\nRTJ-95-1332, it is undisputed that Regina and Cherry Zamudio are the\nillegitimate children of respondent and that the latter begot them under\nscandalous circumstances. Their mother,\nTeresita O. Zamudio, was a minor when respondent commenced his immoral liaison\nwith her. He maintained their\nextramarital affair for many years, abhorrently robbing Teresita of her youth\nand taking advantage of her vulnerability. Ironically, her then hapless situation obviously merited and required\nthe protection of a guardian which should have been respondentâs mode of\nconduct and attitude towards her.\n\nWe agree with\nthe investigating magistrate, Justice Verzola, that the instant case highlights\na weakness in the process of selection and appointment to the judiciary at the\ntime respondent was appointed, and that had the recommending authority or the\nappointing power been aware of respondentâs character flaws, it was unlikely\nthat he would have been appointed as a judge.\n\nDuring the\npendency of this case, respondent reached the compulsory age of retirement from\nthe government service. Consequently,\nthe penalty of either suspension from the service or dismissal therefrom can no\nlonger be imposed on him, and the complaint against him as a judge should be dismissed.\n\nAlso, the fact\nthat his dishonorable conduct occurred several years before his appointment to\nthe judiciary may be appreciated as a mitigation of his failing to fully\nachieve the moral standards required of a judge. His retirement from the judiciary and entitlement to the\ncorresponding benefits and other privileges earned by virtue of his service may\naccordingly be considered and duly effected.\n\nNevertheless,\nthe dismissal of the complaint against him as a judge does not absolve\nrespondent from his legal responsibility to recognize and support his\nillegitimate children, Regina and Cherry Zamudio. Furthermore, as correctly submitted by the Office of the Court\nAdministrator - - x\nx x Even as an ordinary lawyer, respondent has to conform to the strict\nstandard of conduct demanded of members of the profession. Certainly, fathering (children) by a woman\nother than his lawful wife fails to meet these standards x x x. [15]\n\nThe jurisdiction\nof the Court over this case was, therefore, not lost when respondent retired\nfrom the judiciary [16] and, in the exercise of its power\nover respondent as a member of the bar, the Court may require him to comply\nwith his obligation to support his illegitimate daughters.\n\nIt appears,\nhowever, that Regina is already 25 years old, a college graduate, married and\nwith a child. Cherry, on the other\nhand, is 18 years old, single, and is still a student. Based only on the facts appearing on record,\nRegina is no longer entitled to receive present and future support from\nrespondent, as the duty therefor primarily devolves upon her husband, unless it\nshall be proven in the proper proceedings that recourse may be had against the\nother persons provided by law to be successively liable to support her. [17]\n\nCherry, on her\npart, is entitled to receive support from respondent for the period, purposes\nand in the amount provided by law. [18] Under the factual ambience of this\ncase, a monthly support of P 5,000.00 would be reasonable and should be\npaid to her by respondent upon the finality of the judgment herein. Both Regina and Cherry Zamudio may also seek\nthe payment of support in arrears but in the appropriate proceedings and in the\nproper forum.\n\nWith respect to\nA.M. No. RTJ-98-1398, we likewise adopt the conclusion of the Office of the\nCourt Administrator on the charges of bias and partiality filed against\nrespondent, to wit: Ordinarily, the failure of\nrespondent to comment means a tacit admission of the charges leveled against\nhim. In this case, however, the\nallegation of bias and partiality are not substantiated by evidence. Bias and partiality cannot be presumed from\nthe circumstances enumerated by the complainant. Apart from these bare allegations, there must be convincing proof\nto show that respondent judge is indeed bias(ed) and partial. In administrative proceedings, the burden of\nproof that respondent committed the act complained of rests on the complainant. Failing in this, the complaint must be\ndismissed. However, we found respondent\njudgeâs failure to comment on the charges as constituting gross\ninsubordination. x x x The\nnon-compliance of respondent with the several directives of this Court is a\nclear manifestation of his continued defiance and disrespect to a lawful order\nof a superior court x x x . [19]\n\nMere suspicion\nthat a judge was partial to a party is not enough as there should be adequate\nevidence to prove the charge. [20] This Court finds that there is insufficient\nevidence to hold respondent liable for the charges and we are thus constrained\nto dismiss the complaint filed by Arejola.\n\nThere was no\nshowing that respondent had an interest, personal or otherwise, in the\nprosecution of the case before him. The\nbare allegations of complainant cannot overturn the presumption that respondent\nacted regularly and with impartiality. [21]\n\nWithal, the\ndismissal of the complaint does not prevent the Court from penalizing\nrespondent for his contumacious conduct in repeatedly disobeying the orders for\nthe filing of a comment. His failure to\nfile the same and explain his omission, despite several opportunities for him\nto do so, is reprehensible and tantamount to gross misconduct and insubordination. [22]\n\nA judge should\nuphold the integrity of the judiciary [23] and respondent cannot expect others\nto respect the law when he himself cannot obey simple orders such as that\ndirecting him to file a comment, as well as the explanation required by\nshow-cause resolution. [24] The Court will not tolerate\nrecalcitrance by a party to a case, more so where he is a member of the\njudiciary and is expected to be the embodiment of adherence to the law and the\ninstitution to which he belongs.\n\nWHEREFORE , judgment is hereby rendered as\nfollows: 1. In A.M. No. RTJ-95-1332, the\ncomplaint against respondent as a judge is hereby DISMISSED. Respondent is, however, ORDERED to fulfill\nand settle his legal obligation of support in favor of his two illegitimate\ndaughters, Regina and Cherry Zamudio. The corresponding finance authorities of the Office of the Court\nAdministrator shall deduct the amount of Five Thousand Pesos ( P 5,000.00)\nevery month from respondentâs monthly pension and pay the same to Cherry\nZamudio as and for present and future support until the obligation is\nextinguished in accordance with law. This is understood to be without prejudice to such remedies as Regina\nand Cherry Zamudio may avail themselves of for the recovery of support in\narrears and the enforcement of such other rights provided by the law on support\nas hereinbefore discussed. 2. The complaint against respondent\nin A.M. No. RTJ-98-1398 is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. However, respondent is declared guilty of\nserious misconduct and insubordination for his failure to comply with the\nlawful orders of this Court. He is\nhereby ORDERED to pay a FINE of Five Thousand Pesos ( P 5,000.00),\nlikewise to be deducted from his retirement benefits, with a stern warning that\na repetition of the same or any similar conduct, as a member of the bar, will\nbe dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.
