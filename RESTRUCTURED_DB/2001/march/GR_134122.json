CRIM. CASE NO. U-9560\n\n\"Lizabeth Guntang is a fifteen year old girl who lived with her siblings and their parents, Alejandro and Rosita Guntang at Casantaan, Urdaneta, Pangasinan (TSN, June 10, 1998, pp. 2, 4-5). On November 24, 1997 at about 11:00 o'clock in the morning, Lizabeth was inside the room of their nipa hut taking care of her brother Adriano when she was called by her father, Alejandro (Ibid., 7-8). She left her brother on the hammock inside the bedroom and descended the two steps to where her father was (Ibid., 8-9).\n\n\"Upon reaching her father, she was ordered to lie on the 'papag' which he used as a bed. When Lizabeth asked why she was being ordered to lie down, Alejandro merely reiterated his order. Lizabeth obeyed and laid down on the 'papag' (Ibid., p. 10). With a bolo in hand, Alejandro laid beside Lizabeth and forcibly removed her blouse. Lizabeth objected but Alejandro persisted. He removed her bra and held her breast and nipple (Ibid., pp. 10-11). Alejandro then removed Lizabeth's shorts and panty. Again, Lizabeth voiced her objections to no avail. Thereafter, Alejandro positioned himself on top of Lizabeth, held her two hands and forced his penis inside her vagina. This caused Lizabeth pain. Without taking heed of his daughter's pain, Alejandro began a push and pull movement. After some time, Lizabeth's brother began to cry. Lizabeth pushed at her father pleading with him to stop but he refused. Alejandro only stopped when he had satisfied his lust (Ibid., pp. 12-17). After the deed was done, Alejandro warned Lizabeth not to tell anybody what happened between them (Ibid., p. 17).\n\n\"II. CRIM. CASE NO. U-9561\n\n\"At around 11:00 o'clock that evening (November 24, 1997), Lizabeth was already sleeping in their room with her mother and brothers and sisters when she was awakened by the call of her father (TSN, June 15, 1998, p. 3). She stood up and went down to her father. She found him drinking liquor, which he offered to her. She refused but was, nevertheless, forced to drink. She was then ordered to go to his bed. She complied because she was frightened when she saw her father holding a bolo. She sat down on the 'papag' which was being used by her father as his bed (Ibid., p. 4-5). Alejandro drank his liquor and then approached Lizabeth. After being forced to lie down on the bed. Alejandro began to touch her face and breast (Ibid., p. 5; June 16, 1998, p. 3). Lizabeth protested and told Alejandro that she did not like what he was doing. In turn, Alejandro threatened to punch her with his fist. He undressed her, touched her body and sucked her breast (June 16, 1998, pp. 3-4). Thereafter, he removed his shorts and brief, held her two hands, positioned himself on top of Lizabeth and forced his penis into her vagina. When Alejandro ejaculated he got off Lizabeth (Ibid., pp. 5-6). She then put on her clothes (Ibid., p. 7). Alejandro did the same and threatened to kill Lizabeth, her mother and her siblings if she told anyone of what transpired between them (Ibid., pp. 7-8). Lizabeth then went back to lie to the room to lie down. She was, however, not able to go back to sleep (Ibid., pp. 8-9).\n\n\"III. CRIM. CASE NO. U-9562\n\n\"On December 24, 1997 at about 12:00 o'clock midnight, Alejandro laid down beside Lizabeth who was sleeping with her brothers and sisters. While holding a bolo, he woke her up and warned her not to shout. Knowing what was about to happen, Lizabeth protested (TSN, June 23, 1998, p. 4-5). Alejandro took no heed of the protest and undressed Lizabeth. He took hold of her hand and inserted his penis into her vagina (Ibid., p. 5). He began to make a push and pull movement. After a while he stopped and got off Lizabeth only to get on top of her again and force himself on Lizabeth (Ibid., p. 6). Lizabeth felt her father discharge his semen. He then returned to his bed. Lizabeth changed her clothes and began to cry. Her father warned her to stop crying or else he would box her (Ibid., pp. 7-9). She eventually went to sleep (Ibid., p. 9).\n\n\"IV . CRIM. CASE NO. U-9563\n\n\"At about 11:00 o'clock in the evening sometime in the month of January 1998, Lizabeth was studying inside the room where she slept with her mother and brothers and sisters (TSN, July 2, 1998, p. 3). Alejandro called her to come down. When she obeyed, she was brought to her father's bed. She was pushed to lie down on the bed together with Alejandro. Alejandro removed her clothes and kissed and touched her body (Ibid., pp. 4-5). When Lizabeth pushed her father away, he boxed her. Alejandro then removed his clothes, went on top of Lizabeth and inserted his penis inside her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. When he was done, Alejandro took hold of her dress and told her to stay. After dressing up, Lizabeth asked permission to go back to the room where she slept (Ibid., pp. 6-8).\n\n\"V. CRIM. CASE NO. U-9564\n\n\"On February 14, 1998, at about 11:00 o'clock in the evening, Lizabeth was sleeping in their room with her mother and brothers and sisters. She was awakened by the call of her father. When she answered, she was ordered to go down and give him a massage. Alejandro threatened to hurt her if she did not obey. Lizabeth went down and approached her father and saw a bolo beside him (TSN, July 6, 1998, pp. 3-5). When she asked why she was being called, Alejandro pulled her and made her lie down beside him. He told her not to make a sound and then undressed her. He kissed her body and placed himself on top of her (Ibid., pp. 5-7). Alejandro lowered his briefs up to his thighs then forced his penis inside her vagina. He again had sexual intercourse with her. When Alejandro had finished, Lizabeth dressed up and asked permission to urinate outside the hut (Ibid., pp. 8-9).\n\n\"When she got out, Lizabeth hid by the bamboo grove until she was sure that her father did not follow her. She then went to her grandmother, Felicitas Domingo, to whom she narrated what her father had done to her. (Ibid., pp. 9-10) The next morning, they sought the help of a Kagawad of the barangay who accompanied them to the police station where they reported the crime committed against Lizabeth (TSN, July 20, 1998, pp. 3-4).\n\n\"The medical examination conducted on Lizabeth by Dr. Noel Obedoza revealed a raptured hymen with lacerations at 1, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock positions (TSN, May 21, 1998, pp. 2, 5).\" [4] Alejandro Guntang reiterates before this Court his claim of innocence of the charges and his defense of alibi. His story -\n\"x x x (O)n November 24, 1997, the accused Alejandro Guntang left their house at 6:30 a.m. and went to the rice field (TSN, August 3, 1998, p. 3). He returned around 1:10 in the afternoon. He ate and rested for awhile, and then went back to the rice field. At around 5:30 in the afternoon, he returned home. On the other hand, the victim arrived home at 6:00 p.m. The accused asked why she arrived late and Lizabeth answered in a loud voice, which he resented and he whipped her (TSN, August 3, 1998, p. 6). They ate supper at around 7:30 p.m. after which they went to sleep. Nothing unusual happened that night.\n\n\"On December 24, 1997, the accused was at home from 7:00 o'clock in the morning to 12:00 o'clock noon (TSN, August 4, 1998, p. 8). At 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon he went to the ricefield and stayed there up to 4:30 in the afternoon, after which, he went home. At around 11:00 o'clock in the evening the entire family was already sleeping and nothing unusual happened that night (TSN, August 4, 1998, p. 3).\n\n\"During the month of January 1998, there was no untoward incident that happened and the relationship between the family members was cordial and peaceful (TSN, August 4, 1998, p. 4).\n\n\"In the morning of February 14, 1997, the accused was at home and in the afternoon he went to the ricefield to visit his plants and stayed there up to 5:30 in the afternoon.\n\n\"In the afternoon at around 6:00, he requested the victim to cook their food and she answered: 'I am not your servant why are you ordering me to cook food' (TSN, August 4, 1998, p. 6). He resented the way she answered him and whipped her buttock. He admonished her that if she does not want to be advised, she better leave their house.\n\n\"The victim went upstairs to prepare their bedding at around 10:30 in the evening. His wife woke up to feed their baby and she found that the victim was not in bed. He instructed his wife to look for the victim at his mother-in-law's house. She went to the said house and found the victim talking with his mother-in-law (TSN, August 4, 1998, p. 8). From that time, the victim never returned home.\" [5] Rosita, the accused's wife and the mother of the complainant, corroborated the testimony of her husband. According to her, she was at home on the various dates when the rapes were supposedly committed and she did not notice any unusual event in their household. She maintained that their family life was harmonious and that her husband was a good man and incapable of the crimes imputed to him.\n\nThe court a quo, not convinced by the defense urgings, convicted Guntang in its decision of 14 August 1998; it thereby adjudged:\n\"WHEREFORE, the Court finds ALEJANDRO GUNTANG guilty beyond reasonable doubt of INCESTUOUS RAPE aggravated by relationship where the victim is below 18 years old under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Republic Act 7659 and the Court sentences ALEJANDRO GUNTANG, as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"1. | In CRIM.

Most unfortunately for accused-appellant, a painstaking study of the records has revealed no serious flaw in the testimony of the complainant nor in the conclusions reached by the trial court.\n\nRecited in full, hereunder, is the testimony plainly given by Lizabeth at the witness stand.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"FISCAL MENESES:\n | \n | [O]n said date, November 24, 1997 in the morning at approximately 11:00 o'clock A.M., where were you at that time, Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | I was in the second floor of our house sir.\n | \n\"Q | What were you doing then?\n | \n\"A | I was taking care of my little brother, sir.\n | \n\"COURT:\n | \n | What is the occupation of your father?\n | \n\"A | He is a farmer, sir.\n | \n\"Q | About your mother?\n | \n\"A | She is a mango fruit picker, sir.\n | \n\"COURT: Go ahead.\n | \n\"FISCAL MENESES:\n | \n\"Q | Was there an unusual incident or event that took place on you on said date and time?\n | \n\"A | There was, sir.\n | \n\"Q | What was that incident all about, Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | My father raped me, sir.\n | \n\"Q | How did this happen?\n | \n\"A | While I was taking care of my younger brother, he called on me, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Who is this younger brother that you were taking care of that time?\n | \n\"A | Adriano, sir.\n | \n\"Q | After calling you, what happened next?\n | \n\"A | He called me and he put his organ to my organ, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Where was your father when he called you?\n | \n\"A | Downstairs, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Are you trying to say to us that your house consists of first and second floors?\n | \nA | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"COURT:\n | \n | While attending to your brother Adriano, you said your father called you, is that correct?\n | \n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Where was your father when he called you?\n | \n\"A | He was downstairs, sir.\n | \n\"Q | How did he call you?\n | \n\"A | He said, 'Beth, come here.'\n | \n\"Q | Did you follow his order?\n | \n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Did you go to the first floor?\n | \n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"Q | With your little brother, Adriano?\n | \n\"A | No, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Where did you leave Adriano?\n | \n\"A | In the hammock, sir.\n | \n\"Q | When you went downstairs, what else happened?\n | \n\"A | He ordered me to go to his bed, sir.\n | \n\"Q | His bed, is it in a room?\n | \n\"A | It is not a room, sir.\n | \n\"Q | When he ordered you to go to his bed, did you comply?\n | \n\"A | I asked, 'Why, father?'

urinate at that time?\n\n\"A No sir, I did not go to urinate but instead I ran to the house of my grandmother, sir,\" [12] The Court is not persuaded by the defense claim that the series of rape incidents could not have happened without the other members of the family being made aware of it. A small living quarter has not been considered to be a safe refuge from a sexual assault. Copulation is known to occur despite the presence of other persons around. [13] The Court has once observed: \"Considering the cramped space and meager room for privacy, couples perhaps have gotten used to quick and less disturbing modes of sexual congresses which elude the attention of family members; otherwise, under the circumstances, it would be almost impossible to copulate with them around even when asleep. It is also not impossible nor incredible for the family members to be in deep slumber and not be awakened while the sexual assault is being committed.\" [14] Still, in another case, [15] the accused tried to impugn the complainant's accusation of rape against him by pointing out the \"environmental circumstances\" involved, i.e., the two of them in the sala of the house with no less than eight people. This Court once again ruled against the argument and explained: \"The crime of rape x x x has been known to be possible of commission even when the rapist and victim are not alone considering that, given the concomitant anxiety, the act can take only a short time to consummate. x x x A conviction for rape could still be proper despite the fact that it is alleged to have been perpetrated in the same room with the rapist's spouse or where other family members also sleep. x x x Lust, it has been said before, is apparently no respecter of time and place.\" The Court here reiterates those observations.\n\nGuntang would contend that Lizabeth and her maternal grandmother nurtured ill feelings against him, which could well be, he stressed, the real motive behind the rape charges. Lizabeth, he added, had resented his whipping her on November 1997 when she came home late and on 14 February 1998 when she answered back after having been told to cook for him. He claimed to have had a fight with his mother-in-law, when he called her a \"witch.\" The court a quo properly opined that the imputed motives were \"too shallow\" [16] to be believed. It would indeed be highly improbable for Lizabeth with no record of sexual perversity to fabricate a story against her own father which could very well imperil his liberty or life. [17] It would take depravity for a young girl to concoct a story that could put her own father on death row and drag herself and the rest of her family to a lifetime of shame. [18] In People vs. Lucas, [19] this Court said: Even assuming that there existed some resentment on the part of the victim against the accused, it would nevertheless be hard to believe that a naive lass could be so motivated by feelings of revenge as to concoct a story of rape, and subject herself to the indignity of a public trial against her own father, if there was no truth to it. Neither would Lizabeth's grandmother be so callous as to instigate her granddaughter to file five counts of rape against her father simply on account of alleged resentment for being called a witch.\n\nThe initial silence of Lizabeth could be attributed to her age, the moral ascendancy of the accused and his threats against her life. Lizabeth was barely 15 years old when she was first raped by the accused. Procrastination by the victim in rape cases had seldom been taken to be an indication of a fabricated charge. [20]\n\nGuntang tries to bolster his claim of innocence by raising the defense of alibi. The trial court has correctly rejected this defense. Against positiveevidence, alibi becomes most unsatisfactory. [21] For it to be credible, the accused must not only prove his presence at another place at the time of the commission of the offense but must also demonstrate that it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the locus criminis at that time. [22] The evidence is bereft of any such indication.\n\nUnder Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, [23] as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act 7659, simple rape is punishable by reclusion perpetua. Where, however, the offended party is under eighteen years of age and the offender is a parent of the victim, both qualifying circumstances being here aptly alleged in the informations, the penalty is increased to one degree higher, i.e., to the penalty of death.\n\nThe informations uniformly alleged that Lizabeth was 15 years old when raped, a matter likewise explicitly stated in her testimony and supported by her birth certificate -\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q | Please state your name, age and other personal circumstances?\n | \n\"A | Lizabeth Guntang, 15 years old, single, student, resident of Casantaan, Urdaneta, Pangasinan.\n | \n\"xxx xxx xxx\n | \n\"FISCAL MENESES:\n | \n | How about your parents, what are their names?\n | \n\"A | Alejandro Guntang and Rosita Guntang, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Are they legally married to your own knowledge, Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"COURT:\n | \n | You said you are 15 years old, do you have proof?\n | \n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"Q | What is your proof?\n | \n\"A | Birth Certificate, sir.\n | \n\"xxx xxx xxx\n | \n\"Q | On November 24, 1997 the date that your father raped you, how old were you at that time?\n | \n\"A | 14, sir.\"[24](complainant's birthdate is on November 26, 1982 based on her birth certificate)\n[END_TABLE]\n\n\"Q Please state your name, age and other personal circumstances?\n\n\"A Lizabeth Guntang, 15 years old, single, student, resident of Casantaan, Urdaneta, Pangasinan.\n\n\"xxx xxx xxx\n\n\"FISCAL MENESES:\n\nHow about your parents, what are their names?\n\n\"A Alejandro Guntang and Rosita Guntang, sir.\n\n\"Q Are they legally married to your own knowledge, Madam Witness?\n\n\"A\n\nYes, sir.\n\n\"COURT:\n\nYou said you are 15 years old, do you have proof?\n\n\"A Yes, sir.\n\n\"Q What is your proof?\n\n\"A Birth Certificate, sir.\n\n\"xxx xxx xxx\n\n\"Q On November 24, 1997 the date that your father raped you, how old were you at that time?\n\n\"A\n\n14, sir.\" [24] (complainant's birthdate is on November 26, 1982 based on her birth certificate) Guntang himself admitted at the witness stand to be the legitimate father of Lizabeth, a fact also attested to by his wife.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"ATTY.

The Supreme Court has ruled that if the crime of rape is committed or effectively qualified by any of the circumstances under which the death penalty is authorized by law, the indemnity for the victim shall be increased to P75,000.00. [28] In addition, as well as in consonance with prevailing jurisprudence, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages must also be granted to the complainant for each count of rape. The fact that the rape victim has suffered the trauma of mental, physical, and psychological sufferings is too obvious to still require recital thereof at the trial by the victim; the Court assumes and acknowledges such agony on her part. [29] The award of exemplary damages is in order.\n\nWHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta, Pangasinan, Branch 46, in Criminal Case Nos. 135234-38 finding accused-appellant ALEJANDRO GUNTANG Y GAPOS guilty beyond reasonable doubt of five counts of rape and imposing upon him the penalty of death for each count is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellant is also ordered to pay the complainant LIZABETH GUNTANG the sums of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P 50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages, for each count of rape.\n\nIn accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for the possible exercise of pardoning power.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr., and Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Judge Modesto C.
