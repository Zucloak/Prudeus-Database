  "title": "EDUARDO CUISON, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: The constitutional proscription of double jeopardy is not violated by a Court of Appeals order requiring the trial court to promulgate a decision sentencing the accused to imprisonment even if, earlier, the same decision has been promulgated in regard only to the payment of the modified civil indemnity arising from the same criminal act. Otherwise stated, the promulgation of only one part of the decision, i.e., the liability for civil indemnity, is not a bar to the subsequent promulgation of the other part, the imposition of the criminal accountability. The Case This is the gist of this Courtâs resolution of the petition for review on certiorari , assailing the November 5, 1996 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals[2] in CA-GR SP No. 41096. The dispositive portion of the said Decision, which set aside the April 12, 1996 Resolution[3] of the Regional Trial Court of Lingayen, Pangasinan, Branch 39,[4] reads as follows: âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Resolution dated April 12, 1996 of the respondent Judge is hereby SET ASIDE and he is ordered to set anew the promulgation of the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of conviction and sentencing the accused to serve imprisonment for the duration stated in the decision of the said respondent Court dated February 7, 1989. The order for the payment of the civil liabilities has been promulgated earlier. SO ORDERED.â[5] The RTC Resolution, set aside by the Court of Appeals, disposed: âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the âUrgent Motion to Set Aside Promulgationâ filed by the accused thru counsel, is meritorious and accordingly, the same is hereby granted.â The Facts The undisputed facts of this case, as narrated by the Court of Appeals, are reproduced below: âOn February 7, 1989, respondent Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan (Branch 39) rendered a Joint Decision in Criminal Cases Nos. L-3553 and L-3554, the dispositive portion of which is as follows: âWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Eduardo Cuison guilty of the crime of double homicide, beyond reasonable doubt and therefore sentences him to suffer imprisonment from 6 years and 1 day of [p]rision [m]ayor as [m]inimum to 12 years and 1 day of [r]eclusion [t]emporal as [m]aximum, for each offense, with the accessories provided by law and to pay the costs. Accused is also ordered to indemnify the heirs of Rafael Sapigao the amount of P30,000.00 and the heirs of Rulo Castro also the amount of P30,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.â On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the said decision was affirmed with the modification that the civil indemnity was increased to P50,000.00. The dispositive portion of said Decision of this Court dated July 30, 1991 reads: âPREMISES CONSIDERED, the joint decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by ordering accused Eduardo Cuison to indemnify the heirs of Rafael Sapigao the amount of P50,000.00 and the heirs of Rulo Castro also the amount of P50,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.â The accused elevated the decision on a petition for review docketed as G.R. Nos. 108985-86 but the Supreme Court denied the said petition on December 1, 1993. The case was remanded to the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan (Br. 39) for promulgation of the decision. However, respondent Judge promulgated [on April 4, 1995] the decision of [the Court of Appeals] only with respect to the modified civil liability of the accused but did not commit the accused to jail to commence service of his sentence. Asst. City Prosecutor Abraham L. Ramos II reported the matter to the Solicitor General and requested that a motion for clarification be filed with this Court to clarify the decision dated July 30, 1991. On July 7, 1995, the Solicitor General filed a Motion to Clarify Decision. On August 17, 1995, [the Court of Appeals] rendered a Resolution which states in pertinent portions thereof: âIn the dispositive portion of this Courtâs decision, We simply modified the appealed decision of the court a quo in one respect only - the increase of the indemnity to be paid by the appellant to the heirs of the victims from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00 as ruled in various cases including that cited in Our decision, People vs. Sison, 189 SCRA 643, 646. In view of the foregoing, it is ineluctable that the penalty imposed by the lower court was not touched on at all by this Court especially in the light of [o]ur [o]bservation in the said decision, as follows: âAfter a careful review of the evidence on records, this Court entertains no doubt as to the participation of the accused-appellant in the shooting of Sapigao and Rulo Castro. The court a quo has expressed the following findings in its decision, to which findings this Court accords the great weight and respect such findings of the trial court are entitled to: Conspiracy . . . was proven by the following circumstances: xxx xxx xxx The following circumstances showing the sequence of events, the mode or manner in which the offenses were perpetrated taken together indicated that the assailants cooperated and helped each other in the attainment of the same aim. (Memorandum, pp. 20-21) (CA Decision, pp. 14-16; Rollo, pp. 127-129)â Acting on the afore-cited motion to clarify decision, this Court hereby declares that this Court had affirmed the decision of the court a quo with regard to the penalty of imprisonment imposed in the said trial courtâs decision.â Respondent Judge then set the promulgation of the decision anew. The accused, however, filed a Motion to Set Aside Promulgation on the following grounds: â1. That the judgment in said case was already promulgated on 4 April 1995 and therefore there is nothing to promulgate anymore. 2. To pursue with [sic] the scheduled promulgation will violate the accusedâs constitutional right against jeopardy.â In a Resolution dated April 12, 1996, the respondent Judge granted the aforestated motion holding: âNow, the question is: May the resolution of the Honorable Court of Appeals promulgated on 17 August 1995 which âclarifiedâ the dispositive portion of its original decision, be considered as an amendment, alteration or modification of the decision? Here, we must not forget the basic rule that in the execution of the judgment, it is the dispositive portion of the decision which controls. We cannot also forget that, as already mentioned above, we have already promulgated the said decision by reading to the accused the dispositive portion, and that to the best of our knowledge, he had already complied therewith by paying the damages which were awarded. It may be relevant at this point in time, to cite the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of Heirs of George Bofill vs. Court of Appeals, 237 SCRA 393 that âHad the Court of Appeals been more accurate and precise in quoting data from the records, it would have arrived at the right conclusionâ The Honorable Court of Appeals cited the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of Partola-Jo vs. CA, 216 SCRA 692, that: âWhere there is an ambiguity caused by an omission or mistake in the dispositive portion of the decision, the Supreme Court may clarify such ambiguity by an amendment even after the judgment has become final. (emphasis supplied)â The above decision is in consonance with the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of Buan vs. Court of Appeal, et al., 235 SCRA 424 wherein the Supreme Court said: âx x x Thus the respondent Court stated, âit is undisputed that the Decision of the Court of Appeals x x x had become final and executory.â Taken in this light the respondent court apparently did not err in leaving the issue unresolved, a final decision being unreviewable and conclusive. But judging from the facts presented by this case, it is beyond doubt that serious injustice will be committed if strict adherence to procedural rules were to be followed. It should be remembered that rules of procedure are but mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice, such that when rigid application of the rules would tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, this Court is empowered to suspend its operation. (emphasis supplied)â It would seem from the above pronouncements of the Honorable Supreme Court therefore, that it may suspend the operation of the rules of procedure by virtue of its rule-making power. Certainly if the Honorable Supreme Court has the power to promulgate the Rules of Court, then it has the power to suspend its operation in order to promote substantial justice. Unquestionably, however, the Honorable Court of Appeals does not have that rule[-] making authority. Therefore it may not suspend the operation of the Rules of Court. Moreover, the above discussion refers to civil cases. Will the same doctrines apply to criminal cases as in the cases before us? The accused thru his counsels raised the issues of the effect of a promulgation already once made arguing in the process that another promulgation can no longer be legally feasible if the constitutional right of the accused against double jeopardy will not be violated. We are not unmindful of the injunction upon lower courts, which the Honorable Supreme Court has imposed, i.e., to accept with modesty the orders and decisions of the appellate courts. However, we feel that we must equate this with another injunction, that trial judges must keep abreast with the jurisprudence or run the risk of being found to be grossly ignorant of the law. In short, this Court finds itself in the horns of a dilemma. Since the very jurisprudential authority relied upon by the Honorable [Court] of Appeals refers to the power of the Supreme Court to clarify an ambiguity, may not this Court therefore conclude that the Honorable Court of Appeals does not have the power to clarify the dispositive portion of the decision which has not only become final, but has already been previously promulgated? Finally, it appears to this Court that there is validity to the observation made by counsel for the accused in paragraph 4 of their motion which we quote: â4. It appears, therefore, that there is nothing to promulgate as the same had already been promulgated on April 4, 1995. Besides, there is, likewise, nothing to promulgate in the Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 2, 1996 and much less in the alluded August 17, 1995 Resolution of the Court of Appeals.â Indeed, the said Resolution did not authorize nor did it direct this Court to re-promulgate the Decision. On June 28, 1996, the Solicitor General, representing the People of the Philippines, filed [before the Court of Appeals a] petition for certiorari and mandamus contending that the respondent Judge seriously erred and gravely abused his discretion in refusing to execute the penalty of imprisonment in spite [the Court of Appealsâ] Decision of July 30, 1991 and Resolution of August 17, 1995. He prays that the Order dated April 12, 1996 of respondent Judge be nullified and the penalty of imprisonment rendered against the accused be enforced.â[6] Ruling of the Appellate Court In ruling for the People, the Court of Appeals ratiocinated in this way: âObviously, respondent Judge was of the belief that the penalty of imprisonment was not affirmed by [the Court of Appeals] although it increased the civil liability from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00. He failed to recognize the fact that the only modification made by [the Court of Appeals] on the decision [was] to increase the civil liability, which would not have been imposed if the accused was not found guilty of the charge. Had he looked carefully into the text of the decision he would have found that [the Court of Appeals] affirmed the decision of conviction, as borne out by the following portions of said decision: âAfter a careful review of the evidence on record, this Court entertains no doubt as to the participation of the accused-appellant in the shooting of Sapigao and Rulo Castro. The Court a quo has expressed the following findings in its decision, to which findings this Court accords the great weight and respect such findings of the trial court are entitled to: Conspiracy ... was proven by the following circumstances: 1. Accused Eduardo Cuison was seen together occupying the same table with Sgt. Bustarde and Sgt. Castro drinking beer at the terrace upon the arrival of Leo Petete and his companions; 2. They left the terrace of the Tropical Hut about 10 to 15 minutes after the arrival of Rulo Castro, Rafael Sapigao, Leo Petete and Agardo Reyes and boarded the same yellow car owned and driven by accused Eduardo Cuison. 3. Accused Eduardo Cuison was seen by Ronald Ligayo, a resident of Poblacion, Bugallon, Pangasinan, a disinterested witness in the evening of May 27, 1986 infront (sic) of the house of said accused Eduardo Cuison in Poblacion, Bugallon, Pangasinan. Accused Eduardo Cuison alighted from his car, proceeded to his house and after coming out of his house was seen holding a 45 (sic) caliber and a carbine pistol. Eduardo Cuison called for his brother Warling to whom he handed the carbine pistol and received by the latter. Eduardo Cuison sent Domy Cuison to call for Bot Cuison. When Bot Cuison arrived, he, Warling, Domy, Eduardo Cuison and two others inside the car proceeded towards the north. Obviously, these two were Sgt. Castro and Sgt. Bustarde. 4. Upon arrival of accused Eduardo Cuison, Bot Cuison, Warling Cuison, Domy Cuison, Sgt. Bustarde and Sgt. Castro at the driveway of the Tropical Hut on board the car of accused Eduardo Cuison, each of them with the use of their respective firearms simultaneously fired several shots in the air; 5. Sgt. Castro and Sgt. Bustarde pulled and poked their guns to [sic] Sapigao. Then Sgt. Castro fired the fatal shot to [sic] Sapigao; 6. After Sapigao fell down, Sgt. Castro, Warling Cuison, Eduardo Cuison, Bot and Domy Cuison turned at [sic] Sapigao obviously to see to it and make sure Sapigao was already dead; 7. After ascertaining that Sapigao was shot dead, accused Eduardo Cuison called for Rulo Castro to come outside the restaurant and when Rulo Castro emerged at the door, accused Eduardo Cuison, Warling Cuison, Bot Cuison, Domy Cuison and Sgt. Bustarde simultaneously pointed their guns and shot at Rulo Castro hitting the latter; 8. Accused Eduardo Cuison and Warling Cuison are brothers and uncles of Bot and Domy Cuison. Eduardo Cuison being a kagawad enjoyed moral influence upon his brother Warling and his two nephews Bot and Domy; 9. Sgts. Bustarde and Castro and Kagawad Cuison knew each other before the incident; 10.After shooting the victims to death, the accused Cuisons went away from the scene of the crime on board the same car. The following circumstances showing the sequence of events, the mode o[r] manner in which the offenses were perpetrated taken together indicated that the assailants cooperated and helped each other in the attainment of the same aim. (Memorandum, pp. 20-21) As held by the Supreme Court in the case of People vs. Colman, et al. 55 O.G. 2392 (cited in Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium, â88 ed., Vol. 2, p. 560), Conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence of the acts charged, but may and generally must be proved by a number of indefinite acts, conditions and circumstances which vary according to the purpose to be accomplished. If it be proved that two or more persons aimed by their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their acts, though apparently independent, were in fact connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment, a conspiracy may be inferred though no actual meeting among them for concerted means is proved (People vs. Colman, et. al., 55 O.G. 2393). In the appealed decision, the trial court had ordered the accused-appellant âto indemnify the heirs of Rafael Sapigao [in] the amount of P30,000.00 and to [sic] the heirs of Rulo Castro also the amount of P30,000.00â (Decision, p. 24). In accordance with the new policy of the Supreme Court on this matter, the above-specified amount of P30,000.00 should be increased to P50,000.00 (People vs. Sison, 189 SCRA 643, 646).â It is absurd to conclude that [the Court of Appeals] increased the civil liability in accordance with new rulings of the Supreme Court without finding that the accused [was] guilty of the offense of homicide. Thus, the promulgation of the civil liability only and omission of the criminal liability is an error. Furthermore, [the Court of Appeals] has clarified the ambiguity in the dispositive portion through its Resolution dated August 17, 1995 which categorically stated that the court affirmed the decision of the respondent court with respect to the penalty of imprisonment imposed upon the accused. This clarification is not an amendment, modification, correction or alteration to an already final decision. It is conceded that such cannot be done anymore. The Court of Appeals simply stated in categorical terms what it obviously meant in its decision - - that the conviction of the accused is affirmed with the modification that the civil liability is increased. The dispositive portion of the decision may not have used the exact words but a reading of the decision can lead to no other conclusion. It certainly would be ridiculous to allow the accused to go scot-free after paying the heirs the civil indemnity imposed by the Court for his participation in the act of killing the two (2) victims in these cases, because of a wrong interpretation of a decision.â[7]' Hence, this appeal.[8] The Issues In this appeal, Petitioner Eduardo Cuison raises the following âassignment of errorsâ: âI. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in not holding that the Solicitor General failed to establish the requisites for the issuance of the extraordinary writ of certiorari . II. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in not holding that the Solicitor General failed to show the existence of the elements for the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus. III. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in not holding that the promulgation of April 4, 1995 cannot be modified, over objection of the accused. IV. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in not holding that the filing of the Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus dated June 28, 1995 by the Solicitor General violates the constitutional right of the accused against double jeopardy. V. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in deciding as it did and in denying herein petitionerâs motion for reconsideration.â[9] Simply put, petitioner raises the following issues: (1) whether the writs of certiorari and mandamus were properly issued by the Court of Appeals, and (2) whether petitionerâs right against double jeopardy was violated. The Courtâs Ruling The petition is utterly unmeritorious. First Issue: Certiorari and Mandamus Justified A petition for certiorari is allowed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, provided the following requisites are present: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or an officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[10] Grave abuse of discretion â x x x implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, or, in other words where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.â[11] Petitioner points out that the solicitor generalâs petition for certiorari and mandamus before the Court of Appeals failed to show grave abuse of discretion in the assailed April 12, 1996 Resolution of the trial court. In the said Resolution, the trial court declined to order the incarceration of petitioner and, thus, effectively refused to promulgate the August 17, 1995 CA Decision which, in turn, clarified that the CAâs earlier Decision dated July 30, 1991 merely increased the amount of indemnity but did not delete the penalty of imprisonment. In justifying its said Order, the trial court insisted that it had already promulgated the July 30, 1991 CA Decision when it ordered petitioner to pay the increased amount of indemnity. Petitioner argues that the trial courtâs Order, âfar from being whimsical, capricious or malevolent, [was] valid and substantial, to say the least, and the impugned [R]esolution was issued after a careful deliberation and weighing of the facts, issues and points of applicable law.â[12] We disagree. While its language may have been a little faulty, it is still quite obvious that the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâs Decision convicting Petitioner Eduardo Cuison of double homicide. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision, therefore, cannot be construed to mean that the appellate court merely imposed an indemnity and deleted the penalty of imprisonment. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appealsâ Decision in no way communicated that the appealed Decision of the trial court was modified only in regard to the amount of indemnity. Nowhere could it be gleaned that the penalty of imprisonment was deleted. In fact, the CA Decision and the entire records of this case contain no legal or factual basis for acquitting petitioner or dismissing the criminal cases against him. In granting petitionerâs motion, the trial court judge capriciously and arbitrarily decided not to promulgate the Court of Appealsâ July 30, 1991 Decision.[13] He had no discretion to refuse; his refusal was thus a glaring transgression of his jurisdiction. We must also emphasize that we dismissed the petition questioning the Court of Appealâs July 30, 1991 Decision, thereby affirming the conviction of petitioner. The trial courtâs assailed April 12, 1996 Resolution was therefore âtantamount to overruling a judicial pronouncement of the highest Court of the land affirming the judgment of conviction of respondent Courtâ and âunmistakably a very grave abuse of discretion.â[14] Manifestly erroneous then is the trial judgeâs justification that he has previously promulgated the Court of Appealsâ Decision on April 4, 1995. As already stated, the penalty imposed by the Court of Appeals was imprisonment plus a higher amount of civil indemnity. In ordering only the payment of the indemnity, the trial court failed to execute the CA Decision in its entirety. Notwithstanding the subsequent CA Decision clarifying -- and this Courtâs dismissal of the petition questioning -- the said earlier CA Decision, the trial court still adamantly refused to do so. The persistent refusal of the trial court is a clear display of grave abuse of discretion. We find misleading the claim of petitioner that the Court of Appeals itself acknowledged that the latterâs July 30, 1991 Decision was âambiguous and obscure.â[15] Such claim is bereft of factual basis. Nowhere in its Resolution[16] did the CA so describe its previous Decision. It merely restated the import of its July 30, 1991 Decision. Evidently, this was either misunderstood or distorted by the trial court, which stated that âit is ineluctable that the penalty imposed by the lower court was not touched on at all by [the Court of Appeals] x x x.â[17] Furthermore, the Court of Appeals cannot be faulted for issuing a writ of mandamus, in view of the trial courtâs refusal to perform its ministerial duty of promulgating the appellate courtâs Decision in its entirety. Under Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, a petition for mandamus is warranted â[w]hen any tribunal, corporation, board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station x x x.â [18] Obedience to a superior courtâs order is a ministerial duty of lower courts. Lastly, petitioner contends that the petition for certiorari filed before the Court of Appeals was improper, because the People had not filed a motion for reconsideration of the assailed trial court Order.[19] This contention is bereft of merit. A motion for reconsideration need not precede a petition for certiorari where the questioned resolution was a patent nullity, as in this case.[20] Second Issue: Promulgation of Conviction Not Barred by Double Jeopardy Petitioner submits that the trial courtâs promulgation of the CA Decision on April 4, 1995 âcannot be set aside and a second promulgation be orderedâ[21] because to do so would contravene the prohibition against double jeopardy.[22] He contends that the judgment as promulgated on April 4, 1995 has become final[23] and that courts have thus lost jurisdiction over the case.[24] To substantiate a claim of double jeopardy, the following must be proven: â x x x (1) a first jeopardy must have attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy must have been validly terminated; (3) the second jeopardy must be for the same offense, or the second offense includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the first information, or is an attempt to commit the same or is a frustration thereof (citations omitted). And legal jeopardy attaches only: (a) upon a valid indictment; (b) before a competent court; (c) after arraignment; (d) [when] a valid plea [has] been entered; and (e) the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the accused (citation omitted).â[25] Petitioner contends that âthe promulgation by Judge Ramos on April 4, 1995 of the Respondent Courtâs decision of June 30, 1991 by reading its dispositive portion has effectively terminated the criminal cases against the petitioner x x x.â[26] In other words, petitioner claims that the first jeopardy attached at that point. The Court is not persuaded. As a rule, a criminal prosecution includes a civil action for the recovery of indemnity.[27] Hence, a decision in such case disposes of both the criminal as well as the civil liabilities of an accused. Here, trial court promulgated only the civil aspect of the case, but not the criminal. As earlier observed, the promulgation of the CA Decision was not complete. In fact and in truth, the promulgation was not merely incomplete; it was also void. In excess of its jurisdiction, the trial judge rendered a substantially incomplete promulgation on April 4, 1995, and he repeated his mistake in his April 12, 1996 Order. We emphasize that grave abuse of discretion rendered the aforementioned act of the trial court void.[28] Since the criminal cases have not yet been terminated, the first jeopardy has not yet attached. Hence, double jeopardy cannot prosper as a defense.[29] We must stress that Respondent Courtâs questioned Decision did not modify or amend its July 30, 1991 Decision. It merely ordered the promulgation of the judgment of conviction and the full execution of the penalty it had earlier imposed on petitioner. Cases Cited Not Applicable People vs. Hernando, Ramos vs. Hodges and Republic vs. Court of Appeals, cited by petitioner, are not applicable because they refer either to the lower courtâs proceeding that is not void or to errors of judgment, not to lack or excess or abuse of jurisdiction. Thus, in People vs. Hernando,[30] the Court ruled that the questioned proceedings of the court a quo âwere not an absolute nullity as to render the judgment of acquittal null and void,â considering that the prosecution was not denied due process. In Ramos vs. Hodges[31] the Court found that the trial judgeâs erroneous conclusion merely constituted âerrors of fact or of law,â and not of jurisdiction. Lastly, in Republic vs. Court of Appeals[32] the Court held that the lower court committed merely âan error of judgment and not an error of jurisdiction as there was no clear showing [that it] exercised its power in [an] arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that its act was so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.â Epilogue This Court takes this occasion to remind members of the bench to be precise in their ponencias, most especially in the dispositions thereof. Accuracy and clarity in substance and in language are revered objectives in decision-making. Having said that, we also lament the trial courtâs convoluted attempt at sophistry, which obviously enabled the petitioner to delay the service of his imprisonment and to unnecessarily clog the dockets of this Court and of the Court of Appeals. His Honorâs expressed desire âto accept with modesty the orders and decisions of the appellate courtâ was, in truth and in fact, merely a sarcastic prelude to his veiled rejection of the superior courtâs order modifying his earlier decision. His sophomoric justification of his refusal to obey for fear of âbeing found to be grossly ignorant of the lawâ does not deserve one whit of sympathy from this Court. Lady Justice may be blindfolded but she is neither blind nor naive. She can distinguish chicanery from wisdom, fallacious argument from common sense.

No. 128540, April 15, 1998 ]\n\nEDUARDO CUISON, PETITIONER,\nVS. COURT OF APPEALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nEDUARDO CUISON, PETITIONER,\nVS. COURT OF APPEALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nThe constitutional\nproscription of double jeopardy is not violated by a Court of Appeals order\nrequiring the trial court to promulgate a decision sentencing the accused to\nimprisonment even if, earlier, the same decision has been promulgated in regard\nonly to the payment of the modified civil indemnity arising from the same\ncriminal act. Otherwise stated, the\npromulgation of only one part of the decision, i.e. , the liability for\ncivil indemnity, is not a bar to the subsequent promulgation of the other part,\nthe imposition of the criminal accountability.\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is the gist\nof this Courtâs resolution of the petition for review on certiorari , assailing the November 5, 1996 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals [2] in CA-GR SP No. 41096. The dispositive portion of the said\nDecision, which set aside the April 12, 1996 Resolution [3] of the Regional Trial Court of\nLingayen, Pangasinan, Branch 39, [4] reads as follows: âWHEREFORE, premises\nconsidered, the Resolution dated April 12, 1996 of the respondent Judge is\nhereby SET ASIDE and he is ordered to set anew the promulgation of the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of conviction and\nsentencing the accused to serve imprisonment for the duration stated in the\ndecision of the said respondent Court dated February 7, 1989. The order for the payment of the civil\nliabilities has been promulgated earlier. SO\nORDERED.â [5]\n\nThe RTC\nResolution, set aside by the Court of Appeals, disposed: âWHEREFORE, in view of the\nforegoing considerations, the Court finds that the âUrgent Motion to Set Aside\nPromulgationâ filed by the accused thru counsel, is meritorious and\naccordingly, the same is hereby granted.â\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe undisputed\nfacts of this case, as narrated by the Court of Appeals, are reproduced below: âOn February 7, 1989,\nrespondent Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan (Branch\n39) rendered a Joint Decision in Criminal Cases Nos. L-3553 and L-3554, the\ndispositive portion of which is as follows:\n\nâWHEREFORE, judgment is\nhereby rendered finding accused Eduardo Cuison guilty of the crime of double\nhomicide, beyond reasonable doubt and therefore sentences him to suffer\nimprisonment from 6 years and 1 day of [p]rision [m]ayor as [m]inimum to\n12 years and 1 day of [r]eclusion [t]emporal as [m]aximum, for each\noffense, with the accessories provided by law and to pay the costs. Accused is also ordered to indemnify the\nheirs of Rafael Sapigao the amount of P 30,000.00 and the heirs of Rulo\nCastro also the amount of P 30,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in\ncase of insolvency.â On appeal to the Court of\nAppeals, the said decision was affirmed with the modification that the civil\nindemnity was increased to P 50,000.00. The dispositive portion of said Decision of this Court dated July 30,\n1991 reads:\n\nâPREMISES CONSIDERED, the\njoint decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by ordering accused Eduardo\nCuison to indemnify the heirs of Rafael Sapigao the amount of P 50,000.00\nand the heirs of Rulo Castro also the amount of P 50,000.00 without\nsubsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.â The accused elevated the\ndecision on a petition for review docketed as G.R. Nos. 108985-86 but the\nSupreme Court denied the said petition on December 1, 1993. The case was remanded to\nthe Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan (Br. 39) for promulgation of the\ndecision. However, respondent Judge\npromulgated [on April 4, 1995] the decision of [the Court of Appeals] only with\nrespect to the modified civil liability of the accused but did not commit the\naccused to jail to commence service of his sentence. Asst. City Prosecutor\nAbraham L. Ramos II reported the matter to the Solicitor General and requested\nthat a motion for clarification be filed with this Court to clarify the\ndecision dated July 30, 1991. On July\n7, 1995, the Solicitor General filed a Motion to Clarify Decision. On August 17, 1995, [the Court of Appeals]\nrendered a Resolution which states in pertinent portions thereof:\n\nâIn the dispositive portion\nof this Courtâs decision, We simply modified the appealed decision of the court a quo in one respect only - the increase of the indemnity to be\npaid by the appellant to the heirs of the victims from P 30,000.00 to P 50,000.00\nas ruled in various cases including that cited in Our decision, People vs.\nSison, 189 SCRA 643, 646.\n\nIn view of the foregoing,\nit is ineluctable that the penalty imposed by the lower court was not touched\non at all by this Court especially in the light of [o]ur [o]bservation in the\nsaid decision, as follows:\n\nâAfter a careful review of the\nevidence on records, this Court entertains no doubt as to the participation of\nthe accused-appellant in the shooting of Sapigao and Rulo Castro. The court a quo has expressed the\nfollowing findings in its decision, to which findings this Court accords the\ngreat weight and respect such findings of the trial court are entitled to:\n\nConspiracy . . . was proven by the\nfollowing circumstances:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe following circumstances showing\nthe sequence of events, the mode or manner in which the offenses were perpetrated\ntaken together indicated that the assailants cooperated and helped each other\nin the attainment of the same aim. (Memorandum, pp. 20-21) (CA Decision, pp. 14-16; Rollo , pp.\n127-129)â\n\nActing on the afore-cited motion to\nclarify decision, this Court hereby declares that this Court had affirmed the decision of the court a quo with regard to the penalty of\nimprisonment imposed in the said trial courtâs decision.â Respondent Judge then set\nthe promulgation of the decision anew. The accused, however, filed a Motion to Set Aside Promulgation on the\nfollowing grounds:\n\nâ1. That the judgment in said case was already promulgated\non 4 April 1995 and therefore there is nothing to promulgate anymore.\n\n2. To pursue with [sic] the scheduled promulgation will violate\nthe accusedâs constitutional right against jeopardy.â In a Resolution dated April\n12, 1996, the respondent Judge granted the aforestated motion holding:\n\nâNow, the question is: May\nthe resolution of the Honorable Court of Appeals promulgated on 17 August 1995\nwhich âclarifiedâ the dispositive portion of its original decision, be\nconsidered as an amendment, alteration or modification of the decision? Here, we must not forget the basic rule that\nin the execution of the judgment, it is the dispositive portion of the\ndecision which controls. We cannot also\nforget that, as already mentioned above, we have already promulgated the said\ndecision by reading to the accused the dispositive portion, and that to the\nbest of our knowledge, he had already complied therewith by paying the damages\nwhich were awarded. It may be relevant\nat this point in time, to cite the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in\nthe case of Heirs of George Bofill vs. Court of Appeals, 237 SCRA 393 that\n\nâHad the Court of Appeals\nbeen more accurate and precise in quoting data from the records, it would have\narrived at the right conclusionâ\n\nThe Honorable Court of\nAppeals cited the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of\nPartola-Jo vs. CA, 216 SCRA 692, that:\n\nâWhere there is an\nambiguity caused by an omission or mistake in the dispositive portion of the\ndecision, the Supreme Court may clarify such ambiguity by an amendment even\nafter the judgment has become final . (emphasis supplied)â\n\nThe above decision is in\nconsonance with the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of Buan\nvs. Court of Appeal, et al . , 235 SCRA 424 wherein the Supreme Court\nsaid:\n\nâx x x Thus the respondent\nCourt stated, âit is undisputed that the Decision of the Court of Appeals x x x\nhad become final and executory.â Taken\nin this light the respondent court apparently did not err in leaving the\nissue unresolved , a final decision being unreviewable and conclusive.\n\nBut judging from the facts\npresented by this case, it is beyond doubt that serious injustice will be\ncommitted if strict adherence to procedural rules were to be followed. It should be remembered that rules of\nprocedure are but mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice,\nsuch that when rigid application of the rules would tend to frustrate rather\nthan promote substantial justice, this Court is empowered to suspend its\noperation. (emphasis supplied)â\n\nIt would seem from the\nabove pronouncements of the Honorable Supreme Court therefore, that it may\nsuspend the operation of the rules of procedure by virtue of its rule-making\npower. Certainly if the Honorable\nSupreme Court has the power to promulgate the Rules of Court, then it has the\npower to suspend its operation in order to promote substantial\njustice. Unquestionably, however, the\nHonorable Court of Appeals does not have that rule[-] making\nauthority. Therefore it may not suspend\nthe operation of the Rules of Court.\n\nMoreover, the above\ndiscussion refers to civil cases. Will\nthe same doctrines apply to criminal cases as in the cases before us? The accused thru his counsels raised the\nissues of the effect of a promulgation already once made arguing in the process\nthat another promulgation can no longer be legally feasible if the constitutional\nright of the accused against double jeopardy will not be violated.\n\nWe are not unmindful of the\ninjunction upon lower courts, which the Honorable Supreme Court has imposed,\ni.e., to accept with modesty the orders and decisions of the appellate\ncourts. However, we feel that we must equate\nthis with another injunction, that trial judges must keep abreast with the\njurisprudence or run the risk of being found to be grossly ignorant of the\nlaw. In short, this Court finds itself\nin the horns of a dilemma. Since the\nvery jurisprudential authority relied upon by the Honorable [Court] of Appeals\nrefers to the power of the Supreme Court to clarify an ambiguity, may\nnot this Court therefore conclude that the Honorable Court of Appeals does not\nhave the power to clarify the dispositive portion of the decision which has not\nonly become final, but has already been previously promulgated?\n\nFinally, it appears to this\nCourt that there is validity to the observation made by counsel for the accused\nin paragraph 4 of their motion which we quote:\n\nâ4. It appears, therefore, that there is nothing to promulgate as the\nsame had already been promulgated on April 4, 1995. Besides, there is, likewise, nothing to promulgate in the Court\nof Appeals Resolution dated February 2, 1996 and much less in the alluded August\n17, 1995 Resolution of the Court of Appeals.â\n\nIndeed, the said Resolution\ndid not authorize nor did it direct this Court to re-promulgate the Decision. On June 28, 1996, the\nSolicitor General, representing the People of the Philippines, filed [before the\nCourt of Appeals a] petition for certiorari and mandamus contending that the respondent Judge seriously erred and gravely abused his\ndiscretion in refusing to execute the penalty of imprisonment in spite [the\nCourt of Appealsâ] Decision of July 30, 1991 and Resolution of August 17,\n1995. He prays that the Order dated\nApril 12, 1996 of respondent Judge be nullified and the penalty of imprisonment\nrendered against the accused be enforced.â [6]\n\nRuling of the Appellate Court\n\nIn ruling for\nthe People, the Court of Appeals ratiocinated in this way: âObviously, respondent\nJudge was of the belief that the penalty of imprisonment was not affirmed by\n[the Court of Appeals] although it increased the civil liability from P 30,000.00\nto P 50,000.00. He failed to\nrecognize the fact that the only modification made by [the Court of Appeals] on\nthe decision [was] to increase the civil liability, which would not have been\nimposed if the accused was not found guilty of the charge. Had he looked carefully into the text of the\ndecision he would have found that [the Court of Appeals] affirmed the decision\nof conviction, as borne out by the following portions of said decision:\n\nâAfter a careful review of\nthe evidence on record, this Court entertains no doubt as to the participation of\nthe accused-appellant in the shooting of Sapigao and Rulo Castro. The Court a quo has expressed the\nfollowing findings in its decision, to which findings this Court accords the\ngreat weight and respect such findings of the trial court are entitled to:\n\nConspiracy\n... was proven by the following circumstances:\n\n1. Accused Eduardo Cuison was seen together occupying the same table\nwith Sgt. Bustarde and Sgt. Castro drinking beer at the terrace upon the\narrival of Leo Petete and his companions;\n\n2. They left the terrace of the Tropical Hut about 10 to 15 minutes\nafter the arrival of Rulo Castro, Rafael Sapigao, Leo Petete and Agardo Reyes\nand boarded the same yellow car owned and driven by accused Eduardo Cuison.\n\n3. Accused Eduardo Cuison was seen by Ronald Ligayo, a resident of\nPoblacion, Bugallon, Pangasinan, a disinterested witness in the evening of May\n27, 1986 infront (sic) of the house of said accused Eduardo Cuison in\nPoblacion, Bugallon, Pangasinan. Accused Eduardo Cuison alighted from his car, proceeded to his house and\nafter coming out of his house was seen holding a 45 (sic) caliber and a carbine\npistol. Eduardo Cuison called for his\nbrother Warling to whom he handed the carbine pistol and received by the latter.\n\nEduardo Cuison sent Domy\nCuison to call for Bot Cuison. When Bot\nCuison arrived, he, Warling, Domy, Eduardo Cuison and two others inside the car\nproceeded towards the north. Obviously,\nthese two were Sgt. Castro and Sgt. Bustarde.\n\n4. Upon arrival of accused Eduardo Cuison, Bot Cuison, Warling Cuison,\nDomy Cuison, Sgt. Bustarde and Sgt. Castro at the driveway of the Tropical Hut\non board the car of accused Eduardo Cuison, each of them with the use of their\nrespective firearms simultaneously fired several shots in the air;\n\n5. Sgt. Castro and Sgt. Bustarde pulled and poked their guns to [sic]\nSapigao. Then Sgt. Castro fired the\nfatal shot to [sic] Sapigao;\n\n6. After Sapigao fell down, Sgt. Castro, Warling Cuison, Eduardo\nCuison, Bot and Domy Cuison turned at [sic] Sapigao obviously to see to it and\nmake sure Sapigao was already dead;\n\n7. After ascertaining that Sapigao was shot dead, accused Eduardo\nCuison called for Rulo Castro to come outside the restaurant and when Rulo\nCastro emerged at the door, accused Eduardo Cuison, Warling Cuison, Bot Cuison,\nDomy Cuison and Sgt. Bustarde simultaneously pointed their guns and shot at\nRulo Castro hitting the latter;\n\n8. Accused Eduardo Cuison and Warling Cuison are brothers and uncles of\nBot and Domy Cuison. Eduardo Cuison\nbeing a kagawad enjoyed moral influence upon his brother Warling and his two\nnephews Bot and Domy;\n\n9. Sgts. Bustarde and Castro and Kagawad Cuison knew each other before\nthe incident;\n\n10.After shooting the\nvictims to death, the accused Cuisons went away from the scene of the crime on\nboard the same car.\n\nThe following circumstances\nshowing the sequence of events, the mode o[r] manner in which the offenses were\nperpetrated taken together indicated that the assailants cooperated and helped\neach other in the attainment of the same aim. (Memorandum, pp. 20-21)\n\nAs held by the Supreme\nCourt in the case of People vs. Colman, et al. 55 O.G. 2392 (cited in\nRegalado, Remedial Law Compendium, â88 ed., Vol. 2, p. 560),\n\nConspiracy need not be\nestablished by direct evidence of the acts charged, but may and generally must\nbe proved by a number of indefinite acts, conditions and circumstances which\nvary according to the purpose to be accomplished. If it be proved that two or more persons aimed by their acts\ntowards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so\nthat their acts, though apparently independent, were in fact connected and\ncooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence\nof sentiment, a conspiracy may be inferred though no actual meeting among them\nfor concerted means is proved (People vs. Colman, et. al. , 55 O.G.\n2393).\n\nIn the appealed decision,\nthe trial court had ordered the accused-appellant âto indemnify the heirs of\nRafael Sapigao [in] the amount of P 30,000.00 and to [sic] the heirs of\nRulo Castro also the amount of P 30,000.00â (Decision, p. 24). In accordance with the new policy of the\nSupreme Court on this matter, the above-specified amount of P 30,000.00\nshould be increased to P 50,000.00 (People vs. Sison, 189 SCRA 643,\n646).â It is absurd to conclude\nthat [the Court of Appeals] increased the civil liability in accordance with\nnew rulings of the Supreme Court without finding that the accused [was] guilty\nof the offense of homicide. Thus, the\npromulgation of the civil liability only and omission of the criminal liability\nis an error. Furthermore, [the Court of\nAppeals] has clarified the ambiguity in the dispositive portion through its\nResolution dated August 17, 1995 which categorically stated that the court\naffirmed the decision of the respondent court with respect to the penalty of\nimprisonment imposed upon the accused. This clarification is not\nan amendment, modification, correction or alteration to an already final\ndecision. It is conceded that such\ncannot be done anymore. The Court of Appeals\nsimply stated in categorical terms what it obviously meant in its decision - -\nthat the conviction of the accused is affirmed with the modification that the\ncivil liability is increased. The\ndispositive portion of the decision may not have used the exact words but a\nreading of the decision can lead to no other conclusion. It certainly would be\nridiculous to allow the accused to go scot-free after paying the heirs the\ncivil indemnity imposed by the Court for his participation in the act of\nkilling the two (2) victims in these cases, because of a wrong interpretation\nof a decision.â [7] '\n\nHence, this\nappeal. [8]\n\nThe Issues\n\nIn this appeal,\nPetitioner Eduardo Cuison raises the following âassignment of errorsâ: âI. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its\ndiscretion in not holding that the Solicitor General failed to establish the\nrequisites for the issuance of the extraordinary writ of certiorari . II. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its\ndiscretion in not holding that the Solicitor General failed to show the\nexistence of the elements for the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus . III. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its\ndiscretion in not holding that the promulgation of April 4, 1995 cannot be\nmodified, over objection of the accused. IV. The Respondent Court seriously erred and gravely abused its\ndiscretion in not holding that the filing of the Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus dated June 28, 1995 by\nthe Solicitor General violates the constitutional right of the accused against\ndouble jeopardy. V. The Respondent Court seriously erred and\ngravely abused its discretion in deciding as it did and in denying herein\npetitionerâs motion for reconsideration.â [9]\n\nSimply put,\npetitioner raises the following issues: (1) whether the writs of certiorari and mandamus were properly issued by\nthe Court of Appeals, and (2) whether petitionerâs right against double\njeopardy was violated.\n\nThe Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe petition is\nutterly unmeritorious.\n\nFirst Issue: Certiorari\nand Mandamus Justified\n\nA petition for certiorari is allowed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, provided the following\nrequisites are present: (1) the writ is\ndirected against a tribunal, a board or an officer exercising judicial or\nquasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without\nor in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to\nlack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy\nand adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. [10] Grave abuse of discretion â x x x\nimplies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to\nlack of jurisdiction, or, in other words where the power is exercised in an\narbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it\nmust be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a\nvirtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation\nof law.â [11]\n\nPetitioner points\nout that the solicitor generalâs petition for certiorari and mandamus before the Court of Appeals failed to show grave abuse of discretion in the\nassailed April 12, 1996 Resolution of the trial court. In the said Resolution, the trial court\ndeclined to order the incarceration of petitioner and, thus, effectively\nrefused to promulgate the August 17, 1995 CA Decision which, in turn, clarified\nthat the CAâs earlier Decision dated July 30, 1991 merely increased the amount\nof indemnity but did not delete the penalty of imprisonment. In justifying its said Order, the trial\ncourt insisted that it had already promulgated the July 30, 1991 CA Decision\nwhen it ordered petitioner to pay the increased amount of indemnity. Petitioner argues that the trial courtâs\nOrder, âfar from being whimsical, capricious or malevolent, [was] valid and\nsubstantial, to say the least, and the impugned [R]esolution was issued after a\ncareful deliberation and weighing of the facts, issues and points of applicable\nlaw.â [12]\n\nWe disagree. While its language may have been a little\nfaulty, it is still quite obvious that the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial\ncourtâs Decision convicting Petitioner Eduardo Cuison of double homicide. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision,\ntherefore, cannot be construed to mean that the appellate court merely imposed\nan indemnity and deleted the penalty of imprisonment. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appealsâ Decision in no\nway communicated that the appealed Decision of the trial court was modified\nonly in regard to the amount of indemnity. Nowhere could it be gleaned that the penalty of imprisonment was\ndeleted. In fact, the CA Decision and\nthe entire records of this case contain no legal or factual basis for\nacquitting petitioner or dismissing the criminal cases against him.\n\nIn granting\npetitionerâs motion, the trial court judge capriciously and arbitrarily decided\nnot to promulgate the Court of Appealsâ July 30, 1991 Decision. [13] He had no discretion to refuse; his\nrefusal was thus a glaring transgression of his jurisdiction.\n\nWe must also\nemphasize that we dismissed the petition questioning the Court of Appealâs July\n30, 1991 Decision, thereby affirming the conviction of petitioner. The trial courtâs assailed April 12, 1996\nResolution was therefore âtantamount to overruling a judicial pronouncement of\nthe highest Court of the land affirming the judgment of conviction of\nrespondent Courtâ and âunmistakably a very grave abuse of discretion.â [14]\n\nManifestly\nerroneous then is the trial judgeâs justification that he has previously\npromulgated the Court of Appealsâ Decision on April 4, 1995. As already stated, the penalty imposed by the Court of Appeals was imprisonment plus\na higher amount of civil indemnity. In\nordering only the payment of the indemnity, the trial court failed to execute\nthe CA Decision in its entirety. Notwithstanding the subsequent CA Decision clarifying -- and this\nCourtâs dismissal of the petition questioning -- the said earlier CA Decision,\nthe trial court still adamantly refused to do so. The persistent refusal of the trial court is a clear display of\ngrave abuse of discretion.\n\nWe find\nmisleading the claim of petitioner that the Court of Appeals itself\nacknowledged that the latterâs July 30, 1991 Decision was âambiguous and obscure.â [15] Such claim is bereft of factual\nbasis. Nowhere in its Resolution [16] did the CA so describe its previous\nDecision. It merely restated the import\nof its July 30, 1991 Decision. Evidently, this was either misunderstood or distorted by the trial court,\nwhich stated that âit is ineluctable that the penalty imposed by the lower\ncourt was not touched on at all by [the Court of Appeals] x x x.â [17]\n\nFurthermore, the\nCourt of Appeals cannot be faulted for issuing a writ of mandamus , in\nview of the trial courtâs refusal to perform its ministerial duty of\npromulgating the appellate courtâs Decision in its entirety. Under Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of\nCourt, a petition for mandamus is warranted â[w]hen any tribunal,\ncorporation, board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act\nwhich the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station x x x.â [18] Obedience to a superior courtâs\norder is a ministerial duty of lower courts.\n\nLastly,\npetitioner contends that the petition for certiorari filed before the Court of Appeals was\nimproper, because the People had not filed a motion for reconsideration of the\nassailed trial court Order. [19] This contention is bereft of\nmerit. A motion for reconsideration\nneed not precede a petition for certiorari where the questioned\nresolution was a patent nullity, as in this case. [20]\n\nSecond\nIssue: Promulgation of Conviction\n\nNot Barred by Double Jeopardy\n\nPetitioner\nsubmits that the trial courtâs promulgation of the CA Decision on April 4, 1995\nâcannot be set aside and a second promulgation be orderedâ [21] because to do so would contravene\nthe prohibition against double jeopardy. [22] He contends that the judgment as\npromulgated on April 4, 1995 has become final [23] and that courts have thus lost\njurisdiction over the case. [24]\n\nTo substantiate\na claim of double jeopardy, the following must be proven: â x x x (1) a first jeopardy must have attached prior to\nthe second; (2) the first jeopardy must have been validly\nterminated; (3) the second jeopardy must be for the same\noffense, or the second offense includes or is necessarily included in the\noffense charged in the first information, or is an attempt to commit the same\nor is a frustration thereof (citations omitted). And legal jeopardy attaches\nonly: (a) upon a valid indictment; (b) before a competent\ncourt; (c) after arraignment; (d) [when] a valid plea [has]\nbeen entered; and (e) the case was dismissed or otherwise\nterminated without the express consent of the accused (citation omitted).â [25]\n\nPetitioner\ncontends that âthe promulgation by Judge Ramos on April 4, 1995 of the\nRespondent Courtâs decision of June 30, 1991 by reading its dispositive portion has effectively terminated the criminal cases against the petitioner x x\nx.â [26] In other words, petitioner claims\nthat the first jeopardy attached at that point.\n\nThe Court is not\npersuaded. As a rule, a criminal\nprosecution includes a civil action for the recovery of indemnity. [27] Hence, a decision in such case\ndisposes of both the criminal as well as the civil liabilities of an\naccused. Here, trial court promulgated\nonly the civil aspect of the case, but not the criminal.\n\nAs earlier\nobserved, the promulgation of the CA Decision was not complete. In fact and in truth, the promulgation was\nnot merely incomplete; it was also void. In excess of its jurisdiction, the trial judge rendered a substantially\nincomplete promulgation on April 4, 1995, and he repeated his mistake in his\nApril 12, 1996 Order. We emphasize that\ngrave abuse of discretion rendered the aforementioned act of the trial court\nvoid. [28] Since the criminal cases have not\nyet been terminated, the first jeopardy has not yet attached. Hence, double jeopardy cannot prosper as a\ndefense. [29]\n\nWe must stress\nthat Respondent Courtâs questioned Decision did not modify or amend its July\n30, 1991 Decision. It merely ordered\nthe promulgation of the judgment of conviction and the full execution of the\npenalty it had earlier imposed on petitioner.\n\nCases Cited Not Applicable\n\nPeople vs.\nHernando , Ramos\nvs. Hodges and Republic vs. Court of Appeals, cited by petitioner,\nare not applicable because they refer\neither to the lower courtâs proceeding that is not void or to errors of\njudgment, not to lack or excess or abuse of jurisdiction. Thus, in People vs. Hernando, [30] the Court ruled that the questioned\nproceedings of the court a quo âwere not an absolute nullity as to\nrender the judgment of acquittal null and void,â considering that the\nprosecution was not denied due process. In Ramos vs. Hodges [31] the Court found that the trial judgeâs erroneous\nconclusion merely constituted âerrors of fact or of law,â and not of\njurisdiction. Lastly, in Republic\nvs. Court of Appeals [32] the Court held that the lower court\ncommitted merely âan error of judgment and not an error of jurisdiction as\nthere was no clear showing [that it] exercised its power in [an] arbitrary or\ndespotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that its act was\nso patent and gross as to amount to an evasion or a virtual refusal to perform\nthe duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.â\n\nEpilogue\n\nThis Court takes\nthis occasion to remind members of the bench to be precise in their ponencias ,\nmost especially in the dispositions thereof. Accuracy and clarity in substance and in language are revered objectives\nin decision-making.\n\nHaving said\nthat, we also lament the trial courtâs convoluted attempt at sophistry, which\nobviously enabled the petitioner to delay the service of his imprisonment and to\nunnecessarily clog the dockets of this Court and of the Court of Appeals. His Honorâs expressed desire âto accept with\nmodesty the orders and decisions of the appellate courtâ was, in truth and in\nfact, merely a sarcastic prelude to his veiled rejection of the superior\ncourtâs order modifying his earlier decision. His sophomoric justification of his refusal to obey for fear of âbeing\nfound to be grossly ignorant of the lawâ does not deserve one whit of sympathy\nfrom this Court. Lady Justice may be\nblindfolded but she is neither blind nor naive. She can distinguish chicanery from wisdom, fallacious argument\nfrom common sense.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED and the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED .
