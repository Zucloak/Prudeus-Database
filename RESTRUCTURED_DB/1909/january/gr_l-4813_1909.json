No. L-4813              January 23, 1909\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\nplaintiff-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nPOTENCIANO SIAMSICO,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nJose Ma. Rosado, for appellant.\n\nAttorney-General Villamor, for appellee.\n\nCARSON,\n\nJ.\n\n:\n\nThe guilt of the accused of the crime of which he was convicted in the trial court is conclusively established beyond a reasonable doubt, and we find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused.\n\nCounsel for appellant contends that the sentence imposed is in excess of that provided by law for the crime of theft, of which the accused was convicted. It appears that the convict was a domestic servant in the house of the owner of the stolen property at the time when the crime was committed, hence, under the provisions of articles 520 of the Penal Code, it was the duty of the court to impose a penalty immediately superior to that prescribed for the commission of the offense in the absence of such circumstance.\n\nThe crime committed is defined and penalized in section 3, of article 518, taken together with section 2 of article 520, of the Penal Code. The value of the stolen property being in excess of 250 pesetas, but not in exceeding 1,250 pesetas, the penalty prescribed in article 518 for this offense is that of\n\narresto mayor\n\nin its medium degree to\n\npresidio correccional\n\nin its minimum degree. The penalty immediately superior thereto, which is prescribed in article 520 when theft is committed by a domestic servant, is that of\n\npresidio correccional\n\nin its medium degree to\n\npresidio mayor\n\nin its minimum degree, and there being no aggravating or extenuating circumstances, this penalty should be imposed in its medium degree, that is to say, from four years, two months, and one day to six years of\n\npresidio correccional\n\n.\n\nThe judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court imposing four year, two months, and one day of\n\npresidio correccional\n\nupon the accused, should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Willard, and Tracey, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
