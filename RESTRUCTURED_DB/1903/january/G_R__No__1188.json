No. 1188            January 31, 1903\n\nGABRIEL FUSTER,\n\npetitioner,\n\nvs.\n\nE.F. JOHNSON, judge of first instance of Manila,\n\nrespondent.\n\nFrancisco Dominguez, for petitioner.\n\nE.F. Johnson, respondent.\n\nARELLANO,\n\nC.J.\n\n:\n\nThe plaintiff has appealed against an order overruling a demurrer in a criminal case and asks that an injunction be issued restraining the judge below from continuing the proceedings until this court passes upon the action of\n\nmandamus\n\nbrought against him. The order in question not being appealable under section 24 of the General Orders, No. 58, series of 1900, there is nothing which can prevent the continuation of the case.\n\nThe application for an injunction is therefore denied, with costs.\n\nTorres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa, and Ladd, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
