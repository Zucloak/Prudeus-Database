No. L-1896\tDecember 23, 1904\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\nplaintiff-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nPEDRO TRINCIO,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nEugenio de Lara for appellant.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.\n\nJOHNSON,\n\nJ.:\n\nThis case came before the court on a motion by the Solicitor-General to dismiss the appeal for the reason that it had not been perfected within the time prescribed by section 47 of General Orders, No. 58.\n\nSection 47 of General Orders, No. 58, provides: \"An appeal must be taken within fifteen days from the rendition of the judgment or order appealed from.\"\n\nThe judgment appealed from was rendered by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila on the 17th day of August, 1903.\n\nOn the 19th day of August, 1903, the defendant and appellant presented a motion for a new trial.\n\nOn the 2nd of October, 1903, the judge who rendered the sentence in said cause denied the motion for a new trial, for the reason that the motion had not complied with the requirements of section 42 of General Orders, No. 58.\n\nOn the 5th day of October, 1903, the defendant and appellant filed with the said Court of First Instance his notice of appeal. The judgment was rendered on the 17th day of August, 1903. The appeal was taken on the 5th day of October, 1903. More than fifteen days had elapsed from the rendition of the judgment appealed from and the time the appeal was taken.\n\nThis court has decided in two different cases (United States\n\nvs.\n\nFlemister, 1 Phil. Rep., 317; United States\n\nvs.\n\nPerez, 1 Phil. Rep., 322) that the pendency of a motion for a new trial does not extend the time for taking an appeal beyond the fifteen days after the judgment provided for in the above-quoted section 47.\n\nBy the said decisions in the causes of the United States\n\nvs.\n\nFlemister and the United States\n\nvs.\n\nPerez, the following rules are established:\n\n(1)\tThat appeals in criminal cases will not be allowed after the lapse of fifteen days from the rendition of the judgment or order appealed from.\n\n(2)\tThat the pendency of a motion for a new trial does not extend the time to perfect an appeal.\n\n(3)\tThat the motion for a new trial fails,\n\nipso facto\n\n, if the judge neglects or fails to decide the same within the said fifteen days.\n\nThe motion to dismiss said appeal is hereby granted.\n\nArellano, C.J, Torres, Mapa and Carson, JJ., concur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
