ZAMORA, AS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY; COMMISSION ON AUDIT; ROBERTO AVENTAJADO, AS PRESIDENTIAL CONSULTANT ON COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS/ECONOMIC AFFAIRS; ANGELITO C. BANAYO, AS PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR/ON POLITICAL AFFAIRS; VERONICA IGNACIO-JONES, AS PRESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT/ APPOINTMENT SECRETARY (IN CHARGE OF APPOINTMENTS), RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N GONZAGA-REYES, J.: In this petition for prohibition and mandamus filed on December 9, 1999, petitioner Ramon A. Gonzales, in his capacity as a citizen and taxpayer, assails the constitutionality of the creation of the Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform (PCCR) and of the positions of presidential consultants, advisers and assistants. Petitioner asks this Court to enjoin the PCCR and the presidential consultants, advisers and assistants from acting as such, and to enjoin Executive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora from enforcing their advice and recommendations. In addition, petitioner seeks to enjoin the Commission on Audit from passing in audit expenditures for the PCCR and the presidential consultants, advisers and assistants. Finally, petitioner prays for an order compelling respondent Zamora to furnish petitioner with information on certain matters. On January 28, 2000, respondent Hon. Andres R. Narvasa, impleaded in his capacity as Chairman of the PCCR, filed his Comment to the Petition. The rest of the respondents, who are being represented in this case by the Solicitor General, filed their Comment with this Court on March 7, 2000. Petitioner then filed a Consolidated Reply on April 24, 2000, whereupon this case was considered submitted for decision. I. Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform The Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform (PCCR) was created by President Estrada on November 26, 1998 by virtue of Executive Order No. 43 (E.O. No. 43) in order âto study and recommend proposed amendments and/or revisions to the 1987 Constitution, and the manner of implementing the same.â[1] Petitioner disputes the constitutionality of the PCCR on two grounds. First, he contends that it is a public office which only the legislature can create by way of a law.[2] Secondly, petitioner asserts that by creating such a body the President is intervening in a process from which he is totally excluded by the Constitution â the amendment of the fundamental charter.[3] It is alleged by respondents that, with respect to the PCCR, this case has become moot and academic. We agree. An action is considered âmootâ when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead.[4] Under E.O. No. 43, the PCCR was instructed to complete its task on or before June 30, 1999.[5] However, on February 19, 1999, the President issued Executive Order No. 70 (E.O. No. 70), which extended the time frame for the completion of the commissionâs work, viz â SECTION 6. Section 8 is hereby amended to read as follows: Time Frame. The Commission shall commence its work on 01 January 1999 and complete the same on or before 31 December 1999. The Commission shall submit its report and recommendations to the President within fifteen (15) working days from 31 December 1999. The PCCR submitted its recommendations to the President on December 20, 1999 and was dissolved by the President on the same day. It had likewise spent the funds allotted to it.[6] Thus, the PCCR has ceased to exist, having lost its raison dâetre. Subsequent events have overtaken the petition and the Court has nothing left to resolve. The staleness of the issue before us is made more manifest by the impossibility of granting the relief prayed for by petitioner. Basically, petitioner asks this Court to enjoin the PCCR from acting as such.[7] Clearly, prohibition is an inappropriate remedy since the body sought to be enjoined no longer exists. It is well established that prohibition is a preventive remedy and does not lie to restrain an act that is already fait accompli.[8] At this point, any ruling regarding the PCCR would simply be in the nature of an advisory opinion, which is definitely beyond the permissible scope of judicial power. In addition to the mootness of the issue, petitionerâs lack of standing constitutes another obstacle to the successful invocation of judicial power insofar as the PCCR is concerned. The question in standing is whether a party has âalleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.â[9] In assailing the constitutionality of E.O. Nos. 43 and 70, petitioner asserts his interest as a citizen and taxpayer.[10] A citizen acquires standing only if he can establish that he has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the allegedly illegal conduct of the government; the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable action.[11] In Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Morato,[12] we denied standing to petitioners who were assailing a lease agreement between the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office and the Philippine Gaming Management Corporation, stating that, â¦ in Valmonte v. Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, G.R. No. 78716, Sept. 22, 1987, standing was denied to a petitioner who sought to declare a form of lottery known as Instant Sweepstakes invalid because, as the Court held, Valmonte brings the suit as a citizen, lawyer, taxpayer and father of three (3) minor children. But nowhere in his petition does petitioner claim that his rights and privileges as a lawyer or citizen have been directly and personally injured by the operation of the Instant Sweepstakes. The interest of the person assailing the constitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal. He must be able to show, not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has sustained or in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way. It must appear that the person complaining has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute complained of. We apprehend no difference between the petitioner in Valmonte and the present petitioners. Petitioners do not in fact show what particularized interest they have for bringing this suit. It does not detract from the high regard for petitioners as civic leaders to say that their interest falls short of that required to maintain an action under Rule 3, d 2. Coming now to the instant case, petitioner has not shown that he has sustained or is in danger of sustaining any personal injury attributable to the creation of the PCCR. If at all, it is only Congress, not petitioner, which can claim any âinjuryâ in this case since, according to petitioner, the President has encroached upon the legislatureâs powers to create a public office and to propose amendments to the Charter by forming the PCCR. Petitioner has sustained no direct, or even any indirect, injury. Neither does he claim that his rights or privileges have been or are in danger of being violated, nor that he shall be subjected to any penalties or burdens as a result of the PCCRâs activities. Clearly, petitioner has failed to establish his locus standi so as to enable him to seek judicial redress as a citizen. A taxpayer is deemed to have the standing to raise a constitutional issue when it is established that public funds have been disbursed in alleged contravention of the law or the Constitution.[13], Thus payerâs action is properly brought only when there is an exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power.[14] This was our ruling in a recent case wherein petitioners Telecommunications and Broadcast Attorneys of the Philippines (TELEBAP) and GMA Network, Inc. questioned the validity of section 92 of B.P. No. 881 (otherwise knows as the âOmnibus Election Codeâ) requiring radio and television stations to give free air time to the Commission on Elections during the campaign period.[15] The Court held that petitioner TELEBAP did not have any interest as a taxpayer since the assailed law did not involve the taxing or spending power of Congress.[16] Many other rulings have premised the grant or denial of standing to taxpayers upon whether or not the case involved a disbursement of public funds by the legislature. In Sanidad v. Commission on Elections,[17] the petitioners therein were allowed to bring a taxpayersâ suit to question several presidential decrees promulgated by then President Marcos in his legislative capacity calling for a national referendum, with the Court explaining that â ...[i]t is now an ancient rule that the valid source of a statute â Presidential Decrees are of such nature â may be contested by one who will sustain a direct injury as a result of its enforcement. At the instance of taxpayers, laws providing for the disbursement of public funds may be enjoined, upon the theory that the expenditure of public funds by an officer of the State for the purpose of executing an unconstitutional act constitutes a misapplication of such funds. The breadth of Presidential Decree No. 991 carries an appropriation of Five Million Pesos for the effective implementation of its purposes. Presidential Decree No. 1031 appropriates the sum of Eight Million Pesos to carry out its provisions. The interest of the aforenamed petitioners as taxpayers in the lawful expenditure of these amounts of public money sufficiently clothes them with that personality to litigate the validity of the Decrees appropriating said funds. â¦ In still another case, the Court held that petitioners â the Philippine Constitution Association, Inc., a non-profit civic organization - had standing as taxpayers to question the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 3836 insofar as it provides for retirement gratuity and commutation of vacation and sick leaves to Senators and Representatives and to the elective officials of both houses of Congress.[18] And in Pascual v. Secretary of Public Works,[19] the Court allowed petitioner to maintain a taxpayerâs suit assailing the constitutional soundness of Republic Act No. 920 appropriating P85,000 for the construction, repair and improvement of feeder roads within private property. All these cases involved the disbursement of public funds by means of a law. Meanwhile, in Bugnay Construction and Development Corporation v. Laron,[20] the Court declared that the trial court was wrong in allowing respondent Ravanzo to bring an action for injunction in his capacity as a taxpayer in order to question the legality of the contract of lease covering the public market entered into between the City of Dagupan and petitioner. The Court declared that Ravanzo did not possess the requisite standing to bring such taxpayerâs suit since â[o]n its face, and there is no evidence to the contrary, the lease contract entered into between petitioner and the City shows that no public funds have been or will be used in the construction of the market building.â Coming now to the instant case, it is readily apparent that there is no exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power. The PCCR was created by the President by virtue of E.O. No. 43, as amended by E.O. No. 70. Under section 7 of E.O. No. 43, the amount of P3 million is âappropriatedâ for its operational expenses âto be sourced from the funds of the Office of the President.â The relevant provision states - Appropriations. The initial amount of Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00) is hereby appropriated for the operational expenses of the Commission to be sourced from funds of the Office of the President, subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. Additional amounts shall be released to the Commission upon submission of requirements for expenditures. The appropriations for the PCCR were authorized by the President, not by Congress. In fact, there was no an appropriation at all. âIn a strict sense, appropriation has been defined âas nothing more than the legislative authorization prescribed by the Constitution that money may be paid out of the Treasuryâ, while appropriation made by law refers to âthe act of the legislature setting apart or assigning to a particular use a certain sum to be used in the payment of debt or dues from the State to its creditors.â â[21] The funds used for the PCCR were taken from funds intended for the Office of the President, in the exercise of the Chief Executiveâs power to transfer funds pursuant to section 25 (5) of article VI of the Constitution. In the final analysis, it must be stressed that the Court retains the power to decide whether or not it will entertain a taxpayerâs suit.[22] In the case at bar, there being no exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power, petitioner cannot be allowed to question the creation of the PCCR in his capacity as a taxpayer, but rather, he must establish that he has a âpersonal and substantial interest in the case and that he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of its enforcement.â[23] In other words, petitioner must show that he is a real party in interest - that he will stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment or that he will be entitled to the avails of the suit.[24] Nowhere in his pleadings does petitioner presume to make such a representation. II. Presidential Consultants, Advisers, Assistants The second issue raised by petitioner concerns the presidential consultants. Petitioner alleges that in 1995 and 1996, the President created seventy (70) positions in the Office of the President and appointed to said positions twenty (20) presidential consultants, twenty-two (22) presidential advisers, and twenty-eight (28) presidential assistants.[25] Petitioner asserts that, as in the case of the PCCR, the President does not have the power to create these positions.[26] Consistent with the abovementioned discussion on standing, petitioner does not have the personality to raise this issue before the Court. First of all, he has not proven that he has sustained or is in danger of sustaining any injury as a result of the appointment of such presidential advisers. Secondly, petitioner has not alleged the necessary facts so as to enable the Court to determine if he possesses a taxpayerâs interest in this particular issue. Unlike the PCCR which was created by virtue of an executive order, petitioner does not allege by what official act, whether it be by means of an executive order, administrative order, memorandum order, or otherwise, the President attempted to âcreateâ the positions of presidential advisers, consultants and assistants. Thus, it is unclear what act of the President petitioner is assailing. In support of his allegation, petitioner merely annexed a copy of the Philippine Government Directory (Annex âCâ) listing the names and positions of such presidential consultants, advisers and assistants to his petition. However, appointment is obviously not synonymous with creation. It would be improvident for this Court to entertain this issue given the insufficient nature of the allegations in the Petition. III. Right to Information Finally, petitioner asks us to issue a writ of mandamus ordering Executive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora to answer his letter (Annex âDâ) dated October 4, 1999 requesting for the names of executive officials holding multiple positions in government, copies of their appointments, and a list of the recipients of luxury vehicles seized by the Bureau of Customs and turned over to Malacanang.[27] The right to information is enshrined in Section 7 of the Bill of Rights which provides that â The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents, and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. Under both the 1973[28] and 1987 Constitution, this is a self-executory provision which can be invoked by any citizen before the courts. This was our ruling in Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission,[29] wherein the Court classified the right to information as a public right and âwhen a [m]andamus proceeding involves the assertion of a public right, the requirement of personal interest is satisfied by the mere fact that the petitioner is a citizen, and therefore, part of the general âpublicâ which possesses the right.â However, Congress may provide for reasonable conditions upon the access to information. Such limitations were embodied in Republic Act No. 6713, otherwise knows as the âCode of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees,â which took effect on March 25, 1989. This law provides that, in the performance of their duties, all public officials and employees are obliged to respond to letters sent by the public within fifteen (15) working days from receipt thereof and to ensure the accessibility of all public documents for inspection by the public within reasonable working hours, subject to the reasonable claims of confidentiality.[30] Elaborating on the significance of the right to information, the Court said in Baldoza v. Dimaano[31] that â[t]he incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a recognition of the fundamental role of free exchange of information in a democracy. There can be no realistic perception by the public of the nationâs problems, nor a meaningful democratic decisionmaking if they are denied access to information of general interest. Information is needed to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of the times.â The information to which the public is entitled to are those concerning âmatters of public concernâ, a term which âembrace[s] a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these directly affect their lives, or simply because such matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen. In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine in a case by case basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it relates to or affects the public.â[32] Thus, we agree with petitioner that respondent Zamora, in his official capacity as Executive Secretary, has a constitutional and statutory duty to answer petitionerâs letter dealing with matters which are unquestionably of public concern â that is, appointments made to public offices and the utilization of public property. With regard to petitionerâs request for copies of the appointment papers of certain officials, respondent Zamora is obliged to allow the inspection and copying of the same subject to the reasonable limitations required for the orderly conduct of official business.[33] WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed, with the exception that respondent Zamora is ordered to furnish petitioner with the information requested.

Gonzales, in his capacity as a citizen and \ntaxpayer, assails the constitutionality of the creation of the \nPreparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform (PCCR) and of the \npositions of presidential consultants, advisers and assistants. \nPetitioner asks this Court to enjoin the PCCR and the presidential \nconsultants, advisers and assistants from acting as such, and to enjoin \nExecutive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora from enforcing their advice and \nrecommendations. In addition, petitioner seeks to enjoin the Commission\n on Audit from passing in audit expenditures for the PCCR and the \npresidential consultants, advisers and assistants. Finally, petitioner \nprays for an order compelling respondent Zamora to furnish petitioner \nwith information on certain matters.\n\nOn January 28, 2000, respondent Hon. Andres R. Narvasa, impleaded\n in his capacity as Chairman of the PCCR, filed his Comment to the \nPetition. The rest of the respondents, who are being represented in this\n case by the Solicitor General, filed their Comment with this Court on \nMarch 7, 2000. Petitioner then filed a Consolidated Reply on April 24, \n2000, whereupon this case was considered submitted for decision.\n\nI. Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform\n\nThe Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform (PCCR) was \ncreated by President Estrada on November 26, 1998 by virtue of Executive\n Order No. 43 (E.O. No. 43) in order âto study and recommend proposed \namendments and/or revisions to the 1987 Constitution, and the manner of \nimplementing the same.â [1] Petitioner disputes the constitutionality of the PCCR on two grounds. \nFirst, he contends that it is a public office which only the legislature\n can create by way of a law. [2] Secondly, petitioner asserts that by creating such a body the President\n is intervening in a process from which he is totally excluded by the \nConstitution â the amendment of the fundamental charter.

We agree.\n\nAn action is considered âmootâ when it no longer presents a \njusticiable controversy because the issues involved have become academic\n or dead. [4] Under E.O. No. 43, the PCCR was instructed to complete its task on or before June 30, 1999. [5] However, on February 19, 1999, the President issued Executive Order No.\n 70 (E.O.

The \nCommission shall submit its report and recommendations to the President \nwithin fifteen (15) working days from 31 December 1999.\n\nThe PCCR submitted its recommendations to the President on December \n20, 1999 and was dissolved by the President on the same day. It had \nlikewise spent the funds allotted to it. [6] Thus, the PCCR has ceased to exist, having lost its raison dâetre . Subsequent events have overtaken the petition and the Court has nothing left to resolve.\n\nThe staleness of the issue before us is made more manifest by the\n impossibility of granting the relief prayed for by petitioner. \nBasically, petitioner asks this Court to enjoin the PCCR from acting as \nsuch. [7] Clearly, prohibition \nis an inappropriate remedy since the body sought to be enjoined no \nlonger exists. It is well established that prohibition is a preventive \nremedy and does not lie to restrain an act that is already fait accompli . [8] At this point, any ruling regarding the PCCR would simply be in the \nnature of an advisory opinion, which is definitely beyond the \npermissible scope of judicial power.\n\nIn addition to the mootness of the issue, petitionerâs lack of \nstanding constitutes another obstacle to the successful invocation of \njudicial power insofar as the PCCR is concerned.\n\nThe question in standing is whether a party has âalleged such a \npersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that \nconcrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon \nwhich the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult \nconstitutional questions.â [9] In assailing the constitutionality of E.O. Nos. 43 and 70, petitioner asserts his interest as a citizen and taxpayer. [10] A citizen acquires standing only if he can establish that he has \nsuffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the allegedly \nillegal conduct of the government; the injury is fairly traceable to the\n challenged action; and the injury is likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable action. [11] In Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Morato , [12] we denied standing to petitioners who were assailing a lease agreement \nbetween the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office and the Philippine \nGaming Management Corporation, stating that,\n\nâ¦ in Valmonte v. Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office , \nG.R. No. 78716, Sept. 22, 1987, standing was denied to a petitioner who \nsought to declare a form of lottery known as Instant Sweepstakes invalid\n because, as the Court held,\n\nValmonte brings the suit as a citizen, lawyer, taxpayer and \nfather of three (3) minor children. But nowhere in his petition does \npetitioner claim that his rights and privileges as a lawyer or citizen \nhave been directly and personally injured by the operation of the \nInstant Sweepstakes. The interest of the person assailing the \nconstitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal. He must be \nable to show, not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has \nsustained or in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a \nresult of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in \nsome indefinite way. It must appear that the person complaining has \nbeen or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is \nlawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or\n penalties by reason of the statute complained of.\n\nWe apprehend no difference between the petitioner in Valmonte and \nthe present petitioners. Petitioners do not in fact show what \nparticularized interest they have for bringing this suit. It does not \ndetract from the high regard for petitioners as civic leaders to say \nthat their interest falls short of that required to maintain an action \nunder Rule 3, d 2.\n\nComing now to the instant case, petitioner has not shown that he has \nsustained or is in danger of sustaining any personal injury attributable\n to the creation of the PCCR. If at all, it is only Congress, not \npetitioner, which can claim any âinjuryâ in this case since, according \nto petitioner, the President has encroached upon the legislatureâs \npowers to create a public office and to propose amendments to the \nCharter by forming the PCCR. Petitioner has sustained no direct, or \neven any indirect, injury. Neither does he claim that his rights or \nprivileges have been or are in danger of being violated, nor that he \nshall be subjected to any penalties or burdens as a result of the PCCRâs\n activities. Clearly, petitioner has failed to establish his locus standi so as to enable him to seek judicial redress as a citizen.\n\nA taxpayer is deemed to have the standing to raise a \nconstitutional issue when it is established that public funds have been \ndisbursed in alleged contravention of the law or the Constitution. [13] , Thus payerâs action is properly brought only when there is an exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power. [14] This was our ruling in a recent case wherein petitioners \nTelecommunications and Broadcast Attorneys of the Philippines (TELEBAP) \nand GMA Network, Inc. questioned the validity of section 92 of B.P. No. \n881 (otherwise knows as the âOmnibus Election Codeâ) requiring radio and\n television stations to give free air time to the Commission on \nElections during the campaign period. [15] The Court held that petitioner TELEBAP did not have any interest as a \ntaxpayer since the assailed law did not involve the taxing or spending \npower of Congress. [16]\n\nMany other rulings have premised the grant or denial of standing \nto taxpayers upon whether or not the case involved a disbursement of \npublic funds by the legislature. In Sanidad v. Commission on Elections , [17] the petitioners therein were allowed to bring a taxpayersâ suit to \nquestion several presidential decrees promulgated by then President \nMarcos in his legislative capacity calling for a national referendum, \nwith the Court explaining that â\n\n...[i]t is now an ancient rule that the valid source of a statute â\n Presidential Decrees are of such nature â may be contested by one who \nwill sustain a direct injury as a result of its enforcement. At the \ninstance of taxpayers, laws providing for the disbursement of public \nfunds may be enjoined, upon the theory that the expenditure of public \nfunds by an officer of the State for the purpose of executing an \nunconstitutional act constitutes a misapplication of such funds. The \nbreadth of Presidential Decree No. 991 carries an appropriation of Five \nMillion Pesos for the effective implementation of its purposes. \nPresidential Decree No. 1031 appropriates the sum of Eight Million Pesos\n to carry out its provisions. The interest of the aforenamed \npetitioners as taxpayers in the lawful expenditure of these amounts of \npublic money sufficiently clothes them with that personality to litigate\n the validity of the Decrees appropriating said funds. â¦\n\nIn still another case, the Court held that petitioners â the \nPhilippine Constitution Association, Inc., a non-profit civic \norganization - had standing as taxpayers to question the \nconstitutionality of Republic Act No. 3836 insofar as it provides for \nretirement gratuity and commutation of vacation and sick leaves to \nSenators and Representatives and to the elective officials of both \nhouses of Congress. [18] And in Pascual v. Secretary of Public Works , [19] the Court allowed petitioner to maintain a taxpayerâs suit assailing \nthe constitutional soundness of Republic Act No. 920 appropriating \nP85,000 for the construction, repair and improvement of feeder roads \nwithin private property. All these cases involved the disbursement of \npublic funds by means of a law.\n\nMeanwhile, in Bugnay Construction and Development Corporation v. Laron , [20] the Court declared that the trial court was wrong in allowing \nrespondent Ravanzo to bring an action for injunction in his capacity as a\n taxpayer in order to question the legality of the contract of lease \ncovering the public market entered into between the City of Dagupan and \npetitioner. The Court declared that Ravanzo did not possess the \nrequisite standing to bring such taxpayerâs suit since â[o]n its face, \nand there is no evidence to the contrary, the lease contract entered \ninto between petitioner and the City shows that no public funds have \nbeen or will be used in the construction of the market building.â\n\nComing now to the instant case, it is readily apparent that there\n is no exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power. The PCCR \nwas created by the President by virtue of E.O. No. 43, as amended by \nE.O. No. 70. Under section 7 of E.O. No. 43, the amount of P3 million is\n âappropriatedâ for its operational expenses âto be sourced from the \nfunds of the Office of the President.â The relevant provision states -\n\nAppropriations. The initial amount of Three Million Pesos \n(P3,000,000.00) is hereby appropriated for the operational expenses of \nthe Commission to be sourced from funds of the Office of the President, \nsubject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. \nAdditional amounts shall be released to the Commission upon submission \nof requirements for expenditures.\n\nThe appropriations for the PCCR were authorized by the President, not\n by Congress. In fact, there was no an appropriation at all. âIn a \nstrict sense, appropriation has been defined âas nothing more \nthan the legislative authorization prescribed by the Constitution that \nmoney may be paid out of the Treasuryâ, while appropriation made by law refers to âthe act of the legislature setting apart or assigning to a \nparticular use a certain sum to be used in the payment of debt or dues \nfrom the State to its creditors.â â [21] The funds used for the PCCR were taken from funds intended for the \nOffice of the President, in the exercise of the Chief Executiveâs power \nto transfer funds pursuant to section 25 (5) of article VI of the \nConstitution.\n\nIn the final analysis, it must be stressed that the Court retains\n the power to decide whether or not it will entertain a taxpayerâs suit. [22] In the case at bar, there being no exercise by Congress of its taxing \nor spending power, petitioner cannot be allowed to question the creation\n of the PCCR in his capacity as a taxpayer, but rather, he must \nestablish that he has a âpersonal and substantial interest in the case \nand that he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of \nits enforcement.â [23] In other\n words, petitioner must show that he is a real party in interest - that \nhe will stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment or that he will\n be entitled to the avails of the suit. [24] Nowhere in his pleadings does petitioner presume to make such a representation.\n\nII. Presidential Consultants, Advisers, Assistants\n\nThe second issue raised by petitioner concerns the presidential \nconsultants. Petitioner alleges that in 1995 and 1996, the President \ncreated seventy (70) positions in the Office of the President and \nappointed to said positions twenty (20) presidential consultants, \ntwenty-two (22) presidential advisers, and twenty-eight (28) \npresidential assistants. [25] Petitioner asserts that, as in the case of the PCCR, the President does not have the power to create these positions. [26]\n\nConsistent with the abovementioned discussion on standing, \npetitioner does not have the personality to raise this issue before the \nCourt. First of all, he has not proven that he has sustained or is in \ndanger of sustaining any injury as a result of the appointment of such \npresidential advisers. Secondly, petitioner has not alleged the \nnecessary facts so as to enable the Court to determine if he possesses a\n taxpayerâs interest in this particular issue. Unlike the PCCR which \nwas created by virtue of an executive order, petitioner does not allege \nby what official act, whether it be by means of an executive order, \nadministrative order, memorandum order, or otherwise, the President \nattempted to âcreateâ the positions of presidential advisers, \nconsultants and assistants. Thus, it is unclear what act of the \nPresident petitioner is assailing. In support of his allegation, \npetitioner merely annexed a copy of the Philippine Government Directory \n(Annex âCâ) listing the names and positions of such presidential \nconsultants, advisers and assistants to his petition. However, \nappointment is obviously not synonymous with creation. It would be \nimprovident for this Court to entertain this issue given the \ninsufficient nature of the allegations in the Petition.\n\nIII. Right to Information\n\nFinally, petitioner asks us to issue a writ of mandamus ordering \nExecutive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora to answer his letter (Annex âDâ) \ndated October 4, 1999 requesting for the names of executive officials \nholding multiple positions in government, copies of their appointments, \nand a list of the recipients of luxury vehicles seized by the Bureau of \nCustoms and turned over to Malacanang. [27]\n\nThe right to information is enshrined in Section 7 of the Bill of Rights which provides that â\n\nThe right of the people to information on matters of public concern\n shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents, and\n papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well\n as to government research data used as basis for policy development, \nshall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be \nprovided by law.\n\nUnder both the 1973 [28] and\n 1987 Constitution, this is a self-executory provision which can be \ninvoked by any citizen before the courts. This was our ruling in Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission , [29] wherein the Court classified the right to information as a public right\n and âwhen a [m]andamus proceeding involves the assertion of a public \nright, the requirement of personal interest is satisfied by the mere \nfact that the petitioner is a citizen, and therefore, part of the \ngeneral âpublicâ which possesses the right.â However, Congress may \nprovide for reasonable conditions upon the access to information. Such \nlimitations were embodied in Republic Act No. 6713, otherwise knows as \nthe âCode of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and \nEmployees,â which took effect on March 25, 1989. This law provides \nthat, in the performance of their duties, all public officials and \nemployees are obliged to respond to letters sent by the public within \nfifteen (15) working days from receipt thereof and to ensure the \naccessibility of all public documents for inspection by the public \nwithin reasonable working hours, subject to the reasonable claims of \nconfidentiality. [30]\n\nElaborating on the significance of the right to information, the Court said in Baldoza v. Dimaano [31] that â[t]he incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a \nrecognition of the fundamental role of free exchange of information in a\n democracy. There can be no realistic perception by the public of the \nnationâs problems, nor a meaningful democratic decisionmaking if they \nare denied access to information of general interest. Information is \nneeded to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of \nthe times.â The information to which the public is entitled to are those\n concerning âmatters of public concernâ, a term which âembrace[s] a \nbroad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either \nbecause these directly affect their lives, or simply because such \nmatters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen. In the \nfinal analysis, it is for the courts to determine in a case by case \nbasis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it \nrelates to or affects the public.â [32]\n\nThus, we agree with petitioner that respondent Zamora, in his \nofficial capacity as Executive Secretary, has a constitutional and \nstatutory duty to answer petitionerâs letter dealing with matters which \nare unquestionably of public concern â that is, appointments made to \npublic offices and the utilization of public property. With regard to \npetitionerâs request for copies of the appointment papers of certain \nofficials, respondent Zamora is obliged to allow the inspection and \ncopying of the same subject to the reasonable limitations required for \nthe orderly conduct of official business. [33]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is dismissed, with the \nexception that respondent Zamora is ordered to furnish petitioner with \nthe information requested.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Melo, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo, Buena, Ynares-Santiago , and De Leon, Jr., JJ. , concur.\n\nBellosillo, J. , abroad, on official business.\n\nPuno, J. , vote to dismiss on the ground that the case is moot.\n\n[1] E.O.
