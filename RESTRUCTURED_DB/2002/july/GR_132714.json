ROGELIO BARROZO Y CASTRO, APPELLANT.\n\nDECISION\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nThe failure of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the minority of the victim at the time the crime happened bars a conviction for rape in its qualified form.  Thus, the proper penalty is reclusion perpetua , not death.\n\nThe Case\n\nFor automatic review by this Court is the April 7, 1999 Decision [1] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Urdaneta City (Branch 46), acting as a Special Criminal Court in Criminal Cases U-9810 and U-9811.  The RTC found Rogelio Barrozo y Castro guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt and imposed on him the death penalty.  The decretal portion of the Decision reads:\nâWHEREFORE, finding ROGELIO BARROZO, in CRIM. CASE NO. U-9811, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of aggravated rape, an offense punishable under Art. 266-A, R.A. 8353, in relation to R.A. 7659, the Court sentences Rogelio Barrozo to suffer the penalty of DEATH, to be implemented in the manner provided by law; ordering the accused to indemnify Rowena Barrozo the sum of P75,000.00 for moral damages, further sum of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages and other accessory penalties of the law.\n\nâFor failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of Rogelio Barrozo beyond reasonable doubt in CRIM. CASE NO. U-9810, the Court ACQUITS said accused.â [2] Appellant was accused of raping his own daughter, Rowena Barrozo y Castro, in two separate Informations, [3] both dated October 14, 1998, which read as follows:\nCrim. Case No. U-9810\n\nâThat sometime in January, 1996, at Barangay Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his own daughter, Rowena Barrozo y Esteron, a minor below 12 years of age, against her will and to her damage and prejudice.â [4]\n\nCrim. Case No. U-9811\n\nâThat on or about August 16, 1998, between 12:00 oâclock midnight and 1:00 oâclock early dawn, at [B]arangay Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, threats, and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge with his own daughter, Rowena Barrozo y Esteron, a minor of 14 years of age, against her will and to her damage and prejudice.â [5] When arraigned on January 12, 1999, appellant, with the assistance of his counsel, [6] pled not guilty. [7] After pretrial and due trial, the RTC convicted him in Criminal Case No. U-9811, but acquitted him in Criminal Case No. U-9810.\n\nThe Facts\n\nVersion of the Prosecution\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General presents the prosecutionâs version of the facts in this wise:\nâRowena Barrozo, private complainant herein, testified that she was born in May 06, 1984.  She is the daughter of appellant, Rogelio Barrozo and one Magdalena Aquino.  Her parents were separated since she was a young girl.  Her mother, who now has her own family, left her in the company of her father, where they lived in the house of her uncle, Melecio Barrozo, at Barangay Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan.\n\nâOn the night of August 16, 1998, the victim who was then fourteen (14) years old, recounted that when she was in the room of their house at Barangay Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan, her father, appellant therein, undressed her and also undressed himself and laid beside her.  He covered her mouth and held her hands, went on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina; she felt pain.  Threatening to kill her if she files a complaint against him, appellant ran outside the house.  The victim jumped out of the window and went to the nearby house of her Auntie Remeng where she spent the night.  The following morning, she reported her ordeal to the Barangay Kagawad and the Barangay Captain, who however, did not believe her story.\n\nâThe victim proceeded to the house of her Aunt Lorie, who in turn brought her to her grandmother, Juliana Esteron, at Lelemaan, Manaoag, Pangasinan.  A woman named Leah Bumanlag, Chairman of the Manaoag Multi-Purpose Cooperative and Secretary of Disiplina Mass Media Action offered to help her and accompanied the victim to the Manaoag Police Station where they reported the rape.\n\nâDra. Mary Gwendolyn Luna, c/o Region I Medical Center, Dagupan City, medically examined Rowena Barrozo.  She (the doctor) testified further that the victim intimated to her that her father had abused her before, sometime in January 1996, when she was only twelve (12) years old.  Her findings were incorporated in the Medical Certificate she issued, the text of which reads:\nâMEDICO-LEGAL CERTIFICATE\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n- | Allegedly sexually abused by own father she was 12 years old\n- | Abuse was repeated August 16 (Sunday) 1998 at 10:00 A.M. in Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan\n- | Conscious, coherent, ambulatory, no signs of physical injuries\n- | Menarche â 12 years old\n | IMP-August 2ndweek 1998 â 4 days (August 15-18)\n- | Breast â with breast buds\n- | Genitalia â with healed lacerations at 5, 6 oâclock, vagina admits 1 finger with ease two fingers with slight difficulty and pain\n- | Cervix closed, uterus small, adnexae free whitish discharge\n- | Smear for presence of spermatozoa\n- | Vaginal smear result: Negative for spermatozoaââ[8](Citations omitted)\n[END_TABLE]\n\n- Allegedly sexually abused by own father she was 12 years old - Abuse was repeated August 16 (Sunday) 1998 at 10:00 A.M. in Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan - Conscious, coherent, ambulatory, no signs of physical injuries - Menarche â 12 years old IMP-August 2 nd week 1998 â 4 days (August 15-18) - Breast â with breast buds - Genitalia â with healed lacerations at 5, 6 oâclock, vagina admits 1 finger with ease two fingers with slight difficulty and pain - Cervix closed, uterus small, adnexae free whitish discharge - Smear for presence of spermatozoa - Vaginal smear result: Negative for spermatozoaââ [8] (Citations omitted) Version of the Defense\n\nAppellant, on the other hand, narrates his version of the facts as follows:\nâROGELIO BARROZO is the father of the complainant.  He testified that he was never married to complainantâs mother.  They separated when complainant was one year old.  He left their only daughter in the custody of his in-laws.  He said that complainant is mentally ill because he saw her burning her clothes for three times.  One time, he saw her pouring kerosene over cooked rice.\n\nâAccused-appellant denied having raped his daughter.  He said that it was only a âsolsolâ by the group of Jerry Cercado with whom he had a fight.  Jerryâs group instigated the filing of the rape case against him to eliminate him or as a revenge.  He belied that he had carnal knowledge with his daughter who was no longer living with him at the time of the alleged incident.  Prior to August 28, 1998, Rowena was living with del Rosario.  That was in June 1998.  He loved his daughter and wanted her to have good things in life.â [9] (Citations omitted) Ruling of the Trial Court\n\nIn convicting appellant of âaggravated rape,â the RTC gave full faith and credence to the testimony of complainant.  The trial judge ruled:\nâThe detailed and specific narration of Rowena, how she was sexually abused and assaulted by her father, prevailed over the timid denial and negative assertions of [appellant]. Denial can easily be fabricated and made. It cannot outweigh and prevail over the positive and clear assertions of Rowena of what transpired on  August 16, 1998 as their house at Mermer, Manaoag. The testimony of Rowena is most credible and to the mind of the Court, had actually happened to the exclusion of any other presumption.â [10] Hence, this automatic review. [11]\n\nThe Issues\n\nAppellant submits for our consideration the following alleged errors committed by the court a quo :\nâI\n\nThe trial court gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant notwithstanding the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nâII\n\nThe trial court gravely erred in not considering the defense interposed by accused-appellant.â [12] The Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe appeal is partly meritorious.  Because of the prosecutionâs failure to prove the victimâs minority when the rape was committed, reclusion perpetua -- not death -- is the proper penalty.\n\nFirst Issue:\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n\nAfter a thorough review of the records of the case, we are convinced that the RTC did not err in giving credence to the testimony of the victim and the other prosecution witnesses.\n\nIn a prosecution for rape, the Court is always guided by the following principles: (a) an accusation for rape can be made easily, but to disprove it can be difficult though the accused may be innocent; (b) in view of the nature of the crime which usually involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution  must stand or fall on its own merits and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. [13]\n\nThe testimony of the victim, narrating how she was raped by her own father on August 16, 1998, was clear and convincing.  It proceeded thus:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n | DIRECT EXAMINATION\n | \nFISCAL RESTITUTO A.

Rowena owed nothing to the Cercados for any favor. Rowena is too young to understand frame-up cases especially involving her own father. The Court is not swayed and persuaded that Rowena is being used to file these criminal charges against her own father on account of [the] instigation of other people.â [17] The court a quo likewise debunked appellantâs contention that the rape charge had been fabricated.  We disagree.  The allegation of incestuous rape is a serious matter.   Unless she is telling the truth, a girl would not concoct a story that would drag herself and her family to a lifetime of dishonor particularly when it could mean the death of her father. [18] For her to do so would go against human experience.\n\nMoreover, Rowenaâs testimony was partly corroborated by the other prosecution witnesses and the medicolegal expert, [19] who testified as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nâQ | What was your findings in your physical examination?\nA | I concentrated my findings on the genital area?\n | \nQ | You stated that you examined the genital area of the victim, what was your findings in the genital area?\nA | There was healed laceration in the hymenal area.\n | \nQ | In your findings, Doctora, it says: healed lacerations at 5 oâclock and 6 oâclock and vagina admits one finger with ease, two fingers with slight difficulty and pain, what do you mean by that Doctora, when you said slight difficulty and pain?\nA | An object penetrated the vaginal canal.\n | \nQ | You mean an object penetrated the canal which caused the laceration?\nA | I mean hard object.\n | \nQ | In your opinion, Doctora, is it possible that a human penis could have caused the lacerations at 5 oâclock and 6 oâclock positions?\n | \nATTY FLORENDO: The witness is incompetent to testify on that.

Q You mean an object penetrated the canal which caused the laceration?\nA I mean hard object. Q In your opinion, Doctora, is it possible that a human penis could have caused the lacerations at 5 oâclock and 6 oâclock positions? ATTY FLORENDO: The witness is incompetent to testify on that.

First , he did not present any medical certificate to validate this claim. Second , as can be gleaned from her testimony in court, Rowena was in complete command of her senses when she narrated how her father had raped her. Third , the contention of appellant that she worked as a housekeeper contradicted his contention that she was deranged.  Indeed, no one would hire or employ a person of unsound mind.\n\nThe denial of appellant cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the victim, who identified him as her ravisher. It is a hornbook doctrine that âa bare denial is a negative declaration which deserves no consideration and cannot prevail over the affirmative testimony of the victim which is corroborated by more evidence. It cannot survive the positive identification of the malefactor by the victim. Affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative one, especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness.â [21]\n\nFurther, in cases of incestuous rape, the Court usually gives more weight to the testimony of a young rape victim, especially a barrio lass like Rowena.  âNo woman would cry rape, undergo a public trial and relate the details of her defilement, unless motivated by her quest to right an injustice done to her.â [22]\n\nAs a general rule, the factual findings of the trial court will not be disturbed by an appellate court absent any clear showing that the lower court overlooked certain substantial and valuable facts which, if considered, might affect the outcome of the case.  The rationale for this principle is that the trial court is in a better position to observe the deportment or demeanor of witnesses firsthand. [23] Nothing in the present case warrants a deviation from this general rule.\n\nSecond Issue:\nProper Penalty\n\nThe prosecution was able to prove that appellant raped his daughter on August 16, 1998.  However, we believe that it failed to substantiate her minority.  â[T]he minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself. Otherwise, failure to sufficiently establish the victimâs age is fatal and consequently bars conviction for rape in its qualified form.â [24]\n\nCrucial to the imposition of rape in its qualified form is independent proof of minority such as the victimâs duly authenticated certificate of live birth [25] or baptismal certificate [26] or any other authentic document proving her age. [27] Because of this lapse, we have no other alternative but to hold appellant liable for simple rape only.\n\nWe also modify the award of damages. Consistent with current jurisprudence, [28] appellant should be made to pay P50,000 as civil indemnity for the rape committed.  Although the RTC correctly granted moral and exemplary damages to the victim, the amounts do not conform to existing jurisprudence. Moral damages are awarded to rape victims without need of specific proof because the mental, physical and psychological trauma suffered by them is already presumed from the fact of rape. [29] Likewise, the aggravating circumstance of relationship justifies the grant of exemplary damages, consistent with case law. [30]\n\nWHEREFORE, the automatically appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City (Branch 46) in Criminal Case No. U-9811 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the penalty of death is hereby reduced to reclusion perpetua .  Appellant is ordered to pay the victim the amounts of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages and P25,000 as exemplary damages.  No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez , and Corona, JJ. , concur.\nQuisumbing, J. , abroad on leave.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 21-35.  Written by Judge Modesto C.
