No. 1446            February 17, 1904\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\ncomplainant-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nAMBROSIO DE LA CRUZ,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nAmbrosio R. Bautista for appellant.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.\n\nJOHNSON,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe defendant in this case was charged with the crime of attempted rape.\n\nThe evidence discloses the fact that on the 20th of July, 1903, the accused went to the house where one Paula de los Santos lived, at about 8 o'clock at night, and entered the house without the permission of the said Paula. After the accused entered the house he took hold of her and threw her upon the floor. Paula at once cried for help. Her aunt was in the house with her at the time and saw the accused enter the house, but was afraid to go to her help when she heard her cries. One Apolinar Acosta, who lived in an adjoining house, hearing the cries of Paula, ran immediately to her aid. When Apolinar Acosta entered the house where Paula was he found the accused struggling with her, both being upon the floor. The mother of Paula, who was in an adjoining house, also heard the cries of her daughter, Paula, for help, on this same occasion.\n\nThe evidence shows that Paula was about 15 years of age and that the accused was about 16 years of age. The evidence further shows that the accused had visited the house of Paula before this night and desired to marry her.\n\nThe position in which the accused was found upon the floor with Paula by Apolinar Acosta at the time he, Apolinar Acosta, answered her cries, clearly indicates that the accused intended to commit the crime charged in the said complaint.\n\nThe judge of the Court of First Instance, after hearing the testimony, found the defendant guilty of the crime of attempted rape and sentenced him to be imprisoned for the term of two years and six months of\n\nprision correccional\n\n, with the costs.\n\nArticle 483 of the Penal Code provides that those who are found guilty of the crime of rape shall be punished with the penalty of\n\nreclusion temporal\n\n.\n\nArticle 66 of the Penal Code provides that those who shall be found guilty of an attempt to commit a crime shall be punished by the penalty two degrees lower that prescribed by law for the consummated crime.\n\nInasmuch as the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of the attempt to commit a crime only, then by virtue of article 66 of the said code, he should be punished with the penalty of\n\nprision correccional\n\n.\n\nThe evidence discloses the fact that the accused was but 16 years of age. Subsection 1 of article 85 of the said code provides that persons under 18 years of age and over 15 years of age shall be punished with the penalty one degree lower than that prescribed by law. By virtue of this last-quoted provision of the Penal Code, then, the penalty of\n\narresto mayor\n\nshould be imposed.\n\nThe offense was committed at nighttime. This should be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance.\n\nThere being no extenuating circumstances and one aggravating circumstance, the court must impose the maximum degree by virtue of subsection 3 of article 81 of the Penal Code. Therefore, by virtue of the foregoing provisions of the law and facts, the court does hereby modify the sentence of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal and does hereby sentence the accused, Ambrosio de la Cruz, to six months of arresto mayor and to pay the costs of both instances.\n\nArellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and McDonough, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
