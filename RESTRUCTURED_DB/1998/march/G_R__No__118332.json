Nos. 120620-21, March 20, 1998 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. CIRILO BALMORIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. CIRILO BALMORIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nRape may be\nproven by the credible and unbiased testimony of the offended party. In this case, such testimony is confirmed by\nthe sister of the appellant and corroborated by medico-legal findings. Hence, the conscience of the Court rests\neasy in affirming the conviction of the appellant for the rape of his two young\ndaughters.\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is an\nappeal from the Decision [1] dated December 15, 1994 of the\nRegional Trial Court of San Juan, Southern Leyte, Branch 26, in Criminal Case\nNos. 1089 and 1090, convicting Cirilo\nBalmoria of two counts of rape inflicted on his two daughters, Marissa and\nLorena.\n\nTwo\nInformations, [2] both dated September 2, 1993, were\nfiled by Provincial Prosecutor II Andres G. Yu, Jr. against appellant. In Criminal Case No. 1089, the Information\nreads: âThat on or about the 28th day of\nJanuary, 1991 at around 7:30 oâclock in the evening, more or less, in Barangay\nSug-angon, St. Bernard, Southern Leyte, Philippines, and within the\njurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lustful\nintent and lewd design, by means of deceit, force and intimidation and taking\nadvantage of the confidence afforded by the offended party, Marissa G.\nBalmoria, to him as a father, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously made her lay down on the copra drier house locally known as\nâtapahan,â and had sexual intercourse with her against her will, thereby\nresulting to the loss of her virginity, to the damage and prejudice of the said\nvictim and her family. CONTRARY TO LAW.â\n\nThe Information\nin Criminal Case No. 1090, on the other hand, states: âThat on or about the 29th day of\nJanuary, 1991 at around 12:00 oâclock noon, more or less, in Barangay\nSug-angon, St. Bernard, Southern Leyte, Philippines, and within the\njurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lustful\nintent and lewd design, by means of deceit, force and intimidation and taking\nadvantage of the confidence afforded by the offended party, Lorena G. Balmoria,\nto him as a father, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously\nmade her lay down on the floor, and had sexual intercourse with her against her\nwill, thereby resulting to the loss of her virginity, to the damage and\nprejudice of the said victim and her family. CONTRARY TO LAWâ\n\nUpon\narraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges. The two cases were tried jointly and, on\nDecember 15, 1994, the trial court\npromulgated the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: âWHEREFORE, the foregoing premises\nconsidered, the court hereby finds the accused guilty beyond all reasonable\ndoubt of the crime of RAPE in Criminal Case No. 1089 and hereby sentences him\nto suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to indemnify the\nvictim Marissa G. Balmoria the sum of P 50,000.00. In Criminal Case No. 1090, the\ncourt also finds the accused guilty beyond all reasonable doubt of the crime of\nRAPE and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and\nto indemnify the victim Lorena G. Balmoria the sum of P 50,000.00. The court in imposing the maximum\npenalty for the crime charged has taken into consideration the aggravating\ncircumstance of relationship. Considering the seriousness of the\npenalty herein meted out, the Officer\nin-Charge of the Sub-Provincial Jail, San Juan, Southern Leyte, is hereby\nordered to immediately transport the accused to Abuyog Penitentiary, Abuyog,\nLeyte, as precautionary measure against breaking jail. Costs against the accused. SO ORDERED.â [3]\n\nHence, this\nappeal. [4]\n\nThe Facts Version of the Prosecution\n\nThe\nprosecutionâs version of the facts is narrated by the trial court as follows: [5] âLorena G. Balmoria testified that\nshe [was] no longer going to school[,] and at the time of the assault upon her\nhonor by the accused, she was only 8 years old. At the time of the trial, she was already 11 years old. The\nincident happened on January 29, 1991, at around 12:00 oâclock noon. Lorena testified that at that particular time\nin their small house at BRGY. Sug-angon, St. Bernard, Southern Leyte, while her\nelder sister, Marissa[,] and brother were sent by her father and herein accused\nto grind palay, she was raped by her father, Cirilo Balmoria, the accused\nherein. She alleged that at the time of her rape, her mother was already out of\ntheir house to seek employment in Manila. She was alone with the accused.\nLorena further testified that the accused made her lie down. Their house is\njust a one-room affair [sic] structure. Then she was told to remove her\npanty. When she refused to obey the\norder, the accused forcibly removed her panty. Then the accused who also\nremoved his pants, mounted on her. Then he inserted his male organ into her\nvagina. Because she felt terrible pain, she cried and the accused slapped her\nface and told her to shut up. Lorena\nfurther alleged that her father-accused made push and pull movement with his\norgan and shortly thereafter, she noticed blood and some whitish substance\ncoming out of her vagina. Her father told her not to reveal what he did to her\nor else, he will kill her and her sister, brother and mother with the use of a\nsmall bolo used in stripping abaca locally known as âtuksi.â The accused according to Lorena is usually\ndrunk and whenever he is drunk, he would abuse her. Lorena testified that she was raped twice. She further testified\nthat she saw her father also raping her elder sister, Marissa, in their house.\nTheir house has no partition and all of them are sleeping in the same room,\nalso used as living and dining room. Lorena further testified that\nsometime in May 1993, when her father went to Bukidnon and she and Marissa and\nher brother stayed with her auntie, Ana Gallamos, she revealed to her aunt the\nhorrible experience she had in the hands of her father who repeatedly raped her\nand Marissa. Testifying also for the\nprosecution, Marissa G. Balmoria alleged that she is the private offended party\nin Criminal Case No. 1089, for Rape, which she filed against her own father.\nShe testified that she was 13 years old at the time of the trial and was 10\nyears old at the time the rape first took place on January 28, 1991, at about\n7:30 oâclock in the evening. Marissa testified that on January 28, 1991, at\nabout 7:30 oâclock in the evening, while she was inside their house, her\nfather, accused Cirilo Balmoria, who was in their yard, called her and asked\nher to accompany him towards the copra drier as he was going to defecate. When\nthey reached the copra drier, âtapahanâ in local dialect, she was made to lie\ndown. Marissa further alleged that when\nshe was already lying down on top of the drier, she was ordered by her father\nto remove her panty. When she refused to do so, he himself removed it and he\nthen removed also his short pants and got on top of her. Then her father\ninserted his male organ inside her vagina and she felt terrible pain. She\nshouted and cried but her father slapped her face and told her to shut up. After he had made his push and pull\nmovements, Marissa alleged that she saw blood and some whitish substance come\nout from her vagina. He further told her not to tell anyone about this incident\notherwise, he will kill her and her family with a very sharp bolo used to strip\nabaca locally known as âTuksi.â Marissa\nknows her father always to be drunk and violent, so, for fear of her life and\nthat of her family, she kept silent about what had been done to her by her\nfather. Marissa further testified that\nshe had been ravished by her father for at least six (6) times more, until\nsometime in May 1993. Marissa also alleged that she also witnessed her father\nraping her younger sister, Lorena. The prosecution presented another\nwitness, Ana Gallamos. Gallamos testified that she is the younger sister of the\naccused, Cirilo Balmoria, and they are immediate neighbors in Brgy. Sug-angon,\nSt. Bernard, Southern Leyte. Sometime in the month of May, 1993, sometime in\nthe morning while she was fixing her fence, she heard Marissa, her niece\nshouting and crying, saying âKill me, father, if you want, because I can no\nlonger hold onâ (âTay, patya na lang ko, dili na ko maka-antosâ). When she heard this, she repaired to the\nhouse of her brother, Cirilo Balmoria and she saw that only the accused and\nMarissa were there inside and she saw the accused zippering up his pants and\nMarissa very pale and crying. Gallamos did not dare confront the accused as she\nknows that he is always drunk and violent. She was afraid of him. Gallamos further alleged that after that\nincident, the accused would not give her a chance to be with his children. But\nwhen the house of the accused was burned and he left for Bukidnon, she took the\nchildren to her house and she inquired from Marissa why she was shouting and\ncrying and asking her father to just kill her as she could not hold on anymore,\nMarissa revealed that she was raped by her father and had been repeatedly raped\nsince January 28, 1991. Lorena also revealed to Gallamos her ordeal of being\nsexually abused by her father since January 29, 1991. Both Marissa and Lorena\nconfided to Gallamos that they were sometimes raped by their father one after the other inside their house. Upon\nhearing this information, she brought the victims to Anahawan District\nHospital, Anahawan, Southern Leyte, for medical examination. They were examined\nby Dr. Gil Nanquil, Medical Officer III of the said hospital. Testifying for the prosecution, Dr.\nGil Nanquil, Medical Officer III of the Anahawan District Hospital, Anahawan,\nSouthern Leyte, alleged that on June 9, 1993, he performed pelvic examination\non Marissa G. Balmoria and Lorena G. Balmoria, whose aunt requested that they\nbe examined for they are rape victims. For Marissa G. Balmoria, he found âpositive\nhealed laceration at 11 oâclock.â For Lorena G. Balmoria, he found âpositive\nhealed laceration at 4 oâclock and 8 oâclock.â Dr. Nanquil alleged that he had\nconducted several medico-legal cases already in the past and as such, he is\nqualified as expert witness. The accused did not object to his qualifications\nas expert witness to testify on his findings on the victims.â [6]\n\nVersion of the Defense\n\nClaiming denial\nand alibi, appellant views the facts as follows: âCirilo Balmoria testified that on\nJanuary 28, 1991 he worked in the abaca farm of his father and finished working\nat about 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon after which he dropped by at his house\nand changed his wet clothes. At that\ntime his two daughters, Lorena and Marissa [,] did not yet arrive. After changing his clothes, he proceeded to\nthe house of his father and delivered abaca and there at [sic] bought some\ndrinks. They engaged in drinking spree\ntogether with Enroy Eduarte and Gerardo Carcasona until 7:00 oâclock in the\nevening. Thereafter, Gerardo Carcasona\ninvited him to catch frogs at the stream in the irrigation canal. They were able to catch frogs and shrimps\nabout one half net bag until 9:00 oâclock in the evening. They went directly to the house of Gerardo\nCarcasona where they skinned and cooked the frogs. He went home past 10:00\noâclock in the evening. On January 29, 1991, he likewise\nworked in the abaca farm of his father together with the latter, Enroy Eduarte\nand Gerardo Carcasona. They started\ncleaning the farm after breakfast and finished cleaning at about 4:00 oâclock\nin the afternoon. From 7:00 oâclock in\nthe morning up to 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon he was in the farm of his\nfather. He took his lunch there. He declared that his daughter Lorena and\nMarissa were attending classes at Tambis Elementary School, a few kilometers\naway from their residence. His\ndaughters took their lunch in school. He further declared that he could\nnot rape his own children because they are his own blood and the rape charges\nagainst him are all lies and fabrication as his children could be mad at him\nbecause he usually punish [sic] them for failure to attend classes and instead\nthey go to the stream to take a bath.â [7]\n\nThe Issues\n\nAppellant\nsubmits the following assignment of errors: [8]\n\nâI The trial court gravely erred in\ngiving full weight and credence to the inconsistent and improbable testimonies\nof the private complainants Marissa Balmoria and Lorena Balmoria.\n\nII The trial court gravely erred in\nconsidering extraneous statements/matters not testified to by the prosecution\nwitnesses during the trial.\n\nIII The trial court gravely erred in\nfinding accused-appellant Cirilo Balmoria guilty of two counts of rape despite\nthe insufficiency of the evidence for the prosecution that would warrant a\nconviction beyond reasonable doubt.â\n\nSimply put,\nappellant questions the sufficiency of the prosecutionâs evidence to prove his\nguilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThis Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe appeal is\ncompletely bereft of merit.\n\nSufficiency of Prosecutionâs Evidence Credibility of\nWitnesses\n\nIn reviewing\nrape cases, this Court has always been guided by the following principles: (a)\nan accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but\nmore difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) in\nview of the intrinsic nature of the crime which usually involves only two\npersons, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme\ncaution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own\nmerits; it cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence\nfor the defense. [9] Thus, courts scrupulously examine the testimony of the complainant,\nbearing in mind that the conviction of the accused depends heavily on the\ncredibility of the offended woman. [10]\n\nAs a rule,\nappellate courts will not disturb the findings of the trial court on the\ncredibility of witnesses, for the trial court is in a better position to decide\nthe question. [11] However, this doctrine will not\napply in this instance, because the judge who penned the assailed Decision,\nJose H. Mijares, did not personally hear the evidence for the prosecution and\nthe defense. [12] It was Judge Leonardo T. Loyao who\nheard the testimony of the witnesses in this case. Accordingly, this Court waded through the entire records of the\ncase and stringently examined the testimonies of the witnesses.\n\nAfter a thorough\nreview of the said records, we find no reason to disturb the findings of the\ntrial court that the two victims, Marissa and Lorena, âcandidly, positively and\ncategorically testified as to their harrowing experience and their testimonies\ndeserve utmost weight and credit.â [13] Not only did they testify\nconvincingly that they -- before reaching the age of twelve -- had been\nsexually assaulted by their father against their will; they also emphatically\nstated that each of them witnessed the rape perpetrated against the other. The salient portion of Lorenaâs testimony is\nreproduced below: âQ Why\nis your father in court now? A He raped. Q Who\nwas raped by your father? A I,\nsir, and my elder sister.

PROSECUTOR YU: Q Did\nhe make a push-and-pull movement on top of you? x x x A Yes,\nsir.â [14]\n\nMarissa\nBalmoriaâs testimony is equally straightforward and convincing, viz. : âQ What\ndid he do to you while you were there at the âtapahanâ? A He\nmade me lie down. PROSECUTOR YU: Q Where? A On\nthe floor of the copra drier. Q And\nthen what did he do to you? A He\nordered me to take off my panty. Q Did\nyou remove your panty yourself?

A I\ndo not know how long was that but he actually hurt me.â [15]\n\nTheir stories\nwere corroborated by the testimony of their aunt, Ana Gallamos, who is the\nsister of the appellant. Gallamos\ntestified: âPROSECUTOR YU: Q Mrs.\nGallamos, why are you here in this court now? A To\ntestify regarding the rape committed to my nieces. Q Who\n[sic] are the names of your nieces? A Marissa\nand Lorena. Q The\naccused in this case, do you know him personally? A Yes,\nsir, I know him. Q Point\nhim out if he is inside the courtroom. A (The\nperson pointed to by the witness stood up and when asked of his identity,\nanswered that he is Cirilo Balmoria.) Q What\nis he to you? A He\nis my brother. Q You\nsaid that you are here to testify regarding the rape committed by your brother\nto your nieces, what is that that you are going to testify? A I\nam to testify here regarding the shouts that I heard from my niece sometime in\nMay, 1993 when I heard her shouted [sic] âTay, Tay, you just kill me because I\ncan no longer resist.â Q What\ndid you do upon hearing the shouts of your niece? A I\nwent to the house where the shouts came from because my house is just near\ntheir house and when I arrived [in] their house, I saw my brother pulling up the zipper of his trousers. PROSECUTOR YU: Q What\ndid you do upon seeing your brother? A At\nthat time, because of fear, I did not manifest or confront him but when his\nhouse was burnt and he went to Bukidnon, I invited my two nieces to sleep with me\nin my house. I investigated them as to what happened and they admitted that\nthey were raped by their father for quite a long time already. Q What\ndid you do upon learning from your two nieces that they were being raped by\nyour brother? A I\nbrought them to the Anahawan hospital to have them examined by Dr. Nanquil. PROSECUTOR YU: Q And\nwhat did you learn? A The\nfinding of Dr. Nanquil after examination revealed that the children were\nactually raped. Q Why\ndid you not confront your brother regarding the allegations made by your nieces\nto you? A Because\nI was afraid. Q Why? A I\nwas afraid because he is a troublemaker.â [16]\n\nAppellantâs Attacks on Complainantâs Credibility\n\nThe defense\nargues that the complainantsâ testimonies âcontradict human nature and experience.â [17] Appellant asserts that rape, being\na crime so detestable, would indelibly leave imprints on the mind of the\nravished, such that she would remember the exact date, month and year it\nhappened, which was not the case with Lorena.\n\nWe are not\npersuaded. This Court has repeatedly\nruled that âthe workings of the human mind, placed under a great deal of\nemotional and psychological stress (such as during rape), are unpredictable,\nand different people react differently. There is no standard form of behavioral\nresponse when one is confronted with a strange, startling, frightful or\ntraumatic experience - some may shout, some may faint, and some may be shocked\ninto insensibility.â [18] A rape victim cannot be expected to\nconstantly recount her experience. Because a victim would rather relegate the memory of her ravishment to\nthe recesses of her mind, she is\nconstantly engaged in an uphill battle to forget the torment of such a\ntraumatic event. The argument of the\ndefense is rendered more puerile, considering that it was the victimâs father\nwho committed the crime; thus, a ten-year-old child cannot be expected to\nimmediately think of redress and vindication. Put differently, the details appellant found wanting do not negate the\ntestimonies of the victims that they were raped by their father.\n\nOther\nallegations of the appellant impugning the credibility of both victims hardly\ndeserve comment. The defense argues that it was impossible for appellant to\nremove his pants while lying on top of Lorena. However, appellant has\nnot demonstrated or alleged any circumstance to substantiate his claim. Common experience teaches that the act of\nremoving oneâs pants while on top of another person is possible. The accused has not shown any reason why his\narms, elbows and knees could not maneuver in such position.\n\nThe defense\nlikewise contends that it was improbable for Lorena to have seen a whitish\nsubstance coming out of appellantâs penis. Again, such contention is\nincorrect. She testified that the\nwhitish substance trickled down from her vagina into her thighs, which\ntestimony is credible and backed by common experience.\n\nAlso, the claim\nof Marissa that she saw the penis of her father is not incompatible with her\nstatement that it was dark then. The\nyard where the crime was committed was not shown to be pitch-black, such that\nabsolutely nothing inside could be seen. It is sufficient that she saw the outline of what was inserted into her\nvagina and she recognized it as part of the anatomy of her father.\n\nLikewise, we\nfind that the defense erred in asserting that the natural reaction of Marissa\nupon seeing blood from her vagina should have been âto panic or [to] seek assistance.â [19] The sight of blood does not always\ngalvanize one into a state of hysteria or frenzy. Sometimes it leaves people dazed and dumbfounded, as was\nprobably the mental state of herein victim, Marissa. Indeed, we reiterate that different people react differently to\nstartling circumstances.\n\nFinally, the\ndefense assails the credibility of the prosecution witnesses by arguing that,\nsince the house where the rape happened was a one-room structure with no\npartition, it was improbable for the appellant to commit such a dastardly act\nin the presence of the other children. People\nv. Dabon [20] refutes the argument, for the Court there acknowledged that âit is a matter of\njudicial acceptance that rape can be committed even in places where people\ncongregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, and even\ninside a house where there are other occupants. Lust is no respecter of time\nand place.â In fact, it is of record\nthat both private complainants, who are sisters, were not only victims of their\nfatherâs perversity; they were also eyewitnesses of each otherâs shame and\nhorror.\n\nExtraneous Evidence Immaterial in This Case\n\nIt is further\nalleged by the defense that the trial court utilized pieces of evidence that\nwere foreign and extraneous to the records. In respect of Lorena Balmoriaâs testimony, the trial court found: âThat her father told her not to\nreveal what he did to her or else, he will kill her and her sister, brother and\nmother with the use of a small bolo used in stripping abaca locally known as\nâtuksi.â [21]\n\nIn the case of\nMarissa, these were the findings of the trial court: âx x x After he made his push and\npull movements, Marissa alleged that she saw blood and some whitish substance come out from her vagina. He further\ntold her not to tell any one about this incident otherwise, he will kill her,\nher family with a very sharp bolo used to strip abaca locally called âtuksi.â\nMarissa knows her father always to be drunk and violent, so, for fear of her\nlife and that of her family, she kept silent about what had been done to her by\nher father. Marissa further testified that she had been ravished by her father\nfor at least six (6) times more until sometime in May, 1993. Marissa also\nalleged that she witnessed her father raping her younger sister, Lorena.â [22]\n\nIt is true that\nthese alleged statements of both private complainants about being threatened\nwith a tuksi were not reflected in the records. However, the conviction of the accused did\nnot rest on these extraneous findings and imprudent statements of the trial\ncourt. Rather, it was firmly anchored\non the credible testimonies of the two victims. âWhat is important is the\nvictimâs testimony that the accused sexually abused her. When a victim says\nthat she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that\nrape has been committed and if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the\naccused may be convicted on the basis thereof.â [23]\n\nIn this case,\nboth Lorena and Marissa were unequivocal and unswerving in identifying\nappellant as the author of the two incidents of rape. Their testimonies were straightforward, detailed, and consistent\non all material points. Hence, we\nbelieve them.\n\nAppellantâs Defense of Alibi Debunked\n\nIn support of\nhis alibi, appellant alleges that on January 28, 1991, he worked in the abaca\nfarm of his father until four oâclock in the afternoon, after which he dropped\nby his house to change his wet clothing. As his daughters were allegedly not yet home then, he proceeded to his\nfatherâs house and engaged in a drinking spree with his friend Gerardo\nCarcasona beyond ten oâclock in the evening. Thus, he avers that he could not have\nraped Marissa at seven-thirty in the evening of that day since he was not home\nat that time.\n\nHe likewise\nclaimed that on January 29, 1991, he worked in the abaca farm of his father\nuntil four oâclock in the afternoon and did not come home for lunch. He stated that his daughters took their\nlunch in their school; therefore, he could not have raped Lorena at noontime of\nthat fateful day.\n\nWe are not\nconvinced. âCourts have always looked\nupon the defense of alibi with suspicion and have always received it with\ncaution not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but because it is\neasily fabricated. For alibi to serve as basis for acquittal, it must be\nestablished with clear and convincing evidence. The requisites of time and place must be strictly met. Appellant must convincingly demonstrate that\nit was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at\nthe time of its commission.â [24]\n\nAppellant herein\nhas not substantiated his claim of alibi with clear and convincing\nevidence. No other witness was\npresented to corroborate his alibi on either occasion. Gerardo Carcasona, who was his alleged\ndrinking partner on January 28, 1991 and who could have buttressed his nebulous\nclaim, did not take the witness stand. Neither did appellant present his father to testify that he was indeed\nworking in the farm at the time and date mentioned. Appellant himself failed to prove the distance between the farm\nand the house where the crime was committed. Clearly, the defense utterly failed to show that it was physically\nimpossible for appellant to have been at the locus criminis at the time\nof the alleged crime.\n\nIn any event,\nthe defense of alibi must fail in view of the positive identification of the\naccused by the victims, Lorena and Marissa. The rule is that affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative\none, especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness. [25] In this case, the credibility of\nboth witnesses has been positively established.\n\nNo False Accusation of Rape\n\nAppellant would have us believe that he was accused of rape\nby his daughters, because they were mad at him for punishing them whenever they\nfailed to attend classes. He also alleged that his own sister supported the\naccusation of his daughters because they were estranged. The absurdity of such contention is beyond\nbelief. âFamily relations are not so\neasily imperiled, with the father at risk of being imprisoned for banal and\nflimsy reasons, such as that alleged by the accused.â [26] Furthermore, âit is difficult to imagine\nthat a young girl would undergo the indignities and difficulties concomitant to\na prosecution for rape unless motivated by a desire to have the offender\napprehended and punished. The\nembarrassment and stigma alone of allowing an examination of her private parts\nand testifying at a public trial on the painfully intimate details of her\nviolation practically rules out the possibility of a false accusation of rape.â [27]\n\nCrime Committed\n\nThe trial court\nconvicted appellant of statutory rape under Art. 335, par. 3 of the Revised\nPenal Code. [28] We do not agree. The two Informations in this case did not\nallege statutory rape but rape âby means of deceit, force and intimidation and\ntaking advantage of the confidence afforded by the offended party, xxx, to him\nas a father.â Nonetheless, we hold\nappellant liable for rape as alleged in said Informations, i.e .,\ncommitted by use of force and intimidation on the two victims, under Art. 335,\npar. 1, of the said Code. As earlier\nstated, the evidence clearly shows that appellant employed force in raping his\ntwo daughters. [29] In any event, the Court has held\nthat âeven if there was no violence or force employed against [the daughter],\nthe moral influence of accused-appellant [father] over [his daughter] sufficed\nto make the crime rape,â [30] particularly in this case where the\nvictims were only 8 and 10 years of age, respectively, at the time they were\nviolated.\n\nIn the light of\nthe foregoing, this Courtâs conscience rests easy on the moral certainty that\nAppellant Cirilo Balmoria has been proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the\ncrime charged.\n\nPenalties\n\nThe trial court\ncorrectly awarded civil indemnity in the amount of P 50,000 per victim,\nan award which is automatically granted to the offended party without need of\nfurther evidence other than the fact of the commission of rape. [31] The trial court likewise correctly\nappreciated the alternative circumstance of relationship provided for in\nArticle 15 of the Revised Penal Code, considering that the offended parties\nwere appellantâs direct descendants. In\ncrimes against chastity, such as rape, relationship is aggravating. [32] However, this circumstance will not\naffect the penalty of reclusion perpetua because it is an indivisible\npenalty which, under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, must be applied\nregardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have\nattended the commission of the crime. [33]\n\nRA 7659 amended\nthe Revised Penal Code and, among others, prescribed the death penalty where\nthe rape victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is her father. The said amendatory law, however, cannot be\napplied in this case, inter alia , because the two incidents of crime\nwere perpetrated in January 1991, that is, before the effectivity of the said\nlaw.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal is hereby DENIED and\nthe appellant is CONVICTED of rape under Art. 335, par. 1, of the\nRevised Penal Code, but the penalties imposed by the trial court are AFFIRMED,\nas above discussed.\n\nSO ORDERED.
