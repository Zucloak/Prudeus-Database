  "title": "LILIA PASCUA, MIMI MACANLALAY, SUSAN C. DE CASTRO, VIOLETA M. SORIANO AND VICTORIA L. SANTOS, PETITIONERS, VS., NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (THIRD DIVISION) AND TIONGSAN SUPER BAZAAR, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: In granting this petition, the Court relies on the following doctrines: (1) where the conclusions of the NLRC and the labor arbiter are conflicting, this Court may review factual findings; (2) the employer has the burden of proof to show the validity of the dismissal; (3) a dismissal is deemed illegal unless the employer proves (a) just or authorized cause and (b) observance of due process; and (4) acceptance by the employee of separation pay does not estop him from alleging the illegality of his dismissal and from pressing for reinstatement. The Case This petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assails the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission[1] promulgated on April 29, 1995, and its Resolution[2] promulgated on September 19, 1995 denying petitionersâ motion for reconsideration in NLRC CA No. 007894-94,[3] both rendered in the consolidated cases for illegal dismissal filed by petitioners against respondents in the Regional Arbitration Branch of the Cordillera Administrative Region. The assailed Decision disposed as follows:[4] âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed decision of the Labor Arbiter, dated 30 September 1994 is hereby MODIFIED, as follows:ua (a) Complainant Lilia Pascua is declared to have voluntarily resigned; hence, the finding a quo of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of backwages and additional separation pay pertaining to her are hereby SET ASIDE; (b) Complainant Victoria Santos is found not to have been dismissed; hence, the finding a quo of illegal dismissal and the consequent award of backwages pertaining to her are hereby SET ASIDE. However, she is still entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, due to strained relationship; (c) Complainant Violeta Sorianoâs dismissal is declared to be for just cause; hence, the finding a quo of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of backwages and separation pay, as to her, are hereby SET ASIDE; (d) Complainant Susan de Castro is found not to have been dismissed; hence, the finding a quo of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of backwages, as to her, are hereby SET ASIDE. However, she is still entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement due to strained relationship, plus her unpaid salary. Other holdings in the appealed decision stand AFFIRMED.â On the other hand, the labor arbiterâs[5] disposition, dated September 30, 1994, reads:[6] âVIEWED FROM THIS LIGHT, judgment is hereby rendered with the following dispositions: 1.That the complainants were illegally dismissed. Considering however, that, reinstatement is no longer possible, because [of] the serious personal and physical differences between them, respondent, should pay the complainantsâ backwages and/or separation [pay] as follows: A. LILIA PASCUA P 126,696.52 (Backwages + separation pay) B. MIMI MACANLALAY 4,138.49 (Separation pay) C. VICTORIA SANTOS 123,038.18 (Backwages + separation pay) D. SUSAN DE CASTRO 118,874.52 (Backwages + separation pay) E. VIOLETA SORIANO 119,616.52; (Backwages + separation pay) PROVIDED, that, the payment of the backwages, shall be without prejudice to any adjustment, for the purpose of deducting, the complainantsâ earnings elsewhere during the pendency of the case; 2. That the claims for overtime pay, rest day premiums and service incentive leave pay are denied, considering the finding of the office of the Regional Director of DOLE-CAR, that respondent committed no violation in so far as general labor standards are concerned; and 3. That the claims for moral and exemplary damages as well as attorneyâs fees are denied for lack of proper basis.â The Facts The facts of the case, as narrated by the labor arbiter and quoted by the NLRC, are as follows:[7] âThe complainants are among the thirty seven (37) employees of Henry Lao at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar. On August 7, 1991, Henry Lao received a telephone call from a lady, who informed him, that, Lydia Navarette, one of his sales ladies had just stolen a âSanyo Karaokeâ, the previous night. Upon his receipt of the information, he immediately dispatched Luisita Lavarias and Lydia Navarette to the latterâs house and [sic] recover the stolen item. When the two (2) reached Navaretteâs house, she reasoned out, that, she did not have her keys. Thereafter, they returned to the bazaar. There, Lydia Navarette made a confession, that, there were others who were involved in the stealing of goods. Henry Lao, then called his other sales ladies for a confrontation. The first person that he called was a certain âNoemiâ, who in turn pointed to a certain Celia Lazo, as one of them. Gloria Garcia was the next person to be called. She likewise admitted her participation. When she said that she knew the persons involved in the pilferage or price cutting, she was required by Henry Lao to write down their names. Violeta Soriano and Susan Castillo were included in her list. The eighteen (18) sales ladies who admitted their guilt resigned. The remaining workers were placed under the watchful eyes of respondent. On August 21, 1991, Lilia Pascua was caught repairing three (3) pairs of pants, that allegedly was [sic] not bought at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar. The following day, she did not report for work anymore. Instead, she went to see the respondentâs bookkeeper and requested for the computation of her separation pay. On August 24, 1991, barely seventeen (17) days after the mass resignation of the 18 sales ladies, for various offenses, Victoria Santos was caught charging a meter of a cloth for the price of a yard. For this offense, she was suspended for a period of thirty (30) days. She never returned to work since then. Mimi Macanlalay and Violeta Soriano were previously assigned as cashiers. But because of their alleged acts of dishonesty, they were relieved from their positions. Mimi Macanlalay later on resigned. While Violeta Soriano was terminated on the ground of insubordination on December 11, 1991. xxx xxx xxx THE CASE OF LILIA PASCUA: Lilia Pascua was employed on June 2, 1985, as a saleslady. She is [sic] assigned at the pants section of [the] bazaar. She is [sic] a trusted employee of respondent. For a time, he relied on her (TSN, Henry Lao, February 7, 1994, p. 9) On September 21, 1991, she left her station unattended for about three (3) hours in the afternoon. At about the same time, respondent noticed Mrs. Manaois, roaming around the store without buying anything. Henry Lao closely watched her, because she was one of the people that were conniving with the sales ladies. At 6:00 oâ clock p.m. respondent saw Mrs. Manaois approach Lilia Pascua at the sewing machine. Lilia Pascua was finishing the last of the three (3) pairs of pants that belonged to Mrs. Manaois. (TSN, Henry Lao, February 4, 1994, p. 9) Respondent scolded Lilia Pascua for this offense, because it is against the respondentâs policy that repair jobs of items that are not bought at the bazaar, should not be accepted. She was given a warning, that this prohibition should be strictly followed. Lilia Pascua did not report for work the next day. She opted to resign. Respondent paid her separation pay. THE CASE OF MIMI MACANLALAY: Mimi Macanlalay was employed on June 10, 1989. Previously, she worked for Mrs. Tan. On September 19, 1991, Mrs. Tan went to the Tiongsan Super Bazaar, and she saw Mimi Macanlalay working as a cashier. Mrs. Tan informed Mr. Lao, that Mimi Macanlalay was previously dismissed by her for dishonesty. In relieving Ms. Macanlalay from her position as cashier, respondent ratiocinates: xxx xxx xxx âxxx (i)t is perfectly normal for Mr. Lao to be apprehensive when he was informed by his customer friend about the previous dismissal of complainant Macanlalay from her previous job for dishonesty. Considering the widescale underpricing pilferage and deceit which was discovered only a month earlier, Mr. Lao was naturally worried xxx.â âUpon the admission made by complainant, Mr. Lao, naturally had reason to doubt her honesty. This was the reason why he informed her, that she was returning her as sales lady.â (See Vol. II, pp. 114-115, records of Macanlalay v-Lao cases) Just like Lilia Pascua, Mimi Macanlalay resigned, and was paid her separation pay. THE CASE OF VICTORIA SANTOS: On August 24, 1991, Victoria Santos was caught charging a meter of a cloth for the price of a yard. Mr. Lao immediately called her, for an explanation. Her explanation was found by Mr. Lao to be unsatisfactory. She was suspended for thirty (30) days. THE CASE OF VIOLETA SORIANO: Violeta Soriano was employed on May 16, 1984. After the August 7, 1991 incident, she was assigned as a cashier. She was reverted back as a sales lady after a few weeks when Mr. Lao learned, that, she had some knowledge of the schemes of the resigned employees. On November 9, 1991, Mr. Lao required her to explain in writing, why she should not be the subject matter of a disciplinary action, for her failure to fill up her daily time record. Mr. Lao ordered another employee to put the phrase âno entryâ into Ms. Sorianoâs daily time record. Ms. Soriano attempted to grab the daily time record from its custodian. A commotion ensued, in the presence of many customers. She was suspended for thirty (30) days. Respondent reviewed her past records and found out that, she was the subject matter of a disciplinary action in the past. She was terminated [sic] on December 8, 1991. THE CASE OF SUSAN DE CASTRO Susan De Castro refused to receive her salary on November 18, 1991, because she insisted on receiving more than what is indicated in the payrolls. Respondent told her, that if she is [sic] not satisfied with her salary, she can [sic] find employment elsewhere. She failed to report for work on the following day. In any case, respondent states, that, she can be dismissed for lack of trust and confidence, for her involvement in the pilferage of goods.â Petitioners filed at the Regional Arbitration Branch of the NLRC[8] separate complaints against Henry Lao[9]for âillegal dismissal and claims for violation of labor standards pertaining to payment of wages.â[10] The parties submitted position papers and documentary evidence, and hearings were held. Subsequently, the labor arbiter ruled that the dismissals were illegal and awarded back wages and separation pay to petitioners. Both petitioners and respondent appealed to the NLRC, which modified the appealed decision. It found the termination of petitionersâ employment to be due either to voluntary resignation or dismissals with just cause; however, it awarded separation pay to Victoria Santos. Petitionersâ motion for reconsideration was unavailing. Hence, this petition which was deemed submitted for decision upon receipt by the Court of private respondentâs memorandum on October 22, 1997.[11] Respondent NLRCâs Ruling The NLRC ruled: âOn the bases of the foregoing, we find that the evidence on hand preponderates for the dismissal of complainant. There could be no better evidence other than the DTR itself. Granting that there was indeed an instruction in the past for the employees not to make regular entries in their DTRs the same should not be expediently used as a lame excuse for the employee who defies an order from management for him to now to make the proper entries. Management should not be taken hostage of [sic] its previous mistakes or apparent leniencies precluding it from instituting the necessary and needed reforms and punishing violators thereof. In the case at bar, there is no dispute that an order for the employees to make regular entries in their DTRs is lawful and that defiance thereof undoubtedly amounts to insubordination. Hence, complainantâs dismissal is justified under the premises. Besides, there is reasonable ground to believe that complainant had indeed left for overseas employment which explains why complainant was not able to testify on the witness stand during the trial of the case and refute the charges of management in this regard (TSN dated 07 February 1994, p. 8, Volume III, Records). Insofar as the payment of overtime pay is concerned it must be denied for lack of factual or legal basis. Under the premises, complainants failed to substantiate their entitlement to overtime pay by clear and convincing evidence. Unlike in ordering monetary claims whereby the burden of proof rests [on] the shoulders of the employer the same does not squarely apply in claims for overtime pay on the theory that an employee is presumed to have been engaged to render the regular or normal eight (8) hours of work per day. Besides, the mere fact that respondent committed no violation of labor standards laws per inspection report by the Inspector Division of the Regional office concerned, should work in his favor (p. 33, Volume I, Records). Anent the claim for moral and exemplary damages, suffice it to say, that even granting that the issue on sexual harassment implicating Mr. Henry Lao was sufficiently established, the award for said damages must still fail because the said ground relied upon by the complainants was neither the proximate nor contributory cause of their supposed dismissals. Finally, we need to stress that under Article III (a) of the Labor Code, as amended, attorneyâs fees are recoverable only against the culpable party in case of unlawful withholding of wages, a situation not obtaining in the case at bar.â[12] The Issues In their Memorandum,[13] petitioners present the following issues: âWhether or not Respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction 1. In reversing the finding of illegal dismissal of the labor arbiter who observed the demeanors of the witnesses during the trial on the merits and in supplanting its conflicting rulings which are contrary to law and settled jurisprudence. 2. In finding petitioners to have voluntarily resigned despite complete absence of any evidence of resignation and consequently in finding them as not illegally dismissed despite complete absence on [sic] evidence that private respondent complied with the termination guidelines as mandated in Article 277 (b) and Rule XIV, Book V of the Rules Implementing the Labor Code, thus making the questioned decision as not supported by evidence. 3. In not reinstating petitioners with full backwages and other benefits until actual reinstatement and in not granting their money claims for underpayment of wages, overtime pay and other benefits, claims for moral and exemplary damages and attorneyâs fees against private respondent Henry Lao who has been established as a sexual harasser.â At bottom, the resolution of this case hinges on this question: Were petitionersâ employment terminated because of resignation, abandonment or dismissal? The Courtâs Ruling The petition is meritorious. Main Issue: Abandonment, Resignation or Dismissal? Petitioners claim that they were denied due process. In the first place, they were not even served âa formal notice of dismissal.â In particular, the violation of procedural due process was manifested when Petitioner âMimi Macanlalay x x x was summarily discharged due to a mere say-so suspicion of dishonesty.â[14] Petitioners further allege that their dismissals were âoppressive and anti-social,â complaining that it was âoff-tangent and immaterialâ for private respondent to discuss the âtheft and price-cutting of some employees of respondent bazaar x x x because the offenses of some employees cannot be imputed against petitioners.â[15] Petitioners indignantly accuse the NLRC of being âbiased in favor of private respondent,â as shown when the Commission decreed the validity of their dismissals in the clear absence of evidence, and of issuing conflicting rulings to accommodate respondent employer.[16] Buttressing their contention, petitioners point out that the award of separation pay expressly to Victoria Santos and Susan de Castro and impliedly to Mimi Macanlalay[17] indicates that they were illegally dismissed because, if they were not, then they should not have been awarded any separation pay as was done to Lilia Pascua and Violeta Soriano.[18] Petitioners also allege that the NLRC abused its discretion when it ruled that they had been âvalidly dismissed and [that they] resigned voluntarily just because they received money from private respondent.â[19] Citing Molave Tours Corporation vs. NLRC, et al.,[20] they argue that since resignation must be made with the intent of relinquishing oneâs office, the filing of their complaints for illegal dismissal is âwholly incompatibleâ with private respondentâs assertion that they âvoluntarily resigned.â[21] Upholding public respondent, the solicitor general contends that Petitioners Lilia Pascua, Victoria Santos and Susan C. De Castro resigned from their jobs; that Mimi Macanlalay voluntarily left private respondentâs employ; and that Petitioner Violeta Soriano was dismissed for just cause. Private respondent, on the other hand, maintains the validity of the dismissal of the petitioners. It contends that the award of separation pay â[was] not inconsistent with the finding that there [was] no illegal dismissal since it was given by the employer as financial assistance.â[22] Private respondent also insists that Petitioner Pascua clearly violated the company rule âthat only pants bought from Tiongsan may be worked on by the employees x x x.â[23] She was not dismissed but âsimply did not report for work and instead demanded x x x separation pay.â[24] Petitioner Santos, on the other hand, âsimply did not report back to work after serving her thirty (30) days suspension. Instead, she asked private respondent to pay her separation pay computed at one (1) month pay for every year of service.â[25] Petitioner Soriano was first suspended for causing a âcommotion inside the store in the presence of customers.â Later, her employment was validly terminated.[26] Petitioner De Castro âshowed gross insubordination and hostility towards private respondent [Henry Lao].â Though it is true that the latter had âsuggested to her to look for employment elsewhere, this certainly did not amount to a termination.â[27] Lastly, Petitioner Macanlalay âresigned.â[28] Review of Evidence in Labor Cases As a rule, petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 involve only jurisdictional issues, or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Hence, this Court refrains from reviewing factual assessments of lower courts and agencies exercising adjudicative functions, such as the NLRC. Occasionally, however, this Court is constrained to wade into factual matters when there is insufficient or insubstantial evidence on record to support those factual findings; or when too much is concluded, inferred or deduced from the bare or incomplete facts appearing on record. In the present case, we find the need to review the records to determine the facts with certainty not only because of the foregoing inadequacies, but also because the NLRC and the labor arbiter have come up with conflicting positions.[29] In the present case, the central question is: Was petitionersâ employment terminated in accordance with law? After poring over the records and the evidence, as well as the applicable law and jurisprudence, the Court is convinced that the answer is âNo.â First. Basic is the doctrine that resignation must be voluntary and made with the intention of relinquishing the office, accompanied with an act of relinquishment.[30] Based on the evidence on record, we are more than convinced that Petitioners Lilia Pascua, Mimi Macanlalay, Susan C. De Castro and Violeta Soriano did not voluntarily quit their jobs. Rather, they were forced to resign or were summarily dismissed without just cause. Petitioners -- except Victoria L. Santos -- forthwith took steps to protest their layoff and thus cannot, by any logic, be said to have abandoned their work.[31] Second. In labor cases, the employer has the burden of proving that the dismissal was for a just cause; failure to show this, as in the instant case, would necessarily mean that the dismissal was unjustified and, therefore, illegal.[32] To allow an employer to dismiss an employee based on mere allegations and generalities would place the employee at the mercy of his employer; and the right to security of tenure, which this Court is bound to protect, would be unduly emasculated.[33] Considering the antecedents in the summary dismissals effected against Petitioners Pascua, Macanlalay, De Castro and Soriano, the causes asserted by private respondent are, at best, tenuous or conjectural; at worst, they are mere afterthoughts. Third. Under the Labor Code, as amended, the dismissal of an employee which the employer must validate has a twofold requirement: one is substantive, the other procedural. Not only must the dismissal be for a just or an authorized cause as provided by law (Articles 282, 283 and 284 of the Labor Code, as amended); the rudimentary requirements of due process -- the opportunity to be heard and to defend oneself -- must be observed as well.[34] Fourth. Petitioners Pascua and Macanlalayâs acceptance of separation pay did not necessarily amount to estoppel; nor did it connote a waiver of their right to press for reinstatement, considering that such acceptance -- particularly by Petitioner Pascua who had to feed her four children[35] -- was due to dire financial necessity. [36] Based on the above postulates, the facts and the law as they apply to each petitioner shall now be discussed. Petitioners Illegally Dismissed Lilia Pascua. According to the NLRC, after being caught repairing the last of three pairs of pants which were not bought at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar, Lilia Pascua admitted the wrongdoing to Henry Lao, explaining that she was merely accommodating a certain Mrs. Manaois, who was allegedly Laoâs friend. She averred:[37] â5. That at almost 6:30 oâ clock in the evening of August 21, 1991, a close friend of my employers whom I know as Ms. Manaois approached me and requested me to cut and sew the hem of her pants which I turned down; 6. That said Ms. Manaois however insisted that I work on her pants with the assurance that she will be the one to talk to my employers anyway she is their âkumadreâ such that with said assurance I started to put my line (âguhitâ) on the hem of the pants at which time, Henry Lao approached us and questioned my act;â Thereupon, she was scolded and suspended by Lao, after which, the NLRC found, she decided to resign from private respondentâs employ. We cannot accept the NLRCâs simplistic findings. The uncontested affidavit of Petitioner Pascua provides the evidence conveniently ignored by the NLRC, which shows the folly of the alleged resignation:[38] â7. That Henry Lao shouted at me and told me to go upstairs to the counter so that I can sign for my suspension and hurried me up by pushing me by my shoulders towards the direction of the counter and as soon as I was there, he hurriedly let me sign a blank paper and no copy was given to me; 8. That thereafter, Henry Lao kept pushing me by my shoulders as he repeatedly told me in a loud manner, âpakuwenta mo na ang separation pay mo at hindi ka na rin makakabalik. Puntahan mo ang accountant.â which made me nervous and afraid especially that he kept on pushing me even when I was already on top of the stairs; 9. That on August 22, 1991, as instructed by Henry Lao, I went to the accountant for the computation of my separation pay which she computed after which I went to Tiong San Super Bazaar where I was paid the computed separation pay of P8,010.;â (Emphasis supplied). It is evident from the above that, contrary to private respondentâs allegation, Petitioner Pascua was forced to resign -- an act which was tantamount to a dismissal, an illegal one at that. Was there any valid cause for her dismissal?[39] The solicitor general submits: âIt must be pointed out that Henry Lao was acting within his rights when he chastised and suspended petitioner for flagrant violation of company rules.â[40] We do not agree. To be a just cause for an employeeâs dismissal, wilful disobedience must show the following: the employeeâs assailed conduct must have been wilful or intentional, the wilfulness being characterized by a âwrongful and perverse attitudeâ; and the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee and pertinent to the duties which he or she had been engaged to discharge. In this light, not every case of so-called wilful disobedience by an employee can reasonably be penalized with dismissal.[41] In the present case, Petitioner Pascua was aware of the close relationship between Henry Lao and Mrs. Manaois. Indeed, Lao himself did not deny that he knew Manaois. Thus, Pascua feared that, if she turned down Mrs. Manaoisâ request, she would be subjected to public scolding by Lao. Thus, accommodation of the said request may have been an act of disobedience of her employerâs order, but hardly an instance of the âwrongful and perverse attitudeâ that would warrant a penalty as grave as dismissal. Fairness requires that dismissal, being the ultimate penalty that can be meted out to an employee, must have a clear basis.[42] Any ambiguity in the ground for the termination of an employee should be interpreted against the employer, who ordained such ground in the first place. Susan De Castro. Finding that she was ânot at all dismissed,â the NLRC, as well as the labor arbiter, ruled that Petitioner De Castro was âsimilarly situated as petitioner Santos.â We do not agree. First of all, the NLRC could not explain the contradictions in Petitioner De Castroâs case. If she had not been dismissed but was still an employee of private respondent, then why did she file this case for illegal dismissal? And even more perplexing: Why would the NLRC conclude that reinstatement was no longer possible because of the partiesâ ârespective imputations of charges against each otherâ? Furthermore, the labor arbiterâs finding that there was no evidence on record to establish her dismissal is refuted by these uncontested allegations of Petitioner De Castro:[43] â2. Complainant Susan de Castro, in Case No. -0377-91, was also a saleslady of the Tiongsan Super Bazaar from May 16, 1987 to November 19, 1991. She worked every day except Mondays, her restday [sic], in nine and a half hours (9 Â½) but she was required to fill up her daily time records reflecting eight (8) hours work only. Her wage rates were as follows: P40/day - May 16, 1987 to December 31/87 64/day - January/88 to September 30/89 89/day - October/89 to November 30, 1990 99/day - December 1/90 to April 30/91 106/day - May 1/91 to November 19, 1991. Complainant was not paid her legal benefits such as underpayment of basic wage, unpaid overtime pay, premiums for restday [sic] and holiday pay, incentive leave pay and 13th month pay differentials. That on November 19, 1991 she was dismissed summarily, whimsically and capriciously in this manner: When she filled up her daily time record correctly and demanded payment of her correct wage/overtime pay, respondent Henry Lao flared up and said: âHuwag ka ng pumasok? [sic] Suspended ka na! Antayin mo na lang ang sulat ko! You are excused, goodbye!â And she was not allowed to report for work anymore.â (Emphasis supplied). What further muddles the issue of dismissal is the grant of separation pay. The solicitor general contends that, since private respondent was not averse to giving separation pay to Petitioners Pascua and Macanlalay, it may also be required to pay separation pay to those employees who âleave its employ.â[44] The grant of separation pay, however, is inconsistent with existing employment or voluntary resignation, for it presupposes illegal dismissal.[45] The solicitor general rationalizes the award of separation pay as one that is based on âequitable consideration;â that is, it was for the purpose of providing petitioner the âwherewithal during the period that she is looking for another employment.â[46] This explanation is unacceptable. If petitioner was legally dismissed, as the solicitor general held, then the NLRC erred in finding her âentitled to separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement.â Indeed, if she was dismissed for cause, jurisprudence demands that she should not be granted any award for the wrongdoing she was alleged to have committed; nor is she entitled to reinstatement and back wages.[47] While this Court has allowed the grant of separation pay âas a measure of social justice,â settled is the rule that separation pay is allowed only in those instances in which the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those involving his moral character.[48] And certainly, the charge against de Castro -- falsifying her daily time records -- involves her moral character. Mimi Macanlalay. According to the NLRC, Petitioner Macanlalay âvoluntarily left private respondentâs employ.â The solicitor general, in turn, alleges that this is supported by the finding of the labor arbiter that she âlodged her complaint, because her separation pay [was] too little.â[49] The evidence on record negates resignation. Petitioner Macanlalay contends that, prior to her employment at Tiongsan Super Bazaar, she had been a saleslady at Rommelâs which was owned by a certain Mrs. Tan. On September 20, 1991, while she was working as a cashier at Tiongsan, Mrs. Tan saw her; thereupon, Mrs. Tan reported to Henry Lao that Petitioner Macanlalay had previously been dismissed for alleged dishonesty. Petitioner was then called by Lao and unceremoniously told: âKunin mo na ang separation pay mo. Pa total mo na sa accountant. At huwag ka ng magtrabajo dito.â[50] Clearly, she did not resign; she was orally dismissed by Lao. It is this lack of clear, valid and legal cause, not to mention due process, that made her dismissal illegal, warranting reinstatement and the award of back wages.[51] Violeta M. Soriano. The solicitor general contends that the two labor tribunals were correct in holding that Petitioner Soriano was âdismissed for just causes,â namely: (1) the omission of an entry in her daily time record and her attempt to prevent the writing of âno entryâ thereon; (2) her reservation of certain merchandise which she intended to purchase without informing the management; and (3) her absences without prior approval. Here, however, the solicitor general declares that private respondent is subject to sanction âfor its failure to accord Petitioner Soriano the right to an administrative investigation in conformity with the procedural requirements of due process.â[52] We do not agree with the solicitor general. The NLRC justified Petitioner Sorianoâs dismissal by alleging that it was due to her failure to make regular entries in her daily time records. We believe, however, that this alleged âjust causeâ was convincingly disputed by Petitioner Soriano in her letter dated November 9, 1991, which states:[53] âFirst, with respect to your finding that I have not been filling up my daily time record daily, I would like to remind you that you are the one who established said system or practice which is applicable to all employees in your establishment with specific instructions from you as to what working hours are supposed to be reflected therein which is limited to only eight (8) hours a day although I and the other employees regularly and normally render work beyond eight (8) hours daily. With such system, you do not expect me and my co-employees to do otherwise for fear of being charged by you for disobedience to your instructions and consequently be the subject of persistent harassments and unnecessary confrontations with you. In other words, if I and my co-employees have not been filling up our daily time record on a daily basis, it was more in accordance with your specific instructions. It is indeed a surprise to me why it is only now that you are seemingly making a big issue out of a system that you yourself has [sic] created and this time in a way that is against me when I do not have anything to do with said system that you imposed on me and co-employees. Besides, this is what I had been doing from the time I was employed in your establishment to November 07, 1991 [in] accordance with your instructions. It would seem however that you instructed Dasig to fill up my daily time record by placing therein âno entryâ for the blank spaces provided for November 3 to 7, 1991, inclusive, which I asked her to sign but she refused to do so. Likewise, you verbally told me today that I had to leave the premises at 5:30 p.m. and to work for only eight (8) hours which I did not do considering that this would be a sudden change of my regular working hours. x x xâ The labor arbiter sustained Petitioner Sorianoâs explanation, holding thus:[54] âVioleta Soriano, was first relieved from her position as cashier, after the August 7, 1991 incident. On October 9, 1991, she executed an affidavit attesting that, the workers at Tiongsan Super Bazaar were underpaid. (See Vol. I, p. 53, record of Lilia Pascua) According to the respondent, after she was relieved from her position, she refused to perform the task, that, she had been previously doing. When she was confronted by Mr. Lao, why she was behaving that way, she flared up. Due to this, she was issued a memorandum for insubordination. (See Vol. II, p. 157, record of Macanlalay, et al. cases) Another memorandum was issued on November 8, 1991, directing her to explain why she had not been filling up her daily time records. (See Vol. II, p. 86) A notice of preventive suspension was issued to her on November 10, 1991. (See Vol. II, p. 89) And, finally a notice of dismissal dated December 8, 1991. (See Vol. II, p. 90) Complainant believes that these series of memoranda, were issued by respondent only after he failed to convince her to retract her statement that she executed in favor of Lilia Pascua. (See Vol. II, p. 63, record of Macanlalay, et al. v- Henry Lao) The respondentâs decision to dismiss is hazy. It does not contain any findings of fact, and the basis for the imposition of the penalty. As evidenced by the records, there should have been no basis for the issuance of the notice of preventive suspension that was issued on November 10, 1991. Granting, that, it is true that, complainant refused to receive on November 8, 1991, (see Vol. II, p. 86) she submitted her explanation on November 10, 1991, at 8:30 a.m. (See p. 88, ibid) There is likewise no basis for the accusation that complainant made an unauthorized change in her lunch break. (See p. 89, ibid) Respondent himself confirmed that his salesladies were free to arrange among themselves their time. (TSN, Henry Lao, February 10, 1994, p. 40) xxx xxx xxx It has been held, that, the employer is possessed with an inherent right to dismiss an employee for loss of confidence. The Court has a plethora of decisions that supports and recognizes this authority of the employer to sever its relationship with the employee involving such cases. However, loss of confidence as a valid cause to terminate an employee must nonetheless rest on an actual breach of duty committed by the employee and not on the employerâs imagined whim or caprice. The employerâs evidence must clearly and convincingly establish the facts and incidents upon which the loss of confidence in the employee may fairly be made to rest. (Estiva v- NLRC, 22 SCRA 169, other citations omitted) The respondent failed to establish the bases for the complainantsâ dismissal. They were illegally dismissed.â (Emphasis supplied). To find a convenient justification to dismiss an employee, Henry Lao cannot unilaterally change the previous rule -- irregular as it may have been -- regarding entries in daily time records without first informing petitioners, particularly Soriano, of such change. True, an employee may be validly dismissed for violation of a reasonable company rule or regulation adopted for the conduct of the companyâs business. It is equally true, however, that company policies and regulations are generally valid and binding on the parties and must be complied with until finally revised or amended by competent authority.[55] It is settled, too, that -- in order that an employer may terminate the services of an employee on the ground of wilful disobedience of the formerâs orders, regulations or instructions -- it must be established that the said orders, regulations, or instructions are (1) reasonable and lawful, (2) sufficiently known to the employee, and (3) connected with the duties which the employee has been engaged to discharge.[56] Petitioner Santos Resigned We agree that Petitioner Santos voluntarily resigned. The labor arbiter did not find Petitioner Santos [or Petitioner De Castro] to have been illegally dismissed:[57] âRespondent states, that, Victoria Santos and Susan de Castro were not dismissed, but if they reported back, Mr. Lao, had valid grounds to dismiss them. Except for the sweeping accusations, there is no evidence on record to support their dismissal. Therefore, this Labor Arbiter is not in a position to declare that complainants Santos and De Castro have forfeited their employment with respondent.â Likewise, the NLRC ruled that Victoria L. Santos was not dismissed. Rather, after her suspension for âcharging for a meter of cloth bought [at] the price of a yard,â[58] she offered to resign. The solicitor general supports this by stating that âeven the Labor Arbiter discovered this when he ruled that âthere [was] no evidence on record to support their [Santosâ and De Castroâs] dismissal.ââ[59] Notwithstanding his assertion that Petitioner Santos had resigned, the solicitor general sustained the award of separation pay to her, because she had a âright to return to private respondent bazaar,â which she could have exercised if not for her âstrained relationshipâ[60] with its owner. Petitioner Santos contends that the affidavit she executed on October 9, 1991 caused her illegal summary dismissal.[61] As correctly found by the NLRC, this allegation defies logic, because Petitioner Santos was dismissed on September 25, 1991, that is, prior to the execution of said affidavit. Damages and Attorneyâs Fees Moral damages are recoverable where the dismissal of the employee was attended by bad faith or constituted an act oppressive to labor or was done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy.[62] Although the Labor Code is silent on the liability of an employer for damages in case the termination of employment is declared to be unjust, we have ruled,[63] however, that the employer may be so liable if, in terminating the employment, it also committed an antisocial and oppressive abuse of its right to investigate and dismiss its employee in violation of Article 1701 of the Civil Code.[64] Thus, in CLLC E.G. Gochangco Workers Union vs. NLRC,[65] we said: âAs for moral damages, we hold the said respondent liable therefor under the provisions of Article 2220 of the Civil Code providing for damages for âbreaches of contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.â We deem just and proper the sum of P5,000.00 each in favor of the terminated workers, in the concept of such damages.â In cases involving breaches of contracts, moral damages may also be awarded where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.[66] Good faith refers to a state of mind, which is manifested by the acts of the individual concerned. It consists of an intention to abstain from taking an unconscionable and unscrupulous advantage of another.[67] Henry Laoâs dismissals of petitioners, except Santos who resigned, was marked by precipitate dispatch and utter disregard of due process. Clearly, Lao abused his position as an employer. It is well-settled that, for dismissals to be valid, not only must employers show sufficient ground therefor, but must also prove that they observed procedural due process by giving their employees two notices -- first, of the intention to dismiss, indicating therein their acts or omissions complained against; and, second, of the decision to dismiss â and, in between such notices, an opportunity for them to answer and rebut the charges against them.[68] In the present case, not only was private respondentâs dismissal of petitioners without just cause; it was also without procedural due process. Attorneyâs fees may likewise be awarded, for concerned petitioners were dismissed in bad faith.[69] Petitioner Pascua was summarily dismissed. Petitioner De Castro was also dismissed without due process after she demanded to be paid her correct wages as mandated by labor laws. Petitioner Soriano, in spite of her explanation in answer to the capricious charges raised by Henry Lao, was still summarily dismissed. Attorneyâs fees may be awarded when petitioners, illegally dismissed in bad faith, are compelled to litigate or incur expenses to protect their rights by reason of the acts and the omissions of their employer.[70] WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED and the assailed Decision and Resolution are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioners Pascua, Macanlalay, De Castro and Soriano are FOUND to have been illegally dismissed. Private respondents are ORDERED to REINSTATE them immediately without loss of seniority rights and with full back wages and other benefits from the time of their illegal dismissal up to the time of their actual reinstatement,[71] but the amounts already paid to Petitioners Pascua and Macanlalay shall be deducted from the sums respectively due them. Each illegally dismissed petitioners is AWARDED P25,000 as moral damages plus ten percent of the total sum as and for attorneyâs fees. Having voluntarily resigned, Petitioner Santos is not entitled to the awards given to other petitioners. However, inasmuch as the private respondent did not appeal, it is bound by the NLRCâs disposition in regard to Santos.[72] No costs. SO ORDERED.

However,\nshe is still entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, due to\nstrained relationship; (c) Complainant\nVioleta Sorianoâs dismissal is declared to be for just cause; hence, the\nfinding a quo of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of\nbackwages and separation pay, as to her, are hereby SET ASIDE; (d) Complainant\nSusan de Castro is found not to have been dismissed; hence, the finding a\nquo of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of backwages, as to her,\nare hereby SET ASIDE.

Other holdings in the appealed\ndecision stand AFFIRMED.â\n\nOn the other\nhand, the labor arbiterâs [5] disposition, dated September 30,\n1994, reads: [6] âVIEWED FROM THIS LIGHT, judgment\nis hereby rendered with the following dispositions:\n\n1.That the complainants were illegally\ndismissed. Considering however, that,\nreinstatement is no longer possible, because [of] the serious personal and\nphysical differences between them, respondent, should pay the complainantsâ\nbackwages and/or separation [pay] as follows:\n\nA.

That the claims for overtime pay, rest day\npremiums and service incentive leave pay are denied, considering the finding of\nthe office of the Regional Director of DOLE-CAR, that respondent committed no\nviolation in so far as general labor standards are concerned; and\n\n3. That the claims for moral and exemplary damages as\nwell as attorneyâs fees are denied for lack of proper basis.â\n\nThe Facts\n\n[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]\n\nThe facts of the\ncase, as narrated by the labor arbiter and quoted by the NLRC, are as follows: [7] âThe complainants are among the\nthirty seven (37) employees of Henry Lao at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar. On August 7, 1991, Henry Lao received a\ntelephone call from a lady, who informed him, that, Lydia Navarette, one of his\nsales ladies had just stolen a âSanyo Karaokeâ, the previous night. Upon his receipt of the information, he\nimmediately dispatched Luisita Lavarias and Lydia Navarette to the latterâs\nhouse and [sic] recover the stolen\nitem. When the two (2) reached\nNavaretteâs house, she reasoned out, that, she did not have her keys. Thereafter, they returned to the\nbazaar. There, Lydia Navarette made a\nconfession, that, there were others who were involved in the stealing of\ngoods. Henry Lao, then called his other\nsales ladies for a confrontation. The\nfirst person that he called was a certain âNoemiâ, who in turn pointed to a\ncertain Celia Lazo, as one of them. Gloria Garcia was the next person to be called. She likewise admitted her participation. When she said that she knew the persons\ninvolved in the pilferage or price cutting, she was required by Henry Lao to\nwrite down their names. Violeta Soriano\nand Susan Castillo were included in her list. The eighteen (18) sales ladies who admitted their guilt resigned. The remaining workers were placed under the\nwatchful eyes of respondent. On August 21, 1991, Lilia Pascua\nwas caught repairing three (3) pairs of pants, that allegedly was [sic] not\nbought at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar. The following day, she did not report for work anymore. Instead, she went to see the respondentâs\nbookkeeper and requested for the computation of her separation pay. On August 24, 1991, barely\nseventeen (17) days after the mass resignation of the 18 sales ladies, for\nvarious offenses, Victoria Santos was caught charging a meter of a cloth for\nthe price of a yard. For this offense,\nshe was suspended for a period of thirty (30) days. She never returned to work since then. Mimi Macanlalay and Violeta Soriano\nwere previously assigned as cashiers. But because of their alleged acts of dishonesty, they were relieved from\ntheir positions. Mimi Macanlalay later\non resigned. While Violeta Soriano was\nterminated on the ground of insubordination on December 11, 1991. xxx xxx xxx THE CASE OF LILIA PASCUA: Lilia Pascua was employed on June\n2, 1985, as a saleslady. She is [sic]\nassigned at the pants section of [the] bazaar. She is [sic] a trusted employee of respondent. For a time, he relied on her (TSN, Henry Lao, February 7, 1994,\np. 9) On September 21, 1991, she left\nher station unattended for about three (3) hours in the afternoon. At about the same time, respondent noticed\nMrs. Manaois, roaming around the store without buying anything. Henry Lao closely watched her, because she\nwas one of the people that were conniving with the sales ladies. At 6:00 oâ clock p.m. respondent saw Mrs.\nManaois approach Lilia Pascua at the sewing machine. Lilia Pascua was finishing the last of the three (3) pairs of\npants that belonged to Mrs. Manaois. (TSN, Henry Lao, February 4, 1994, p. 9) Respondent scolded Lilia Pascua for\nthis offense, because it is against the respondentâs policy that repair jobs of\nitems that are not bought at the bazaar, should not be accepted. She was given a warning, that this\nprohibition should be strictly followed. Lilia Pascua did not report for work the next day. She opted to resign. Respondent paid her separation pay. THE CASE OF MIMI MACANLALAY: Mimi Macanlalay was employed on\nJune 10, 1989. Previously, she worked\nfor Mrs. Tan. On September 19, 1991,\nMrs. Tan went to the Tiongsan Super Bazaar, and she saw Mimi Macanlalay working\nas a cashier. Mrs. Tan informed Mr.\nLao, that Mimi Macanlalay was previously dismissed by her for dishonesty. In relieving Ms. Macanlalay from her\nposition as cashier, respondent ratiocinates: xxx xxx xxx\n\nâxxx (i)t is perfectly normal for\nMr. Lao to be apprehensive when he was informed by his customer friend about\nthe previous dismissal of complainant Macanlalay from her previous job for\ndishonesty. Considering the widescale\nunderpricing pilferage and deceit which was discovered only a month earlier,\nMr. Lao was naturally worried xxx.â\n\nâUpon the admission made by\ncomplainant, Mr. Lao, naturally had reason to doubt her honesty. This was the reason why he informed her,\nthat she was returning her as sales lady.â (See Vol. II, pp. 114-115, records of Macanlalay v-Lao cases) Just like Lilia Pascua, Mimi\nMacanlalay resigned, and was paid her separation pay. THE CASE OF VICTORIA SANTOS: On August 24, 1991, Victoria Santos\nwas caught charging a meter of a cloth for the price of a yard. Mr. Lao immediately called her, for an\nexplanation. Her explanation was found\nby Mr. Lao to be unsatisfactory. She\nwas suspended for thirty (30) days. THE CASE OF VIOLETA SORIANO: Violeta Soriano was employed on May\n16, 1984. After the August 7, 1991\nincident, she was assigned as a cashier. She was reverted back as a sales lady after a few weeks when Mr. Lao learned,\nthat, she had some knowledge of the schemes of the resigned employees. On November 9, 1991, Mr. Lao required her to\nexplain in writing, why she should not be the subject matter of a disciplinary action, for her failure to fill up her daily\ntime record. Mr. Lao ordered another\nemployee to put the phrase âno entryâ into Ms. Sorianoâs daily time\nrecord. Ms. Soriano attempted to grab\nthe daily time record from its custodian. A commotion ensued, in the presence of many customers. She was suspended for thirty (30) days. Respondent reviewed her past records and\nfound out that, she was the subject matter of a disciplinary action in the\npast. She was terminated [sic] on December\n8, 1991. THE CASE OF SUSAN DE CASTRO Susan De Castro refused to receive her\nsalary on November 18, 1991, because she insisted on receiving more than what\nis indicated in the payrolls. Respondent told her, that if she is [sic] not satisfied with her salary,\nshe can [sic] find employment elsewhere. She failed to report for work on the following day. In any case, respondent states, that, she\ncan be dismissed for lack of trust and confidence, for her involvement in the\npilferage of goods.â\n\nPetitioners\nfiled at the Regional Arbitration Branch of the NLRC [8] separate complaints against Henry\nLao [9] for âillegal dismissal and claims\nfor violation of labor standards pertaining to payment of wages.â [10] The parties submitted position\npapers and documentary evidence, and hearings were held. Subsequently, the labor arbiter ruled that\nthe dismissals were illegal and awarded back wages and separation pay to\npetitioners.\n\nBoth petitioners\nand respondent appealed to the NLRC, which modified the appealed\ndecision. It found the termination of\npetitionersâ employment to be due either to voluntary resignation or dismissals\nwith just cause; however, it awarded separation pay to Victoria Santos. Petitionersâ motion for reconsideration was\nunavailing. Hence, this petition which\nwas deemed submitted for decision upon receipt by the Court of private respondentâs\nmemorandum on October 22, 1997 . [11]\n\nRespondent NLRCâs Ruling\n\nThe NLRC ruled: âOn the bases of the foregoing, we\nfind that the evidence on hand preponderates for the dismissal of\ncomplainant. There could be no better\nevidence other than the DTR itself. Granting that there was indeed an instruction in the past for the\nemployees not to make regular entries in their DTRs the same should not be\nexpediently used as a lame excuse for the employee who defies an order from\nmanagement for him to now to make the proper entries. Management should not be taken hostage of [sic] its previous\nmistakes or apparent leniencies precluding it from instituting the necessary\nand needed reforms and punishing violators thereof. In the case at bar, there is no\ndispute that an order for the employees to make regular entries in their DTRs\nis lawful and that defiance thereof undoubtedly amounts to\ninsubordination. Hence, complainantâs\ndismissal is justified under the premises. Besides, there is reasonable ground\nto believe that complainant had indeed left for overseas employment which\nexplains why complainant was not able to testify on the witness stand during\nthe trial of the case and refute the charges of management in this regard (TSN\ndated 07 February 1994, p. 8, Volume III, Records). Insofar as the payment of overtime\npay is concerned it must be denied for lack of factual or legal basis. Under the premises, complainants failed to\nsubstantiate their entitlement to overtime pay by clear and convincing\nevidence. Unlike in ordering monetary\nclaims whereby the burden of proof rests [on] the shoulders of the employer the\nsame does not squarely apply in claims for overtime pay on the theory that an\nemployee is presumed to have been engaged to render the regular or normal eight\n(8) hours of work per day. Besides, the\nmere fact that respondent committed no violation of labor standards laws per\ninspection report by the Inspector Division of the Regional office concerned,\nshould work in his favor (p. 33, Volume I, Records). Anent the claim for moral and\nexemplary damages, suffice it to say, that even granting that the issue on\nsexual harassment implicating Mr. Henry Lao was sufficiently established, the\naward for said damages must still fail because the said ground relied upon by\nthe complainants was neither the proximate nor contributory cause of their\nsupposed dismissals. Finally, we need\nto stress that under Article III (a) of the Labor Code, as amended, attorneyâs\nfees are recoverable only against the culpable party in case of unlawful\nwithholding of wages, a situation not obtaining in the case at bar.â [12]\n\nThe Issues\n\nIn their\nMemorandum, [13] petitioners present the following\nissues: âWhether or not Respondent NLRC\ncommitted grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction 1. In reversing the finding of\nillegal dismissal of the labor arbiter who observed the demeanors of the\nwitnesses during the trial on the merits and in supplanting its conflicting\nrulings which are contrary to law and settled jurisprudence. 2. In finding petitioners to have\nvoluntarily resigned despite complete absence of any evidence of resignation\nand consequently in finding them as not illegally dismissed despite complete\nabsence on [sic] evidence that private respondent complied with the termination\nguidelines as mandated in Article 277 (b) and Rule XIV, Book V of the Rules\nImplementing the Labor Code, thus making the questioned decision as not\nsupported by evidence. 3. In not reinstating petitioners\nwith full backwages and other benefits until actual reinstatement and in not\ngranting their money claims for underpayment of wages, overtime pay and other\nbenefits, claims for moral and exemplary damages and attorneyâs fees against\nprivate respondent Henry Lao who has been established as a sexual harasser.â\n\nAt bottom, the\nresolution of this case hinges on this question: Were petitionersâ employment terminated because of resignation,\nabandonment or dismissal?\n\nThe Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe petition is\nmeritorious.\n\nMain Issue: Abandonment,\nResignation or Dismissal?\n\nPetitioners\nclaim that they were denied due process. In the first place, they were not even served âa formal notice of\ndismissal.â In particular, the\nviolation of procedural due process was manifested when Petitioner âMimi\nMacanlalay x x x was summarily discharged due to a mere say-so suspicion of\ndishonesty.â [14]\n\nPetitioners\nfurther allege that their dismissals were âoppressive and anti-social,â\ncomplaining that it was âoff-tangent and immaterialâ for private respondent to\ndiscuss the âtheft and price-cutting of some employees of respondent bazaar x x\nx because the offenses of some employees cannot be imputed against\npetitioners.â [15]\n\nPetitioners\nindignantly accuse the NLRC of being âbiased in favor of private respondent,â\nas shown when the Commission decreed the validity of their dismissals in the\nclear absence of evidence, and of issuing conflicting rulings to accommodate\nrespondent employer. [16] Buttressing their contention,\npetitioners point out that the award of separation pay expressly to Victoria\nSantos and Susan de Castro and impliedly to Mimi Macanlalay [17] indicates that they were illegally\ndismissed because, if they were not, then they should not have been awarded any\nseparation pay as was done to Lilia Pascua and Violeta Soriano. [18]\n\nPetitioners also\nallege that the NLRC abused its discretion when it ruled that they had been\nâvalidly dismissed and [that they] resigned voluntarily just because they\nreceived money from private respondent.â [19] Citing Molave Tours Corporation\nvs. NLRC, et al. , [20] they argue that since resignation must be made with\nthe intent of relinquishing oneâs office, the filing of their complaints for\nillegal dismissal is âwholly incompatibleâ with private respondentâs assertion\nthat they âvoluntarily resigned.â [21]\n\nUpholding public\nrespondent, the solicitor general contends that Petitioners Lilia Pascua,\nVictoria Santos and Susan C. De Castro resigned from their jobs; that Mimi\nMacanlalay voluntarily left private respondentâs employ; and that Petitioner\nVioleta Soriano was dismissed for just cause.\n\nPrivate\nrespondent, on the other hand, maintains the validity of the dismissal of the\npetitioners. It contends that the award\nof separation pay â[was] not inconsistent with the finding that there [was] no\nillegal dismissal since it was given by the employer as financial assistance.â [22]\n\nPrivate\nrespondent also insists that Petitioner Pascua clearly violated the company\nrule âthat only pants bought from Tiongsan may be worked on by the employees x\nx x.â [23] She was not dismissed but âsimply\ndid not report for work and instead demanded x x x separation pay.â [24] Petitioner Santos, on the other\nhand, âsimply did not report back to work after serving her thirty (30) days\nsuspension. Instead, she asked private\nrespondent to pay her separation pay computed at one (1) month pay for every\nyear of service.â [25] Petitioner Soriano was first\nsuspended for causing a âcommotion inside the store in the presence of\ncustomers.â Later, her employment was\nvalidly terminated. [26] Petitioner De Castro âshowed gross\ninsubordination and hostility towards private respondent [Henry Lao].â Though it is true that the latter had âsuggested to her to look for employment\nelsewhere, this certainly did not amount to a termination.â [27] Lastly, Petitioner Macanlalay\nâresigned.â [28]\n\nReview of Evidence in Labor Cases\n\nAs a rule,\npetitions for certiorari under Rule 65 involve only jurisdictional issues, or\ngrave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Hence, this Court refrains from reviewing\nfactual assessments of lower courts and agencies exercising adjudicative\nfunctions, such as the NLRC. Occasionally, however, this Court is constrained to wade into factual\nmatters when there is insufficient or insubstantial evidence on record to\nsupport those factual findings; or when too much is concluded, inferred or\ndeduced from the bare or incomplete facts appearing on record. In the present case, we find the need to\nreview the records to determine the facts with certainty not only because of\nthe foregoing inadequacies, but also because the NLRC and the labor arbiter\nhave come up with conflicting positions. [29]\n\nIn the present\ncase, the central question is: Was\npetitionersâ employment terminated in accordance with law? After poring over the records and the\nevidence, as well as the applicable law and jurisprudence, the Court is\nconvinced that the answer is âNo.â\n\nFirst. Basic is the doctrine that resignation must be voluntary and\nmade with the intention of relinquishing the office, accompanied with an act of relinquishment. [30] Based on the evidence on record, we\nare more than convinced that Petitioners Lilia Pascua, Mimi Macanlalay, Susan\nC. De Castro and Violeta Soriano did not voluntarily quit their jobs. Rather, they were forced to resign or were\nsummarily dismissed without just cause. Petitioners -- except Victoria L. Santos -- forthwith took steps to\nprotest their layoff and thus cannot, by any logic, be said to have abandoned\ntheir work. [31]\n\nSecond. In labor cases, the employer has the burden of proving that\nthe dismissal was for a just cause; failure to show this, as in the instant\ncase, would necessarily mean that the dismissal was unjustified and, therefore,\nillegal. [32] To allow an employer to dismiss an\nemployee based on mere allegations and generalities would place the employee at the mercy of his employer;\nand the right to security of tenure, which this Court is bound to protect,\nwould be unduly emasculated. [33] Considering the antecedents in the\nsummary dismissals effected against Petitioners Pascua, Macanlalay, De Castro\nand Soriano, the causes asserted by private respondent are, at best, tenuous or\nconjectural; at worst, they are mere afterthoughts.\n\nThird. Under the Labor Code, as amended, the dismissal of an\nemployee which the employer must validate has a twofold requirement: one is substantive, the other\nprocedural. Not only must the dismissal\nbe for a just or an authorized cause as provided by law (Articles 282, 283 and\n284 of the Labor Code, as amended); the rudimentary requirements of due process\n-- the opportunity to be heard and to defend oneself -- must be observed as\nwell. [34]\n\nFourth. Petitioners Pascua and Macanlalayâs acceptance of separation\npay did not necessarily amount to estoppel; nor did it connote a waiver of\ntheir right to press for reinstatement, considering that such acceptance --\nparticularly by Petitioner Pascua who had to feed her four children [35] -- was due to dire financial\nnecessity. [36]\n\nBased on the\nabove postulates, the facts and the law as they apply to each petitioner shall\nnow be discussed.\n\nPetitioners Illegally Dismissed\n\nLilia Pascua. According to the NLRC, after being caught repairing the last of three\npairs of pants which were not bought at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar, Lilia Pascua\nadmitted the wrongdoing to Henry Lao, explaining that she was merely\naccommodating a certain Mrs. Manaois, who was allegedly Laoâs friend. She averred: [37] â5. That\nat almost 6:30 oâ clock in the evening of August 21, 1991, a close friend of my\nemployers whom I know as Ms. Manaois approached me and requested me to cut and\nsew the hem of her pants which I turned down; 6. That\nsaid Ms. Manaois however insisted that I work on her pants with the assurance\nthat she will be the one to talk to my employers anyway she is their âkumadreâ\nsuch that with said assurance I started to put my line (âguhitâ) on the hem of\nthe pants at which time, Henry Lao approached us and questioned my act;â\n\nThereupon, she\nwas scolded and suspended by Lao, after which, the NLRC found, she decided to\nresign from private respondentâs employ.\n\nWe cannot accept\nthe NLRCâs simplistic findings. The\nuncontested affidavit of Petitioner Pascua provides the evidence conveniently\nignored by the NLRC, which shows the folly of the alleged resignation: [38] â7. That\nHenry Lao shouted at me and told me to go upstairs to the counter so that I can\nsign for my suspension and hurried me up by pushing me by my shoulders towards\nthe direction of the counter and as soon as I was there, he hurriedly let me\nsign a blank paper and no copy was given to me; 8. That\nthereafter, Henry Lao kept pushing me by my shoulders as he repeatedly told me\nin a loud manner, âpakuwenta mo na ang separation pay mo at hindi ka na rin\nmakakabalik. Puntahan mo ang\naccountant.â which made me nervous and afraid especially that he kept on\npushing me even when I was already on top of the stairs; 9. That\non August 22, 1991, as instructed by Henry Lao, I went to the accountant for\nthe computation of my separation pay which she computed after which I went to\nTiong San Super Bazaar where I was paid the computed separation pay of P 8,010.;â (Emphasis supplied).\n\nIt is evident\nfrom the above that, contrary to private respondentâs allegation, Petitioner\nPascua was forced to resign -- an act which was tantamount to a dismissal, an\nillegal one at that.\n\nWas there any valid\ncause for her dismissal? [39] The solicitor general submits: âIt must be pointed out that Henry Lao was\nacting within his rights when he chastised and suspended petitioner for\nflagrant violation of company rules.â [40] We do not agree. To be a just cause for an employeeâs\ndismissal, wilful disobedience must show the following: the employeeâs assailed conduct must have\nbeen wilful or intentional, the wilfulness being characterized by a âwrongful\nand perverse attitudeâ; and the order violated must have been reasonable,\nlawful, made known to the employee and pertinent to the duties which he or she\nhad been engaged to discharge. In this\nlight, not every case of so-called wilful disobedience by an employee can\nreasonably be penalized with dismissal. [41]\n\nIn the present\ncase, Petitioner Pascua was aware of the close relationship between Henry Lao\nand Mrs. Manaois. Indeed, Lao himself\ndid not deny that he knew Manaois. Thus, Pascua feared that, if she turned down Mrs. Manaoisâ request, she\nwould be subjected to public scolding by Lao. Thus, accommodation of the said request may have been an act of\ndisobedience of her employerâs order, but hardly an instance of the âwrongful\nand perverse attitudeâ that would warrant a penalty as grave as dismissal. Fairness requires that dismissal, being the\nultimate penalty that can be meted out to an employee, must have a clear basis. [42] Any ambiguity in the ground for the\ntermination of an employee should be interpreted against the employer, who\nordained such ground in the first place.\n\nSusan De\nCastro . Finding that she was ânot at all dismissed,â\nthe NLRC, as well as the labor arbiter, ruled that Petitioner De Castro was\nâsimilarly situated as petitioner Santos.â We do not agree.\n\nFirst of all,\nthe NLRC could not explain the contradictions in Petitioner De Castroâs\ncase. If she had not been dismissed but\nwas still an employee of private respondent, then why did she file this case\nfor illegal dismissal? And even more\nperplexing: Why would the NLRC conclude\nthat reinstatement was no longer possible because of the partiesâ\nârespective imputations of charges against each otherâ?\n\nFurthermore, the\nlabor arbiterâs finding that there was no evidence on record to establish her\ndismissal is refuted by these uncontested allegations of Petitioner De Castro: [43] â2. Complainant\nSusan de Castro, in Case No. -0377-91, was also a saleslady of the Tiongsan\nSuper Bazaar from May 16, 1987 to November 19, 1991. She worked every day except Mondays, her restday [sic], in nine and\na half hours (9 Â½) but she was required to fill up her daily time records\nreflecting eight (8) hours work only. Her wage rates were as follows:\n\nP 40/day - May 16, 1987 to December 31/87\n\n64/day - January/88 to September 30/89\n\n89/day - October/89 to November 30, 1990\n\n99/day - December 1/90 to April 30/91\n\n106/day - May 1/91 to November 19, 1991. Complainant was not paid her legal\nbenefits such as underpayment of basic wage, unpaid overtime pay, premiums for\nrestday [sic] and holiday pay, incentive leave pay and 13th month pay\ndifferentials. That on November 19,\n1991 she was dismissed summarily, whimsically and capriciously in this\nmanner: When she filled up her daily\ntime record correctly and demanded payment of her correct wage/overtime pay,\nrespondent Henry Lao flared up and said: âHuwag ka ng pumasok? [sic] Suspended ka na! Antayin mo na lang ang sulat ko! You are excused, goodbye!â And\nshe was not allowed to report for work anymore.â (Emphasis supplied).\n\nWhat further\nmuddles the issue of dismissal is the grant of separation pay. The solicitor general contends that, since\nprivate respondent was not averse to giving separation pay to Petitioners\nPascua and Macanlalay, it may also be required to pay separation pay to those\nemployees who âleave its employ.â [44] The grant of separation pay,\nhowever, is inconsistent with existing employment or voluntary resignation, for\nit presupposes illegal dismissal. [45]\n\nThe solicitor\ngeneral rationalizes the award of separation pay as one that is based on\nâequitable consideration;â that is, it was for the purpose of providing\npetitioner the âwherewithal during the period that she is looking for another\nemployment.â [46] This explanation is\nunacceptable. If petitioner was legally\ndismissed, as the solicitor general held, then the NLRC erred in finding her\nâentitled to separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement.â Indeed, if she was dismissed for cause,\njurisprudence demands that she should not be granted any award for the\nwrongdoing she was alleged to have committed; nor is she entitled to\nreinstatement and back wages. [47]\n\nWhile this Court\nhas allowed the grant of separation pay âas a measure of social justice,â\nsettled is the rule that separation pay is allowed only in those instances in\nwhich the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious\nmisconduct or those involving his moral character. [48] And certainly, the charge against\nde Castro -- falsifying her daily time records -- involves her moral character.\n\nMimi\nMacanlalay . According to the NLRC, Petitioner Macanlalay\nâvoluntarily left private respondentâs employ.â The solicitor general, in turn, alleges that this is supported by the finding of the labor arbiter that\nshe âlodged her complaint, because her separation pay [was] too little.â [49]\n\nThe evidence on\nrecord negates resignation. Petitioner Macanlalay contends that, prior to her\nemployment at Tiongsan Super Bazaar, she had been a saleslady at Rommelâs which\nwas owned by a certain Mrs. Tan. On\nSeptember 20, 1991, while she was working as a cashier at Tiongsan, Mrs. Tan\nsaw her; thereupon, Mrs. Tan reported to Henry Lao that Petitioner Macanlalay\nhad previously been dismissed for alleged dishonesty. Petitioner was then called by Lao and unceremoniously told: âKunin mo na ang separation pay mo. Pa total mo na sa accountant . At huwag ka ng magtrabajo dito. â [50]\n\nClearly, she did\nnot resign; she was orally dismissed by Lao. It is this lack of clear, valid and legal cause, not to mention due\nprocess, that made her dismissal illegal, warranting reinstatement and the\naward of back wages. [51]\n\nVioleta M.\nSoriano. The solicitor general contends that\nthe two labor tribunals were correct in holding that Petitioner Soriano was\nâdismissed for just causes,â namely: (1) the omission of an entry in her daily time record and her attempt to\nprevent the writing of âno entryâ thereon; (2) her reservation of certain\nmerchandise which she intended to purchase without informing the management;\nand (3) her absences without prior approval. Here, however, the solicitor general declares that private respondent is\nsubject to sanction âfor its failure to accord Petitioner Soriano the right to\nan administrative investigation in conformity with the procedural requirements\nof due process.â [52]\n\nWe do not agree\nwith the solicitor general. The NLRC\njustified Petitioner Sorianoâs dismissal by alleging that it was due to her\nfailure to make regular entries in her daily time records. We believe, however, that this alleged âjust\ncauseâ was convincingly disputed by Petitioner Soriano in her letter dated\nNovember 9, 1991, which states: [53] âFirst, with respect to your\nfinding that I have not been filling up my daily time record daily, I would\nlike to remind you that you are the one who established said system or practice\nwhich is applicable to all employees in your establishment with specific\ninstructions from you as to what working hours are supposed to be reflected\ntherein which is limited to only eight (8) hours a day although I and the other\nemployees regularly and normally render work beyond eight (8) hours daily. With such system, you do not expect me and\nmy co-employees to do otherwise for fear of being charged by you for\ndisobedience to your instructions and consequently be the subject of persistent\nharassments and unnecessary confrontations with you. In other words, if I and my co-employees have not been filling up\nour daily time record on a daily basis, it was more in accordance with your\nspecific instructions. It is indeed a\nsurprise to me why it is only now that you are seemingly making a big issue out\nof a system that you yourself has [sic] created and this time in a way that is\nagainst me when I do not have anything to do with said system that you imposed\non me and co-employees. Besides, this\nis what I had been doing from the time I was employed in your establishment to\nNovember 07, 1991 [in] accordance with your instructions. It would seem however that you instructed\nDasig to fill up my daily time record by placing therein âno entryâ for the\nblank spaces provided for November 3 to 7, 1991, inclusive, which I asked her\nto sign but she refused to do so. Likewise, you verbally told me today that I had to leave the premises at\n5:30 p.m. and to work for only eight (8) hours which I did not do considering\nthat this would be a sudden change of my regular working hours. x x xâ\n\nThe labor\narbiter sustained Petitioner Sorianoâs explanation, holding thus: [54] âVioleta Soriano, was first\nrelieved from her position as cashier, after the August 7, 1991 incident. On October 9, 1991, she executed an\naffidavit attesting that, the workers at Tiongsan Super Bazaar were\nunderpaid. (See Vol. I, p. 53, record\nof Lilia Pascua) According to the\nrespondent, after she was relieved from her position, she refused to perform\nthe task, that, she had been previously doing. When she was confronted by Mr. Lao, why she was behaving that way, she\nflared up. Due to this, she was issued\na memorandum for insubordination. (See\nVol. II, p. 157, record of Macanlalay, et al. cases) Another memorandum was issued on November 8, 1991, directing her\nto explain why she had not been filling up her daily time records. (See Vol. II, p. 86) A notice of preventive suspension was issued\nto her on November 10, 1991. (See Vol.\nII, p. 89) And, finally a notice of\ndismissal dated December 8, 1991. (See\nVol. II, p. 90) Complainant believes that these\nseries of memoranda, were issued by respondent only after he failed to convince\nher to retract her statement that she executed in favor of Lilia Pascua. (See Vol. II, p. 63, record of Macanlalay,\net al. v- Henry Lao) The respondentâs decision to\ndismiss is hazy. It does not contain\nany findings of fact, and the basis for the imposition of the penalty. As evidenced by the records, there\nshould have been no basis for the issuance of the notice of preventive\nsuspension that was issued on November 10, 1991. Granting, that, it is true that, complainant refused to receive\non November 8, 1991, (see Vol. II, p. 86) she submitted her explanation on\nNovember 10, 1991, at 8:30 a.m. (See p. 88, ibid ) There is likewise no basis for the\naccusation that complainant made an unauthorized change in her lunch\nbreak. (See p. 89, ibid) Respondent himself confirmed that his\nsalesladies were free to arrange among themselves their time. (TSN, Henry Lao, February 10, 1994, p. 40) xxx xxx xxx It has been held, that, the\nemployer is possessed with an inherent right to dismiss an employee for loss of\nconfidence. The Court has a plethora of\ndecisions that supports and recognizes this authority of the employer to sever\nits relationship with the employee involving such cases. However, loss of confidence as a valid cause\nto terminate an employee must nonetheless rest on an actual breach of duty\ncommitted by the employee and not on the employerâs imagined whim or\ncaprice. The employerâs evidence must\nclearly and convincingly establish the facts and incidents upon which the loss\nof confidence in the employee may fairly be made to rest. (Estiva v- NLRC, 22 SCRA 169, other\ncitations omitted) The respondent failed to establish\nthe bases for the complainantsâ dismissal. They were illegally dismissed.â (Emphasis supplied).\n\nTo find a\nconvenient justification to dismiss an employee, Henry Lao cannot unilaterally\nchange the previous rule -- irregular as it may have been -- regarding entries\nin daily time records without first informing petitioners, particularly\nSoriano, of such change. True, an\nemployee may be validly dismissed for violation of a reasonable company rule or\nregulation adopted for the conduct of the companyâs business. It is equally true, however, that company\npolicies and regulations are generally valid and binding on the parties and\nmust be complied with until finally revised or amended by competent authority. [55] It is settled, too, that -- in\norder that an employer may terminate the services of an employee on the ground\nof wilful disobedience of the formerâs orders, regulations or instructions --\nit must be established that the said orders, regulations, or instructions are\n(1) reasonable and lawful, (2) sufficiently known to the employee , and\n(3) connected with the duties which the employee has been engaged to discharge. [56]\n\nPetitioner Santos Resigned\n\nWe agree that\nPetitioner Santos voluntarily resigned. The labor arbiter did not find Petitioner Santos [or Petitioner De\nCastro] to have been illegally dismissed: [57] âRespondent states, that, Victoria\nSantos and Susan de Castro were not dismissed, but if they reported back, Mr.\nLao, had valid grounds to dismiss them. Except for the sweeping accusations, there is no evidence on record to\nsupport their dismissal. Therefore,\nthis Labor Arbiter is not in a position to declare that complainants Santos and\nDe Castro have forfeited their employment with respondent.â\n\nLikewise, the\nNLRC ruled that Victoria L. Santos was not dismissed. Rather, after her suspension for âcharging for a meter of cloth\nbought [at] the price of a yard,â [58] she offered to resign. The solicitor general supports this by\nstating that âeven the Labor Arbiter discovered this when he ruled that âthere\n[was] no evidence on record to support their [Santosâ and De Castroâs]\ndismissal.ââ [59]\n\nNotwithstanding\nhis assertion that Petitioner Santos had resigned, the solicitor general\nsustained the award of separation pay to her, because she had a âright to return\nto private respondent bazaar,â which she could have exercised if not for her\nâstrained relationshipâ [60] with its owner.\n\nPetitioner\nSantos contends that the affidavit she executed on October 9, 1991 caused her illegal summary\ndismissal. [61] As correctly found by the NLRC, this\nallegation defies logic, because Petitioner Santos was dismissed on September\n25, 1991, that is, prior to the execution of said affidavit.\n\nDamages and Attorneyâs Fees\n\nMoral damages\nare recoverable where the dismissal of the employee was attended by bad faith\nor constituted an act oppressive to labor or was done in a manner contrary to\nmorals, good customs or public policy. [62] Although the Labor Code is silent\non the liability of an employer for damages in case the termination of\nemployment is declared to be unjust, we have ruled, [63] however, that the employer may be\nso liable if, in terminating the employment, it also committed an antisocial\nand oppressive abuse of its right to investigate and dismiss its employee in\nviolation of Article 1701 of the Civil Code. [64] Thus, in CLLC E.G. Gochangco\nWorkers Union vs. NLRC, [65] we said: âAs for moral damages, we hold the\nsaid respondent liable therefor under the provisions of Article 2220 of the\nCivil Code providing for damages for âbreaches of contract where the defendant\nacted fraudulently or in bad faith.â We\ndeem just and proper the sum of P 5,000.00 each in favor of the\nterminated workers, in the concept of such damages.â\n\nIn cases\ninvolving breaches of contracts, moral damages may also be awarded where the\ndefendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith. [66] Good faith refers to a state of\nmind, which is manifested by the acts of the individual concerned. It consists of an intention to abstain from\ntaking an unconscionable and unscrupulous advantage of another. [67] Henry Laoâs dismissals of\npetitioners, except Santos who resigned, was marked by precipitate dispatch and\nutter disregard of due process. Clearly, Lao abused his position as an\nemployer.\n\nIt is\nwell-settled that, for dismissals to be valid, not only must employers show\nsufficient ground therefor, but must also prove that they observed procedural\ndue process by giving their employees two notices -- first, of the\nintention to dismiss, indicating therein their acts or omissions complained\nagainst; and, second, of the decision to dismiss â and, in between such\nnotices, an opportunity for them to answer and rebut the charges against them. [68] In the present case, not only was\nprivate respondentâs dismissal of petitioners without just cause; it was also\nwithout procedural due process.\n\nAttorneyâs fees\nmay likewise be awarded, for concerned petitioners were dismissed in bad faith. [69] Petitioner Pascua was summarily\ndismissed. Petitioner De Castro was also\ndismissed without due process after she demanded to be paid her correct wages\nas mandated by labor laws. Petitioner\nSoriano, in spite of her explanation in answer to the capricious charges raised\nby Henry Lao, was still summarily dismissed. Attorneyâs fees may be awarded when petitioners, illegally dismissed in\nbad faith, are compelled to litigate or incur expenses to protect their rights\nby reason of the acts and the omissions of their employer. [70]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED and\nthe assailed Decision and Resolution are hereby REVERSED and SET\nASIDE . Petitioners Pascua,\nMacanlalay, De Castro and Soriano are FOUND to have been illegally\ndismissed. Private respondents are ORDERED to REINSTATE them immediately without loss of seniority rights\nand with full back wages and other benefits from the time\nof their illegal dismissal up to the time of their actual reinstatement, [71] but the amounts already paid to\nPetitioners Pascua and Macanlalay shall be deducted from the sums respectively\ndue them. Each illegally dismissed petitioners is AWARDED P 25,000\nas moral damages plus ten percent of the total sum as and for attorneyâs\nfees. Having voluntarily resigned,\nPetitioner Santos is not entitled to the awards given to other petitioners. However, inasmuch as the private respondent\ndid not appeal, it is bound by the NLRCâs disposition in regard to Santos. [72] No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.
