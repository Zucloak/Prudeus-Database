  "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. SALVADOR MIRANDA Y CAPE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N PER CURIAM: For automatic review by this Court is the decision of the Regional Trial Court, 5th Judicial Region, Branch 57, Libmanan, Camarines Sur imposing the death penalty on the accused-appellant, Salvador Miranda for raping his fourteen-year old daughter, Teresita. The Information reads as follows: The undersigned 4th Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Camarines Sur, upon a sworn complaint filed by Teresita L. Miranda, hereby accuses SALVADOR MIRANDA y DOE for the crime of RAPE defined and penalized under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to R.A. 7659, committed as follows: That sometime in February, 1998 at Sitio Sampaloc, Barangay Banga Caves, Municipality of Ragay, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs, by means of force and intimidation, and while armed with a fan-knife, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with his 14 year old daughter, TERESITA L. MIRANDA against her will, to her damage and prejudice. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.[1] When arraigned on October 25, 1998, the accused-appellant pleaded ânot guilty.â Pre-trial was waived so trial ensued. The prosecution presented the victim and the medico-legal officer as witnesses. The medico-legal report was offered as their documentary evidence. For the defense, only the accused-appellant testified on his own behalf. On January 17, 2000, the RTC rendered its decision with the following dispositive portion: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Court finds the accused, SALVADOR MIRANDA, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, as defined and punished under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended, and hereby sentences him to the supreme penalty of DEATH. He is likewise directed to pay his daughter damages of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), exemplary damages of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) and to pay the costs of this suit. Considering his old age, however, this Court hereby recommends that the penalty be commuted to Reclusion Perpetua. Let the record of this case be forwarded to the Supreme Court on automatic review.[2] The facts as found by the trial court are as follows: Sometime in February 1998, Teresita (Tessie) did not go to school. Her other siblings were in school, while the older ones who were already married lived in their respective houses. Her mother was washing clothes near her brotherâs place, while her father was engaged in a drinking bout with four men. At about 12:00 noon, her father, smelling a gin, went inside their house, and pulled her towards the room. Tessie was not able to shout or make any sound, afraid that her father might hurt her. Her father removed her T-shirt and shorts and then undressed himself. He made her lie down on the floor, then he laid down also and inserted his penis into her vagina. The initial, unwelcome and detestable experience was excruciating that Tessie cried. She was still naked when her mother Rosella arrived. His father stood up, wore his shorts and did not answer his wifeâs query what he did to their child. Rosella got angry and asked her husband why did he do it, but the latter did not speak and just went away as if nothing happened. Tessie, in tears, told her mother about her carnal defilement in the hands of her father that day. The following day Tessie, together with her aunt, Casiana Miranda, went to Daet where she stayed with the latterâs daughter for a month, until her mother fetched her. Her elder sister Hilda Navarro, who came to learn of her fate from her mother, brought her to the police authorities. She executed a sworn statement before police at Ragay, Camarines Sur (Exhibit B, p. 4, Record). Dr. Marilyn Folloso, Municipal Health Officer of Ragay, examined Tessie Miranda on March 24, 1998. The medical certificate (Exhibit A, p.5, Record) indicated the following: âPertinent PE findings: Healed, Complete, Hymenal Laceration at 4:00 oâclockâ x x x[3] The accused-appellant denied the accusations and claimed that he was in the farm busy plowing the field in February, 1998. He denied that he was drunk that noon of February and asserted that he goes to the farm everyday, in February, or even before that month and also in March until he was arrested by the police.[4] In this appeal, the accused-appellant raised the lone assignment of error that: THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF RAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO STATE IN THE INFORMATION THE PRECISE DATE OF THE COMMISSION OF THE ALLEGED OFFENSE.[5] The accused-appellant asserts that the Information where he is charged for rape is fatally defective as it does not state the approximate time of the commission of the crime in violation of the Rules of Court.[6] The information merely states that the rape was allegedly committed âsometime in February 1988.â As it does not mention the precise time and date when the rape was committed; the Information must, therefore, be considered void. Such defect jeopardizes the right of the accused-appellant to be informed of the offense charged. With this constitutional infirmity, the accused-appellant deserves an acquittal. The contention is untenable. In refutation of accused-appellantâs argument, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presented adequate jurisprudence on the matter that it is not necessary for the information to allege the date and time of the commission of the crime with exactitude unless the time is an essential ingredient of the crime.[7] In the crime of rape, the time of its commission is not âa material ingredient of the offense.â[8] It is sufficient that the act complained of is alleged to have taken place âas near to the actual date at which the offense was committed as the information or complaint will permit.â[9] It can not be said that the accused-appellant was not properly apprised of the charges proffered against him. There is, therefore, no merit in accused-appellantâs appeal. After a careful review, we find the findings and conclusions of the trial court to be in accord with the law and jurisprudence and supported by evidence. The trial court gave credence to the testimony of the victim because she testified in a candid and straightforward manner. It had the badges of truth considering that the trial court found no motive which would make her testify falsely against the father if she has not really been aggrieved. She testified, to wit: PROS.

Nonetheless, the trial court justified the presence of force and intimidation in the case, as it correctly explained, that: xxx In a rape case by a father against her own daughter, his moral ascendancy and influence over the latter can sufficiently substitute for violence and intimidation. Thus, even without any weapon, his being a father is enough to intimidate and bring dread to a very young daughter.[11] Indeed, in cases of incestuous rape, the accused-appellantâs moral ascendancy over the victim takes the place of the force and intimidation in rape.[12] The force and intimidation is subjective and should be viewed in the context of the victimâs perception and judgment at that time of the commission of the offense.[13] Teresita testified that she submitted herself to the father because she was afraid that he might hurt her. She noticed that his father was drunk, knowing that he had a drinking spree in their house at that time. No words of threat were necessary because her fatherâs presence and moral ascendancy was intimidating enough for Teresita not to resist his advances. The fact that Teresita failed to put up a strong resistance or shout for help cannot be considered consent. This lack of resistance on the part of the victim as a product of the moral ascendancy is very well explained in the case of People v. Chua:[14] In Philippine society, the father is considered the head of the family, and the children are taught not to defy the fatherâs authority even when this is abused. They are taught to respect the sanctity of marriage and to value the family above everything else. Hence, when the abuse begins, the victim sees no reason or need to question the righteousness of the father whom she had trusted right from the start. The value of respect and obedience to parents instilled among Filipino children is transferred into the very same value that exposes them to risks of exploitation by their own parents. The sexual relationship could begin so subtly that the child does not realize that it is abnormal. Physical force then becomes unnecessary. The perpetrator takes full advantage of this blood relationship. Most daughters cooperate and this is one reason why they suffer tremendous guilt later on. It is almost impossible for a daughter to reject her fatherâs advances, for children seldom question what grown-ups tell them to do. Apparently in the case at bar, the accused-appellant certainly abused the reverence and respect which his daughter had for him as he was successful in forcing her to submit to his lust. The pain and trauma which she experienced could not be concealed. Her anger and resentment against her father was clearly manifested in her testimony. When asked on cross-examination, she knew and understood the consequences of her charge for she had this determined resolve to put her father to death as a result of the incident. When a woman says that she has been raped, she says, in effect, all that is necessary to show that she has indeed been raped.[15] She testified on cross-examination: ATTY. MIRABUENO: Q You said that your father and uncle and two other persons were drinking at that time, can you still remember that? A Yes, Sir. Q What were they drinking? A Tanduay, Sir. ATTY. MIRABUENO: Q You said during direct examination, your father drinking gin and now you said drinking Tanduay, which is now correct, Gin or Tanduay? A Tanduay, Sir. Q So your testimony that he smelled Gin is not correct? A Yes, Sir. Q What time did they start drinking? A 11:00 A.M., Sir. Q And what time did they finish in drinking? A I do not know, Sir. Q Did they drink up to afternoon? A No, Sir. Q Up to 1:00 oâclock in the afternoon? A No, Sir. Q Up to 12:00 Noon? A Before 12:00 Noon, Sir. Q Aside from them, as you mentioned they were four persons drinking, was there any other persons at that time? A None, Sir. Q When your father, according to you, he pulled you, did you not shout? A No, Sir. Q Did you not ask your father, why you were being pulled by him? A No, Sir. Q After the following day that your father allegedly insert his penis to your vagina, did you tell to anybody of what happened to you? A Yes, Sir. Q To whom? A To my sister, Sir. Q What time did you tell to her? A My mother was the one who told her. Q So, it was your mother who told her and not you, is that correct? A Yes, Sir. Q Now, do you know that if found out your father really raped you, he put to death, you understand that? A Yes, Sir. Q Do you want your father to die? A Yes, Sir. Q You can not forgive your father? A No, Sir. ATTY. MIRABUENO: Thatâs all, Your Honor. COURT: Q Where is your mother, Tessie? A She is outside, Maâam. Q Why, that your sister only who helping you in this case? A When I arrived in Daet, Nilda is not supporting me, but when my mother took me from Daet, Ate Nilda brought me to the Police. Q Are you angry with your father? A Yes, Maâam. COURT: Q Why? A Because of what did he do it to me. Q Before the alleged incident, is your father angry to you? A I do not know, Maâam. Q Even before that date, did he hurt you? A No, Maâam. Q Was this is (sic) first time did your father to you? A Yes, Maâam. Q When your mother arrived, was he still on top of you? A No more, Maâam. Q Do you know that your parents are instrument in giving your life? A Yes, Maâam. Q Before the incident, did you love your parents particularly your father? A Yes, Maâam. Q But now, you want that your father be sentenced to death? A Yes, Maâam. Q What did you feel now, for what your father do to you? A Painful, Maâam.[16] The accused-appellant merely denied raping his daughter and interposed alibi for his defense. Unfortunately, this self-serving denial can not prevail over the affirmative and categorical assertions of the victim which the trial court found to be more credible. For alibi to prosper, the accused-appellant must prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed and it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime.[17] In the case at bar, the farm was not too far from the house and the accused-appellant even admitted that he goes home for lunch. Thus, it was not impossible that the accused-appellant committed the dastardly act on his daughter on that fateful afternoon. The rape committed on the victim falls under the qualifying circumstances listed under R.A. 7659.[18] considering the relationship of the accused-appellant to the victim and the latterâs minority in which case the imposition of the death penalty is mandatory.[19] The concurrence of these two circumstances must not only be pleaded in the information but must, likewise, be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution presented the birth certificate,[20] to show that the victim was only 13 years old at the time of the incident and that Salvador Miranda was her father.[21] At the time she testified in court in 1999, it was not difficult for the trial court to take judicial notice that the victim was certainly under 18 years old. We note the trial courtâs disposition recommending a commutation of this sentence to reclusion perpetua considering the alleged old age of the accused-appellant. The records reveal that the accused-appellant was only 55 years old at the time he testified in court in 1999.[22] Obviously, he does not enjoy the commutation of penalty provided by law.[23] The law may be exceedingly hard but so the law is written and the Court is duty bound to apply it.[24] The death penalty is certainly irrevocable and deplorable but given the pertinent circumstances obtaining in this case which have been duly proven by the prosecution, the Court is constrained to affirm the imposable penalty of death in this case.[25] Finally, the award of damages by the trial court should also be modified in line with recent jurisprudence on the matter. In addition to the moral damages of P50,000.00 which need not be proven, a civil indemnity of P75,000.00 is awarded if the crime was committed under circumstances that justify the imposition of the death penalty.[26] Exemplary damages should also be reduced to P25,000.00,[27] to deter fathers from abusing their daughters. WHEREFORE, the decision of the trial court in Criminal case No. L-2071 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the accused-appellant is ordered to pay complainant Teresita Miranda the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages. In accordance with Section 25 of R.A. No. 7659, amending Art. 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon the finality of this decision, let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the President of the Philippines for the possible exercise of the pardoning power.

Considering his old age,\n however, this Court hereby recommends that the penalty be commuted to Reclusion Perpetua .\n\nLet the record of this case be forwarded to the Supreme Court on automatic review. [2]\n\nThe facts as found by the trial court are as follows:\n\nSometime in February 1998, Teresita (Tessie) did not go to \nschool. Her other siblings were in school, while the older ones who were\n already married lived in their respective houses. Her mother was \nwashing clothes near her brotherâs place, while her father was engaged \nin a drinking bout with four men. At about 12:00 noon, her father, \nsmelling a gin, went inside their house, and pulled her towards the \nroom. Tessie was not able to shout or make any sound, afraid that her \nfather might hurt her. Her father removed her T-shirt and shorts and \nthen undressed himself. He made her lie down on the floor, then he laid \ndown also and inserted his penis into her vagina. The initial, unwelcome\n and detestable experience was excruciating that Tessie cried. She was \nstill naked when her mother Rosella arrived. His father stood up, wore \nhis shorts and did not answer his wifeâs query what he did to their \nchild. Rosella got angry and asked her husband why did he do it, but the\n latter did not speak and just went away as if nothing happened. Tessie,\n in tears, told her mother about her carnal defilement in the hands of \nher father that day. The following day Tessie, together with her aunt, \nCasiana Miranda, went to Daet where she stayed with the latterâs \ndaughter for a month, until her mother fetched her. Her elder sister \nHilda Navarro, who came to learn of her fate from her mother, brought \nher to the police authorities. She executed a sworn statement before \npolice at Ragay, Camarines Sur (Exhibit B, p. 4, Record).\n\nDr. Marilyn Folloso, Municipal Health Officer of Ragay, examined \nTessie Miranda on March 24, 1998. The medical certificate (Exhibit A, \np.5, Record) indicated the following:\n\nâPertinent PE findings:\n\nHealed, Complete, Hymenal Laceration at 4:00 oâclockâ\n\nx x x [3]\n\nThe accused-appellant denied the accusations and claimed that he \nwas in the farm busy plowing the field in February, 1998. He denied that\n he was drunk that noon of February and asserted that he goes to the \nfarm everyday, in February, or even before that month and also in March \nuntil he was arrested by the police. [4]\nIn this appeal, the accused-appellant raised the lone assignment of error that:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF \nRAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO STATE IN THE INFORMATION THE \nPRECISE DATE OF THE COMMISSION OF THE ALLEGED OFFENSE. [5]\n\nThe accused-appellant asserts that the Information where he is \ncharged for rape is fatally defective as it does not state the \napproximate time of the commission of the crime in violation of the \nRules of Court. [6]\n\nThe information merely states that the rape was allegedly committed\n âsometime in February 1988.â As it does not mention the precise time \nand date when the rape was committed; the Information must, therefore, \nbe considered void. Such defect jeopardizes the right of the \naccused-appellant to be informed of the offense charged. With this \nconstitutional infirmity, the accused-appellant deserves an acquittal.\n\nThe contention is untenable.\n\nIn refutation of accused-appellantâs argument, the Office of the \nSolicitor General (OSG) presented adequate jurisprudence on the matter \nthat it is not necessary for the information to allege the date and time\n of the commission of the crime with exactitude unless the time is an \nessential ingredient of the crime. [7] In the crime of rape, the time of its commission is not âa material ingredient of the offense.â [8] It is sufficient that the act complained of is alleged to have taken \nplace âas near to the actual date at which the offense was committed as \nthe information or complaint will permit.â [9] It can not be said that the accused-appellant was not properly apprised\n of the charges proffered against him. There is, therefore, no merit in \naccused-appellantâs appeal.\n\nAfter a careful review, we find the findings and conclusions of the\n trial court to be in accord with the law and jurisprudence and \nsupported by evidence. The trial court gave credence to the testimony of\n the victim because she testified in a candid and straightforward \nmanner. It had the badges of truth considering that the trial court \nfound no motive which would make her testify falsely against the father \nif she has not really been aggrieved. She testified, to wit:\n\nPROS.

Nonetheless, the trial court justified the presence of \nforce and intimidation in the case, as it correctly explained, that:\n\nxxx In a rape case by a father against her own daughter, his \nmoral ascendancy and influence over the latter can sufficiently \nsubstitute for violence and intimidation. Thus, even without any weapon,\n his being a father is enough to intimidate and bring dread to a very \nyoung daughter. [11]\n\nIndeed, in cases of incestuous rape, the accused-appellantâs moral \nascendancy over the victim takes the place of the force and intimidation\n in rape. [12] The force and \nintimidation is subjective and should be viewed in the context of the \nvictimâs perception and judgment at that time of the commission of the \noffense. [13] Teresita \ntestified that she submitted herself to the father because she was \nafraid that he might hurt her. She noticed that his father was drunk, \nknowing that he had a drinking spree in their house at that time. No \nwords of threat were necessary because her fatherâs presence and moral \nascendancy was intimidating enough for Teresita not to resist his \nadvances. The fact that Teresita failed to put up a strong resistance or\n shout for help cannot be considered consent. This lack of resistance on\n the part of the victim as a product of the moral ascendancy is very \nwell explained in the case of People v. Chua: [14]\n\nIn Philippine society, the father is considered the head of the \nfamily, and the children are taught not to defy the fatherâs authority \neven when this is abused. They are taught to respect the sanctity of \nmarriage and to value the family above everything else. Hence, when the \nabuse begins, the victim sees no reason or need to question the \nrighteousness of the father whom she had trusted right from the start. \nThe value of respect and obedience to parents instilled among Filipino \nchildren is transferred into the very same value that exposes them to \nrisks of exploitation by their own parents. The sexual relationship \ncould begin so subtly that the child does not realize that it is \nabnormal. Physical force then becomes unnecessary. The perpetrator takes\n full advantage of this blood relationship. Most daughters cooperate and\n this is one reason why they suffer tremendous guilt later on. It is \nalmost impossible for a daughter to reject her fatherâs advances, for \nchildren seldom question what grown-ups tell them to do.\n\nApparently in the case at bar, the accused-appellant certainly \nabused the reverence and respect which his daughter had for him as he \nwas successful in forcing her to submit to his lust. The pain and trauma\n which she experienced could not be concealed. Her anger and resentment \nagainst her father was clearly manifested in her testimony. When asked \non cross-examination, she knew and understood the consequences of her \ncharge for she had this determined resolve to put her father to death as\n a result of the incident. When a woman says that she has been raped, \nshe says, in effect, all that is necessary to show that she has indeed \nbeen raped. [15] She testified on cross-examination:\n\nATTY. MIRABUENO:\n\nQ You said that your father and uncle and two other persons were drinking at that time, can you still remember that?\nA Yes, Sir.\n\nQ What were they drinking?\nA Tanduay, Sir.\n\nATTY. MIRABUENO:\n\nQ You said during direct examination, your father drinking \ngin and now you said drinking Tanduay, which is now correct, Gin or \nTanduay?\nA Tanduay, Sir.\n\nQ So your testimony that he smelled Gin is not correct?\nA Yes, Sir.\n\nQ What time did they start drinking?\nA 11:00 A.M., Sir.\n\nQ And what time did they finish in drinking?\nA I do not know, Sir.\n\nQ Did they drink up to afternoon?\nA No, Sir.\n\nQ Up to 1:00 oâclock in the afternoon?\nA No, Sir.\n\nQ Up to 12:00 Noon?\nA Before 12:00 Noon, Sir.\n\nQ Aside from them, as you mentioned they were four persons drinking, was there any other persons at that time?\nA None, Sir.\n\nQ When your father, according to you, he pulled you, did you not shout?\nA No, Sir.\n\nQ Did you not ask your father, why you were being pulled by him?\nA No, Sir.\n\nQ After the following day that your father allegedly insert \nhis penis to your vagina, did you tell to anybody of what happened to \nyou?\nA Yes, Sir.\n\nQ To whom?\nA To my sister, Sir.\n\nQ What time did you tell to her?\nA My mother was the one who told her.\n\nQ So, it was your mother who told her and not you, is that correct?\nA Yes, Sir.\n\nQ Now, do you know that if found out your father really raped you, he put to death, you understand that?\nA Yes, Sir.\n\nQ Do you want your father to die?\nA Yes, Sir.\n\nQ You can not forgive your father?\nA No, Sir.\n\nATTY. MIRABUENO:\n\nThatâs all, Your Honor.\n\nCOURT:\n\nQ Where is your mother, Tessie?\nA She is outside, Maâam.\n\nQ Why, that your sister only who helping you in this case?\nA When I arrived in Daet, Nilda is not supporting me, but when \nmy mother took me from Daet, Ate Nilda brought me to the Police.\n\nQ Are you angry with your father?\nA Yes, Maâam.\n\nCOURT:\n\nQ Why?\nA Because of what did he do it to me.\n\nQ Before the alleged incident, is your father angry to you?\nA I do not know, Maâam.\n\nQ Even before that date, did he hurt you?\nA No, Maâam.\n\nQ Was this is (sic) first time did your father to you?\nA Yes, Maâam.\n\nQ When your mother arrived, was he still on top of you?\nA No more, Maâam.\n\nQ Do you know that your parents are instrument in giving your life?\nA Yes, Maâam.\n\nQ Before the incident, did you love your parents particularly your father?\nA Yes, Maâam.\n\nQ But now, you want that your father be sentenced to death?\nA Yes, Maâam.\n\nQ What did you feel now, for what your father do to you?\nA Painful, Maâam. [16]\n\nThe accused-appellant merely denied raping his daughter and \ninterposed alibi for his defense. Unfortunately, this self-serving \ndenial can not prevail over the affirmative and categorical assertions \nof the victim which the trial court found to be more credible. For alibi\n to prosper, the accused-appellant must prove that he was somewhere else\n when the crime was committed and it was physically impossible for him \nto have been at the scene of the crime. [17] In the case at bar, the farm was not too far from the house and the \naccused-appellant even admitted that he goes home for lunch. Thus, it \nwas not impossible that the accused-appellant committed the dastardly \nact on his daughter on that fateful afternoon.\n\nThe rape committed on the victim falls under the qualifying circumstances listed under R.A. 7659. [18] considering the relationship of the accused-appellant to the victim and\n the latterâs minority in which case the imposition of the death penalty\n is mandatory. [19] The \nconcurrence of these two circumstances must not only be pleaded in the \ninformation but must, likewise, be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The \nprosecution presented the birth certificate, [20] to show that the victim was only 13 years old at the time of the incident and that Salvador Miranda was her father. [21] At the time she testified in court in 1999, it was not difficult for \nthe trial court to take judicial notice that the victim was certainly \nunder 18 years old.\n\nWe note the trial courtâs disposition recommending a commutation of\n this sentence to reclusion perpetua considering the alleged old age of \nthe accused-appellant. The records reveal that the accused-appellant was\n only 55 years old at the time he testified in court in 1999. [22] Obviously, he does not enjoy the commutation of penalty provided by law. [23] The law may be exceedingly hard but so the law is written and the Court is duty bound to apply it. [24] The death penalty is certainly irrevocable and deplorable but given the\n pertinent circumstances obtaining in this case which have been duly \nproven by the prosecution, the Court is constrained to affirm the \nimposable penalty of death in this case. [25]\n\nFinally, the award of damages by the trial court should also be \nmodified in line with recent jurisprudence on the matter. In addition to\n the moral damages of P50,000.00 which need not be proven, a civil \nindemnity of P75,000.00 is awarded if the crime was committed under \ncircumstances that justify the imposition of the death penalty. [26] Exemplary damages should also be reduced to P25,000.00, [27] to deter fathers from abusing their daughters.\n\nWHEREFORE, the decision of the trial court in \nCriminal case No. L-2071 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the \naccused-appellant is ordered to pay complainant Teresita Miranda the \namount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and\n P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.\nIn accordance with Section 25 of R.A.
