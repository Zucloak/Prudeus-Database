  "title": "JIMMY CO, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME & STYLE DRAGON METAL MANUFACTURING, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND BROADWAY MOTOR SALES CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N MARTINEZ, J.: On July 18, 1990, petitioner entrusted his Nissan pick-up car 1988 model[1] to private respondent - which is engaged in the sale, distribution and repair of motor vehicles - for the following job repair services and supply of parts: - Bleed injection pump and all nozzles; - Adjust valve tappet; - Change oil and filter; - Open up and service four wheel brakes, clean and adjust; - Lubricate accelerator linkages; - Replace aircon belt; and - Replace battery[2] Private respondent undertook to return the vehicle on July 21, 1990 fully serviced and supplied in accordance with the job contract. After petitioner paid in full the repair bill in the amount of P1,397.00,[3] private respondent issued to him a gate pass for the release of the vehicle on said date. But came July 21, 1990, the latter could not release the vehicle as its battery was weak and was not yet replaced. Left with no option, petitioner himself bought a new battery nearby and delivered it to private respondent for installation on the same day. However, the battery was not installed and the delivery of the car was rescheduled to July 24, 1990 or three (3) days later. When petitioner sought to reclaim his car in the afternoon of July 24, 1990, he was told that it was carnapped earlier that morning while being road-tested by private respondentâs employee along Pedro Gil and Perez Streets in Paco, Manila. Private respondent said that the incident was reported to the police. Having failed to recover his car and its accessories or the value thereof, petitioner filed a suit for damages against private respondent anchoring his claim on the latterâs alleged negligence. For its part, private respondent contended that it has no liability because the car was lost as a result of a fortuitous event - the carnapping. During pre-trial, the parties agreed that: â(T)he cost of the Nissan Pick-up four (4) door when the plaintiff purchased it from the defendant is P332,500.00 excluding accessories which were installed in the vehicle by the plaintiff consisting of four (4) brand new tires, magwheels, stereo speaker, amplifier which amount all in all to P20,000.00. It is agreed that the vehicle was lost on July 24, 1990 `approximately two (2) years and five (5) months from the date of the purchase.â It was agreed that the plaintiff paid the defendant the cost of service and repairs as early as July 21, 1990 in the amount of P1,397.00 which amount was received and duly receipted by the defendant company. It was also agreed that the present value of a brand new vehicle of the same type at this time is P425,000.00 without accessories.â[4] They likewise agreed that the sole issue for trial was who between the parties shall bear the loss of the vehicle which necessitates the resolution of whether private respondent was indeed negligent.[5] After trial, the court a quo found private respondent guilty of delay in the performance of its obligation and held it liable to petitioner for the value of the lost vehicle and its accessories plus interest and attorneyâs fees.[6] On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the ruling of the lower court and ordered the dismissal of petitionerâs damage suit.[7] The CA ruled that: (1) the trial court was limited to resolving the issue of negligence as agreed during pre-trial; hence it cannot pass on the issue of delay; and (2) the vehicle was lost due to a fortuitous event. In a petition for review to this Court, the principal query raised is whether a repair shop can be held liable for the loss of a customerâs vehicle while the same is in its custody for repair or other job services? The Court resolves the query in favor of the customer. First, on the technical aspect involved. Contrary to the CAâs pronouncement, the rule that the determination of issues at a pre-trial conference bars the consideration of other issues on appeal, except those that may involve privilege or impeaching matter,[8] is inapplicable to this case. The question of delay, though not specifically mentioned as an issue at the pre-trial may be tackled by the court considering that it is necessarily intertwined and intimately connected with the principal issue agreed upon by the parties, i.e. who will bear the loss and whether there was negligence. Petitionerâs imputation of negligence to private respondent is premised on delay which is the very basis of the formerâs complaint. Thus, it was unavoidable for the court to resolve the case, particularly the question of negligence without considering whether private respondent was guilty of delay in the performance of its obligation. On the merits. It is a not a defense for a repair shop of motor vehicles to escape liability simply because the damage or loss of a thing lawfully placed in its possession was due to carnapping. Carnapping per se cannot be considered as a fortuitous event. The fact that a thing was unlawfully and forcefully taken from anotherâs rightful possession, as in cases of carnapping, does not automatically give rise to a fortuitous event. To be considered as such, carnapping entails more than the mere forceful taking of anotherâs property. It must be proved and established that the event was an act of God or was done solely by third parties and that neither the claimant nor the person alleged to be negligent has any participation.[9] In accordance with the Rules of evidence, the burden of proving that the loss was due to a fortuitous event rests on him who invokes it[10]- which in this case is the private respondent. However, other than the police report of the alleged carnapping incident, no other evidence was presented by private respondent to the effect that the incident was not due to its fault. A police report of an alleged crime, to which only private respondent is privy, does not suffice to established the carnapping. Neither does it prove that there was no fault on the part of private respondent notwithstanding the partiesâ agreement at the pre-trial that the car was carnapped. Carnapping does not foreclose the possibility of fault or negligence on the part of private respondent. Even assuming arguendo that carnapping was duly established as a fortuitous event, still private respondent cannot escape liability. Article 1165[11] of the New Civil Code makes an obligor who is guilty of delay responsible even for a fortuitous event until he has effected the delivery. In this case, private respondent was already in delay as it was supposed to deliver petitionerâs car three (3) days before it was lost. Petitionerâs agreement to the rescheduled delivery does not defeat his claim as private respondent had already breached its obligation. Moreover, such accession cannot be construed as waiver of petitionerâs right to hold private respondent liable because the car was unusable and thus, petitioner had no option but to leave it. Assuming further that there was no delay, still working against private respondent is the legal presumption under Article 1265 that its possession of the thing at the time it was lost was due to its fault.[12] This presumption is reasonable since he who has the custody and care of the thing can easily explain the circumstances of the loss. The vehicle owner has no duty to show that the repair shop was at fault. All that petitioner needs to prove, as claimant, is the simple fact that private respondent was in possession of the vehicle at the time it was lost. In this case, private respondentâs possession at the time of the loss is undisputed. Consequently, the burden shifts to the possessor who needs to present controverting evidence sufficient enough to overcome that presumption. Moreover, the exempting circumstances - earthquake, flood, storm or other natural calamity - when the presumption of fault is not applicable[13] do not concur in this case. Accordingly, having failed to rebut the presumption and since the case does not fall under the exceptions, private respondent is answerable for the loss. It must likewise be emphasized that pursuant to Articles 1174 and 1262 of the New Civil Code, liability attaches even if the loss was due to a fortuitous event if âthe nature of the obligation requires the assumption of riskâ.[14] Carnapping is a normal business risk for those engaged in the repair of motor vehicles. For just as the owner is exposed to that risk so is the repair shop since the car was entrusted to it. That is why, repair shops are required to first register with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)[15] and to secure an insurance policy for the âshop covering the property entrusted by its customer for repair, service or maintenanceâ as a pre-requisite for such registration/accreditation.[16] Violation of this statutory duty constitutes negligence per se.[17] Having taken custody of the vehicle, private respondent is obliged not only to repair the vehicle but must also provide the customer with some form of security for his property over which he loses immediate control. An owner who cannot exercise the seven (7) juses or attributes of ownership â the right to possess, to use and enjoy, to abuse or consume, to accessories, to dispose or alienate, to recover or vindicate and to the fruits -[18] is a crippled owner. Failure of the repair shop to provide security to a motor vehicle owner would leave the latter at the mercy of the former. Moreover, on the assumption that private respondentâs repair business is duly registered, it presupposes that its shop is covered by insurance from which it may recover the loss. If private respondent can recover from its insurer, then it would be unjustly enriched if it will not compensate petitioner to whom no fault can be attributed. Otherwise, if the shop is not registered, then the presumption of negligence applies. One last thing. With respect to the value of the lost vehicle and its accessories for which the repair shop is liable, it should be based on the fair market value that the property would command at the time it was entrusted to it or such other value as agreed upon by the parties subsequent to the loss. Such recoverable value is fair and reasonable considering that the value of the vehicle depreciates. This value may be recovered without prejudice to such other damages that a claimant is entitled under applicable laws. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the Court Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the decision of the court a quo is REINSTATED. SO ORDERED.

[4] Rollo, pp. 28-29. [5] Rollo, p. 29. [6] The dispositive portion of the trial courtâs decision reads: âAccordingly, this Court finds the defendant liable to the plaintiff for the value of the vehicle in question. Defendant is ordered to pay plaintiff the value of the vehicle in the amount of Three Hundred Thirty Two Thousand Five Hundred Pesos representing the acquisition cost of the vehicle plus the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos representing the cost of the four brand new tires, magwheels, pioneer stereo, speakers, air-conditioner, which were installed by the plaintiff in his vehicle after the plaintiff bought the vehicle from the defendant. While it is true that plaintiff purchased from the defendant the vehicle about two years and five months before the same was lost, and therefore the vehicle had already depreciated from its original value at the time it was lost, it is also true as agreed upon by the parties in the pre-trial, that the present value of a brand new vehicle of the same type has at this time increased to Four Hundred Thousand Pesos without accessories, so whatever is awarded by this Court to the plaintiff in this decision would not even be sufficient to purchase a brand new vehicle at the present prices. This Court believes that the amount awarded to the plaintiff above-stated represents a fair compromise, considering the depreciation of the vehicle from the time it was purchased and to the time it was lost and which is off-seated by the increase cost of a brand new vehicle at the present time. Defendant is likewise ordered to pay plaintiff legal interest in the amount above-stated from the date of the finality of this decision until full payment of the obligation. Further, defendant is ordered to pay plaintiff Ten Thousand Pesos by attorneyâs fees.â (sic was not included so as not to clutter the narration); Rollo, pp. 78, 94.

CA, 173 SCRA 497 citing Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. v. Teodoro, 26 SCRA 332. In the Bergado case (p. 501), the court reiterated the rule that the specific exceptions to the general rule to be observed in pre-trials emphasized in Gicano v. Gegato, 157 SCRA 140 is âthat trial courts have authority and discretion to dismiss an action on the ground of prescription when the partiesâ pleadings or other facts on record show it to be indeed time-barred; and it may do so on the basis of a motion to dismiss, or an answer which sets up such ground as an affirmative defense; or even if the ground is alleged after judgment on the merits, as in a motion for reconsideration; or even if the defense has not been asserted at all, as where no statement thereof is found in the pleadings, or where a defendant had been declared in default. What is essential only, to repeat, is that the facts demonstrating the lapse of the prescriptive period, be otherwise sufficiently and satisfactorily apparent on the record; either in the averments of the plaintiffâs, or otherwise established by the evidence.\" [9] Lasam v.

D E C I S I O N\nJIMMY CO, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME & STYLE DRAGON METAL MANUFACTURING, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND BROADWAY MOTOR SALES CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nMARTINEZ, J.:\n\nOn July 18, 1990, petitioner entrusted his Nissan pick-up car 1988 model [1] to private respondent - which is engaged in the sale, distribution and \nrepair of motor vehicles - for the following job repair services and \nsupply of parts:\n\n- Bleed injection pump and all nozzles;\n- Adjust valve tappet;\n- Change oil and filter;\n- Open up and service four wheel brakes, clean and adjust;\n- Lubricate accelerator linkages;\n- Replace aircon belt; and\n- Replace battery [2]\n\nPrivate respondent undertook to return the vehicle on July 21, 1990 \nfully serviced and supplied in accordance with the job contract. After \npetitioner paid in full the repair bill in the amount of P1,397.00, [3] private respondent issued to him a gate pass for the release of the \nvehicle on said date. But came July 21, 1990, the latter could not \nrelease the vehicle as its battery was weak and was not yet replaced. \nLeft with no option, petitioner himself bought a new battery nearby and \ndelivered it to private respondent for installation on the same day. \nHowever, the battery was not installed and the delivery of the car was \nrescheduled to July 24, 1990 or three (3) days later. When petitioner \nsought to reclaim his car in the afternoon of July 24, 1990, he was told\n that it was carnapped earlier that morning while being road-tested by \nprivate respondentâs employee along Pedro Gil and Perez Streets in Paco,\n Manila. Private respondent said that the incident was reported to the \npolice.\n\nHaving failed to recover his car and its accessories or the value\n thereof, petitioner filed a suit for damages against private respondent\n anchoring his claim on the latterâs alleged negligence. For its part, \nprivate respondent contended that it has no liability because the car \nwas lost as a result of a fortuitous event - the carnapping. During \npre-trial, the parties agreed that:\n\nâ(T)he cost of the Nissan Pick-up four (4) door when the plaintiff \npurchased it from the defendant is P332,500.00 excluding accessories \nwhich were installed in the vehicle by the plaintiff consisting of four \n(4) brand new tires, magwheels, stereo speaker, amplifier which amount \nall in all to P20,000.00. It is agreed that the vehicle was lost on July\n 24, 1990 `approximately two (2) years and five (5) months from the date\n of the purchase.â It was agreed that the plaintiff paid the defendant \nthe cost of service and repairs as early as July 21, 1990 in the amount \nof P1,397.00 which amount was received and duly receipted by the \ndefendant company. It was also agreed that the present value of a brand \nnew vehicle of the same type at this time is P425,000.00 without \naccessories.â [4]\n\nThey likewise agreed that the sole issue for trial was who between \nthe parties shall bear the loss of the vehicle which necessitates the \nresolution of whether private respondent was indeed negligent. [5] After trial, the court a quo found private respondent guilty of delay in the performance of its \nobligation and held it liable to petitioner for the value of the lost \nvehicle and its accessories plus interest and attorneyâs fees. [6] On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the ruling of the lower \ncourt and ordered the dismissal of petitionerâs damage suit. [7] The CA ruled that: (1) the trial court was limited to resolving the \nissue of negligence as agreed during pre-trial; hence it cannot pass on \nthe issue of delay; and (2) the vehicle was lost due to a fortuitous \nevent.\n\nIn a petition for review to this Court, the principal query \nraised is whether a repair shop can be held liable for the loss of a \ncustomerâs vehicle while the same is in its custody for repair or other \njob services?\n\nThe Court resolves the query in favor of the customer. First, on \nthe technical aspect involved. Contrary to the CAâs pronouncement, the \nrule that the determination of issues at a pre-trial conference bars the\n consideration of other issues on appeal, except those that may involve \nprivilege or impeaching matter, [8] is inapplicable to this case. The question of delay, though not \nspecifically mentioned as an issue at the pre-trial may be tackled by \nthe court considering that it is necessarily intertwined and intimately \nconnected with the principal issue agreed upon by the parties, i.e. who \nwill bear the loss and whether there was negligence. Petitionerâs \nimputation of negligence to private respondent is premised on delay \nwhich is the very basis of the formerâs complaint. Thus, it was \nunavoidable for the court to resolve the case, particularly the question\n of negligence without considering whether private respondent was guilty\n of delay in the performance of its obligation.\n\nOn the merits. It is a not a defense for a repair shop of motor \nvehicles to escape liability simply because the damage or loss of a \nthing lawfully placed in its possession was due to carnapping. \nCarnapping per se cannot be considered as a fortuitous event. \nThe fact that a thing was unlawfully and forcefully taken from anotherâs\n rightful possession, as in cases of carnapping, does not automatically \ngive rise to a fortuitous event. To be considered as such, carnapping \nentails more than the mere forceful taking of anotherâs property. It \nmust be proved and established that the event was an act of God or was \ndone solely by third parties and that neither the claimant nor the \nperson alleged to be negligent has any participation. [9] In accordance with the Rules of evidence, the burden of proving that \nthe loss was due to a fortuitous event rests on him who invokes it [10] -\n which in this case is the private respondent. However, other than the \npolice report of the alleged carnapping incident, no other evidence was \npresented by private respondent to the effect that the incident was not \ndue to its fault. A police report of an alleged crime, to which only \nprivate respondent is privy, does not suffice to established the \ncarnapping. Neither does it prove that there was no fault on the part of\n private respondent notwithstanding the partiesâ agreement at the \npre-trial that the car was carnapped. Carnapping does not foreclose the \npossibility of fault or negligence on the part of private respondent.\n\nEven assuming arguendo that carnapping was duly established as a fortuitous event, still private respondent cannot escape liability. Article 1165 [11] of the New Civil Code makes an obligor who is guilty of delay \nresponsible even for a fortuitous event until he has effected the \ndelivery. In this case, private respondent was already in delay as it \nwas supposed to deliver petitionerâs car three (3) days before it was \nlost. Petitionerâs agreement to the rescheduled delivery does not defeat\n his claim as private respondent had already breached its obligation. \nMoreover, such accession cannot be construed as waiver of petitionerâs \nright to hold private respondent liable because the car was unusable and\n thus, petitioner had no option but to leave it.\n\nAssuming further that there was no delay, still working against \nprivate respondent is the legal presumption under Article 1265 that its \npossession of the thing at the time it was lost was due to its fault. [12] This presumption is reasonable since he who has the custody and care of\n the thing can easily explain the circumstances of the loss. The vehicle\n owner has no duty to show that the repair shop was at fault. All that \npetitioner needs to prove, as claimant, is the simple fact that private \nrespondent was in possession of the vehicle at the time it was lost. In \nthis case, private respondentâs possession at the time of the loss is \nundisputed. Consequently, the burden shifts to the possessor who needs \nto present controverting evidence sufficient enough to overcome that \npresumption. Moreover, the exempting circumstances - earthquake, flood, \nstorm or other natural calamity - when the presumption of fault is not \napplicable [13] do not concur \nin this case. Accordingly, having failed to rebut the presumption and \nsince the case does not fall under the exceptions, private respondent is\n answerable for the loss.\n\nIt must likewise be emphasized that pursuant to Articles 1174 and\n 1262 of the New Civil Code, liability attaches even if the loss was due\n to a fortuitous event if âthe nature of the obligation requires the \nassumption of riskâ. [14] Carnapping is a normal business risk for those engaged in the repair of \nmotor vehicles. For just as the owner is exposed to that risk so is the \nrepair shop since the car was entrusted to it. That is why, repair shops\n are required to first register with the Department of Trade and \nIndustry (DTI) [15] and to \nsecure an insurance policy for the âshop covering the property entrusted\n by its customer for repair, service or maintenanceâ as a pre-requisite \nfor such registration/accreditation. [16] Violation of this statutory duty constitutes negligence per se . [17] Having taken custody of the vehicle, private respondent is obliged not \nonly to repair the vehicle but must also provide the customer with some \nform of security for his property over which he loses immediate control.\n An owner who cannot exercise the seven (7) juses or attributes of \nownership â the right to possess, to use and enjoy, to abuse or consume,\n to accessories, to dispose or alienate, to recover or vindicate and to \nthe fruits - [18] is a crippled\n owner. Failure of the repair shop to provide security to a motor \nvehicle owner would leave the latter at the mercy of the former. \nMoreover, on the assumption that private respondentâs repair business is\n duly registered, it presupposes that its shop is covered by insurance \nfrom which it may recover the loss. If private respondent can recover \nfrom its insurer, then it would be unjustly enriched if it will not \ncompensate petitioner to whom no fault can be attributed. Otherwise, if \nthe shop is not registered, then the presumption of negligence applies.\n\nOne last thing. With respect to the value of the lost vehicle and\n its accessories for which the repair shop is liable, it should be based\n on the fair market value that the property would command at the time it\n was entrusted to it or such other value as agreed upon by the parties \nsubsequent to the loss. Such recoverable value is fair and reasonable \nconsidering that the value of the vehicle depreciates. This value may be\n recovered without prejudice to such other damages that a claimant is \nentitled under applicable laws.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the decision of the Court Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the decision of the court a quo is REINSTATED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nRegalado (Chairman), Melo, Puno , and Mendoza, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Registered in the name of petitioner with Plate No. PJK-666.\n\n[2] Rollo, p. 81.\n\n[3] Covered by CBC Receipt No. 691148; Rollo, p. 10.\n\n[4] Rollo, pp. 28-29.\n\n[5] Rollo, p. 29.\n\n[6] The dispositive portion of the trial courtâs decision reads:\n\nâAccordingly, this Court finds the defendant liable to the \nplaintiff for the value of the vehicle in question. Defendant is ordered\n to pay plaintiff the value of the vehicle in the amount of Three \nHundred Thirty Two Thousand Five Hundred Pesos representing the \nacquisition cost of the vehicle plus the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos\n representing the cost of the four brand new tires, magwheels, pioneer \nstereo, speakers, air-conditioner, which were installed by the plaintiff\n in his vehicle after the plaintiff bought the vehicle from the \ndefendant. While it is true that plaintiff purchased from the defendant \nthe vehicle about two years and five months before the same was lost, \nand therefore the vehicle had already depreciated from its original \nvalue at the time it was lost, it is also true as agreed upon by the \nparties in the pre-trial, that the present value of a brand new vehicle \nof the same type has at this time increased to Four Hundred Thousand \nPesos without accessories, so whatever is awarded by this Court to the \nplaintiff in this decision would not even be sufficient to purchase a \nbrand new vehicle at the present prices. This Court believes that the \namount awarded to the plaintiff above-stated represents a fair \ncompromise, considering the depreciation of the vehicle from the time it\n was purchased and to the time it was lost and which is off-seated by \nthe increase cost of a brand new vehicle at the present time. Defendant \nis likewise ordered to pay plaintiff legal interest in the amount \nabove-stated from the date of the finality of this decision until full \npayment of the obligation. Further, defendant is ordered to pay \nplaintiff Ten Thousand Pesos by attorneyâs fees.â (sic was not included \nso as not to clutter the narration); Rollo, pp. 78, 94.\n\n[7] CA Decision \npromulgated August 31, 1995 penned by Justice Austria-Martinez with \nJustices Lantin and Salas, concurring; Rollo, pp. 26-32.\n\n[8] Caltex v.

In the Bergado case (p. 501), \nthe court reiterated the rule that the specific exceptions to the \ngeneral rule to be observed in pre-trials emphasized in Gicano v. \nGegato, 157 SCRA 140 is âthat trial courts have authority and discretion\n to dismiss an action on the ground of prescription when the partiesâ \npleadings or other facts on record show it to be indeed time-barred; and\n it may do so on the basis of a motion to dismiss, or an answer which \nsets up such ground as an affirmative defense; or even if the ground is \nalleged after judgment on the merits, as in a motion for \nreconsideration; or even if the defense has not been asserted at all, as\n where no statement thereof is found in the pleadings, or where a \ndefendant had been declared in default. What is essential only, to \nrepeat, is that the facts demonstrating the lapse of the prescriptive \nperiod, be otherwise sufficiently and satisfactorily apparent on the \nrecord; either in the averments of the plaintiffâs, or otherwise \nestablished by the evidence.\"\n\n[9] Lasam v.
