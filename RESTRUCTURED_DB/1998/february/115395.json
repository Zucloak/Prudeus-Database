NATIONAL LABOR COMMISSION, NATIONAL FEDERATION OF LABOR UNIONS, (NAFLU) AND SALUD GALING, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: Is an employee entitled to back wages during the pendency of her appeal before the NLRC, even if the assailed labor arbiterâs decision did not order her reinstatement? May the NLRC decree back wages where the employeeâs dismissal was legal? The Case The Court answers this questions in the negative granting this petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the October 29, 1993 Resolution[1] of the National Labor Relations Commission[2] (NLRC) which disposed as follows:[3] âWHEREFORE, the assailed Decision is hereby set aside and a new one is entered dismissing the complaint for lack of merit. However, respondents [petitioner herein] are ordered to pay complainant [private respondent herein] her salaries from the date of the filing of the instant appeal on April 10, 1992 up to the date of the promulgation of this Resolution, pursuant to Art. 223 of the Labor Code, as amended.â Petitioners also challenge the NLRCâs Resolution dated February 7, 1994 which denied their subsequent motion for reconsideration, for lack of merit. The labor arbiterâs decision, which the NLRC set aside, in NLRC NCR Case NO. 00-02-01060-91 dated March 10, 1992 disposed as follows:[4] âWHEREFORE, based on the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the dismissal of complainant improper and unjust. Accordingly, respondent is hereby ordered to pay the complainant limited backwages and other benefits for six (6) months in the amount of P18,252.00. Considering however the physical condition of the complainant that was the real cause of her absences and tardiness, it would be to their mutual advantage and most importantly to the physical health welfare of complainant that was the real cause of her absences and tardiness, it would be to their mutual advantage and most importantly to the physical and health welfare of complainant that she is separated from the service with separation benefits equivalent to Â½ month basic salary for every year of service, a fraction of six months equivalent to one year in the amount of P22,815.00. The charge of unfair labor practice is hereby denied for lack of legal basis. Individual respondent Celia Buenconsejo is hereby absolved of any liability for she acted only in her official capacity. Other claims are denied for lack of merit.â The Facts Labor Arbiter Daniel C. Cueto recited the facts of this case as follow:[5] âComplainant is a sewer who started working with respondent in November 1975. She was dismissed for abandonment on February 11, 1991. At the time of her dismissal, she was receiving a salary of P117.00 per day of work. She claimed that while it is true that she was absent from November 30, 1990 up to December 11, 1990, her dismissal on ground of abandonment is not consonance with law considering that her absences was [sic] attributable to chronic ashmatic [sic] bronchitis which she contacted since early 1990 yet. She presented as evidence the medical certificate dated March 4, 1991 attesting for [sic] her medical treatment covering the period January 1990 to May 28, 1990. She claims that her failure to report for work for 11 days was due to sickness wherein respondents were notified by her through the telephone. Complainant argued that she did not abandon her job and that is evidenced by her immediate filing of instant complaint on February 8, 1991. Her 16 years of service, according to complainant, should have been considered by respondents before she was dismissed. She prays for reinstatement plus backwages and also for damages. Respondents contended otherwise. It is their position that complainant was hired on February 5, 1978 and that since the early period of her employment she committed various violations of company rules and regulations ranging from habitual tardiness to frequent absences. Said misdemeanor registered the highest number of tardiness in the second quarter of 1984 numbering 45 times from 37 times in the first quarter of 1984 whereas in terms of monthly tardiness, complainant incurred 21 times in March and June, both in 1990 the said tardiness covered by corresponding memoranda marked as Annexes âAâ to âLâ for respondents, that despite the several warnings given, complainant persisted in her tardiness and frequent absences. By way of evidence, respondent submitted the memorandum (Annex O) giving complainant the stern warning for frequent absenteeism incurred in 1988 numbering 49 absences that affects her performance where the same became worse when she absented for ten (10) days in August 1989, which was subject of another memorandum warning that management shall be constrained to take the necessary drastic action against her due to loss of productive manhours caused by complainantâs excessive absences. Finally, due to complaintâs absences from November 30, 1990 to December 11, 1990 the respondent issued another letter dated December 11, 1990 to complainant (Annex âRâ respondent position paper) requiring her to explain in writing 72 hours why you should not be considered dismisses for having abandoned your job considering that you have been earlier served warning memos for the similar violations.â Respondents stated that despite the said order, it was only on December 19, 1990 that complaint went to the office of respondent to explain. Respondents were forced to terminate complaintâs employment due to her failure to report for work and explain her absence for the straight 20 days without any leave or permission for which reason they considered her continued absence as an abandonment of work.â Declaring âthe dismissal of complainant improper and unjust,â the labor arbiter awarded her âlimited backwages and other benefitsâ plus separation pay equivalent to one half month for every year of service. The labor arbiter did not order her reinstatement, holding that her separation from employment would be to the partiesâ âmutual benefit and most importantly to the physical and health welfare of complainant.â Respondent NLRCâs Ruling On appeal, Respondent NLRC ruled that the dismissal of private respondent was justified. It held, however, that Article 223 of the Labor Code required the reinstatement of private respondent during the pendency of her appeal. Thus, it awarded back wages for the said period when the appeal was pending before it, reasoning as follows:[6] âVerily, respondents-appellants could no longer be faulted when they decided to terminate the services of complainant for her failure to improve her attendance despite repeated warnings. However, pursuant to Art. 223 of the Labor Code, as amended, which provides for mandatory reinstatement whether actual or on payroll, pending appeal, respondent should pay complainant her salaries from the time the appeal was filed on April 10, 1992 up to the date of the promulgation of this Resolution.â Dissatisfied, petitioners lodged this recourse before this Court. In the Resolution[7] dated June 29, 1994, this Court issued a temporary restraining order thus:[8] âNOW, THEREFORE, you (respondents), your officers, agents, representatives, and/or persons acting upon your orders or in your place or stead, are hereby ENJOYED from enforcing or executing the resolutions of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission dated October29, 1993 and February 8, 1994, and in any manner or purpose continuing with the proceedings of the case in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-02-01060-91 entitled âNational Federation of Labor Unions (NAFLU) and Salud Galing vs. Filflex Industrial and Manufacturing Corporation and/or Celia Buenconsejo of the Department of Labor and Employment.â[9] The Issue Petitioners raise a single issue:[10] âx x x. Petitioners submit that the only issue is whether the public respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, in awarding private respondent Galing her salaries from the date of the filing of the appeal on April 10, 1992 up to the date of the promulgation of its Resolution on October 29, 1993, given the undisputed fact of her persistent, repeated, prolonged and contumacious violations of company rules and regulations.â The Courtâs Ruling The petition is meritorious. Sole Issue: Back wages During Pendency of Appeal Petitioners argue that the âsecond paragraph of the dispositive portion of the Decision[11] has no basis in fact or in law.â They assert that âthe decision of Labor Arbiter Cuerto did not call for the reinstatement of [C]omplainant Galing [private respondent herein], [thus] it follows that there is no basis now of this Honorable Commission to Grant her backwages during the period of appeal. Clearly, Article 223 finds no application to the instant case.â[12] They also contend that the assailed Resolution âbecame inconsistent with itself. For while it delared the dismissal of the complainant legal, it ruled nevertheless that [C]omplainant Galing should have been reinstated during the period of the appeal.â[13] Agreeing with the petition, the solicitor general clarifies that Article 223 of the Labor Code is inapplicable to the instant case because Labor Arbiter Cuerto âdid not order the reinstatement of private respondent.â Likewise, the government lawyer agrees that the NLRC Resolution was inherently inconsistent for holding that the dismissal of Complainant Galing was justified and, at the same time, ruling that she should have been reinstated during the pendency of the appeal.[14] On the other hand, the legal department of the NLRC[15] maintains that âreinstatement (pending appeal) whether actual or in payroll is mandatory under Art. 223 of the Codeâ[16] Private respondent adds that under paragraph one, second sentence of the Labor Arbiterâs decision, âthere [was] a call for reinstatement of the complainant because of the backwages granted to her.â[17] We agree with the petitioners and the solicitor general. No Order of Reinstatement The relevant law is Article 223[18] of the Labor Code, which reads: âART. 223. Appeal. â Decision, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders. Such appeal may be entertained only on any of the following grounds: x x x x x x x x x In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal. The employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to her dismissal or separation or, at the option of the employer, merely reinstated in the payroll. The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein. x x x x x x x x xâ (Underscoring supplied.) In other words, reinstatement during appeal is warranted only when the labor arbiter (LA) himself rules that the dismissed employee should be reinstated. In the present case, neither the dispositive portion nor the text of the labor arbiterâs decision ordered the reinstatement of private respondent. Further, the back wages granted to private respondent were specifically limited to the period prior to the filing of the appeal with Respondent NLRC. In fact, the LAâs decision ordered her separation from service for the partiesâ âmutual advantage and most importantly to physical and health welfare of the complainant.â Hence, it is an error and an abuse of discretion for the NLRC to hold that the award of limited back wages, by implication, included an order for private respondentâs reinstatement. An order for reinstatement must be specifically declared and cannot be presumed; like back wages, it is a separate and distinct relief given to an illegally dismissed employee.[19] There being no specific order for reinstatement and the order being for complainantâs separation, there can be no basis for the award of salaries/back wages during the pendency of appeal. NLRC Found Dismissal Justified In addition to the foregoing discussion, there is an equally cogent reason to sustain the petition. Before reinstatement or back wages may be granted, there must be unjust or illegal dismissal from work.[20] The labor arbiter ruled that private respondentâs âabsences and tardiness by itself are sufficient ground for the complainantâs dismissal were it not for reason of sickness which we believe is excusable.â[21] On appeal, however, the NLRC categorically declared that private respondentâs dismissal was wholly justified because her performance was characterized by inefficiency, infractions and absenteeism.[22] Indeed, the records substantiate the following finding of the NLRC: âIt was sufficiently established that complainantâs absences from November 11, 1990 until December 18, 1990 are unauthorized. She never informed the respondent of her whereabouts which naturally worked to the prejudice to her work. Complainantâs assertion that she called-up the respondent by telephone, informing them of state of illness is a bare allegation, unsupported by convincing evidence. This [sic] unauthorized absences left no alternative to the respondent but to seek her explanation on the matter (Rollo p. 48). Complainant, however, did not bother to explain within a reasonable period of time and she only showed-up in the respondentâs office on December 19, 1990. x x x x x x x x x In this particular, complainantâs attitude toward her work is characterized by infractions and inefficiency. It is undisputed that besides her unauthorized absences from November 11, 1990 to December 18, 1990, she previously incurred various offenses. She was frequently late in reporting for work during the following period: First Quarter of 1984 - 37 times Second Quarter of 1984 - 45 times First Quarter of 1985 - 18 times January 1987 - 8 times February 1987 - 8 times March 1987 - 13 times April 1987 - 6 times May 1987 - 13 times June 1987 - 19 times July 1987 - 11 times August 1987 - 7 times October 1987 - 13 times November 1987 - 17 times December 1987 - 19 times January 1988 - 13 times February 1988 - 15 times March 1988 - 9 times April 1988 - 3 times May 1988 - 10 times January 1990 - 11 times March 1990 - 21 times April 1990 - 16 times May 1990 - 19 times June 1990 - 21 times Evidence likewise disclosed that complainant was absent for 10 days during the month of August 1989 and incurred absences without leave on October 6 and 7, 1989, (Rollo, p. 46 to 47). The foregoing infractions show the unsatisfactory work performance of complainant. In the case of Mendoza vs. NLRC, 196 SCRA 606, the Supreme Court held that âthe totality of the infractions that petitioner had committed justifies the penalty of dismissal.â Furthermore, complainant was duly informed of the company rules on absences to the fact that a 7th absence within a calendar year constitute habitual unexcused absence. (Rollo, p. 44). Instead however of improving her attendance, complainant continuously ignored the warnings given her by the respondent. This finds support in the findings of the Labor Arbiter when [sic] ruled that: âx x x All that we can see from the parties pleadings is the fact that complainant have (sic) been incurring tardiness and absences and that despite numerous warnings sent to her in fact numbering 16 all in all from 1989 to 1990, she still persist in incurring absences and tardiness. She had not shown enough improvement on her attendance that last of which was her absences incurred from November 30, 1990 to December 19, 1990 without any justification presented relative to the said absences except the reliance to the certification of her attending physician which was dated March 4, 1991 that she was under treatment of the said doctor from âchronic ashtmatic[sic] bronchitisâ, covering the period of January 19, 1990 to May 28, 1990. While it may be true that complainant was suffering from the alleged sickness, her absences incurred during the period November 30, 1990 up to the time when she reported to explain on December 19, 1990 was not supported by competent proof to rely on.â Since the dismissal of private respondent was deemed valid, she cannot be entitled to reinstatement and back wages.[23] An award of back wages by the NLRC during the period of appeal is totally inconsistent with its finding of a valid dismissal. Additionally, private respondent cannot now be granted separation pay or any other affirmative relief previously awarded to her by the labor arbiter but reversed by the NLRC. Since she did not appeal from the NLRCâs Resolution, she is presumed to be satisfied with the adjudication therein. This is in accord with the doctrine that a party who has not appealed cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the appealed decision.[24] WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby GRANTED. The award of back wages in the assailed NLRC Resolution dated October 29, 1993 is DELETED. The temporary restraining order issued on June 29, 1994 is MADE PERMANENT. No costs. SO ORDERED.

Cueto recited the\nfacts of this case as follow: [5] âComplainant is a sewer who\nstarted working with respondent in November 1975. She was dismissed for abandonment on February 11, 1991. At the time of her dismissal, she was\nreceiving a salary of P 117.00 per day of work. She claimed that while it is true that she was absent from\nNovember 30, 1990 up to December 11, 1990, her dismissal on ground of\nabandonment is not consonance with law considering that her absences was [sic]\nattributable to chronic ashmatic [sic] bronchitis which she contacted since\nearly 1990 yet. She presented as evidence the medical certificate dated March\n4, 1991 attesting for [sic] her medical treatment covering the period January\n1990 to May 28, 1990. She claims that\nher failure to report for work for 11 days was due to sickness wherein\nrespondents were notified by her through the telephone. Complainant argued that she did not abandon\nher job and that is evidenced by her immediate filing of instant complaint on\nFebruary 8, 1991. Her 16 years of\nservice, according to complainant, should have been considered by respondents\nbefore she was dismissed. She prays for\nreinstatement plus backwages and also for damages. Respondents contended\notherwise. It is their position that\ncomplainant was hired on February 5, 1978 and that since the early period of\nher employment she committed various violations of company rules and regulations\nranging from habitual tardiness to frequent absences. Said misdemeanor registered the highest number of tardiness in\nthe second quarter of 1984 numbering 45 times from 37 times in the first\nquarter of 1984 whereas in terms of monthly tardiness, complainant incurred 21\ntimes in March and June, both in 1990 the said tardiness covered by\ncorresponding memoranda marked as Annexes âAâ to âLâ for respondents, that\ndespite the several warnings given, complainant persisted in her tardiness and\nfrequent absences.

Finally, due to complaintâs absences from November 30, 1990 to December\n11, 1990 the respondent issued another letter dated December 11, 1990 to\ncomplainant (Annex âRâ respondent position paper) requiring her to explain in\nwriting 72 hours why you should not be considered dismisses for having\nabandoned your job considering that you have been earlier served warning memos\nfor the similar violations.â Respondents stated that despite the said order, it was only on December\n19, 1990 that complaint went to the office of respondent to explain. Respondents were forced to terminate\ncomplaintâs employment due to her failure to report for work and explain her\nabsence for the straight 20 days without any leave or permission for which\nreason they considered her continued absence as an abandonment of work.â\n\nDeclaring âthe\ndismissal of complainant improper and unjust,â the labor arbiter awarded her âlimited backwages and other\nbenefitsâ plus separation pay equivalent to one half month for every year of\nservice. The labor arbiter did not\norder her reinstatement, holding that her separation from employment would be\nto the partiesâ âmutual benefit and most importantly to the physical and health\nwelfare of complainant.â\n\nRespondent NLRCâs Ruling\n\nOn appeal,\nRespondent NLRC ruled that the dismissal of private respondent was justified. It held, however, that Article 223 of the\nLabor Code required the reinstatement of private respondent during the pendency\nof her appeal. Thus, it awarded back\nwages for the said period when the appeal was pending before it, reasoning as\nfollows: [6] âVerily,\nrespondents-appellants could no longer be faulted when they decided to\nterminate the services of complainant for her failure to improve her attendance\ndespite repeated warnings.

For while it delared the dismissal of the complainant legal, it ruled\nnevertheless that [C]omplainant Galing should have been reinstated during the period\nof the appeal.â [13]\n\nAgreeing with\nthe petition, the solicitor general clarifies that Article 223 of the Labor\nCode is inapplicable to the instant case because Labor Arbiter Cuerto âdid not\norder the reinstatement of private respondent.â Likewise, the government lawyer agrees that the NLRC Resolution\nwas inherently inconsistent for holding that the dismissal of Complainant\nGaling was justified and, at the same time, ruling that she should have been\nreinstated during the pendency of the appeal. [14]\n\nOn the other\nhand, the legal department of the NLRC [15] maintains that âreinstatement\n(pending appeal) whether actual or in payroll is mandatory under Art. 223 of\nthe Codeâ [16]\n\nPrivate\nrespondent adds that under paragraph one, second sentence of the Labor\nArbiterâs decision, âthere [was] a call for reinstatement of the complainant\nbecause of the backwages granted to her.â [17]\n\nWe agree with\nthe petitioners and the solicitor general.\n\nNo Order of Reinstatement\n\nThe relevant law\nis Article 223 [18] of the Labor Code, which reads: âART. 223. Appeal. â Decision, awards, or orders of the\nLabor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any\nor both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions,\nawards, or orders. Such appeal may be\nentertained only on any of the following grounds:\n\nx x x x x\nx x x\nx In any event, the\ndecision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect\nis concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal. The employee shall either be admitted back\nto work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to her dismissal\nor separation or, at the option of the employer, merely reinstated in the\npayroll. The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution\nfor reinstatement provided herein .\n\nx x x x x\nx x x\nxâ (Underscoring supplied.)\n\nIn other words,\nreinstatement during appeal is warranted only when the labor arbiter (LA)\nhimself rules that the dismissed employee should be reinstated. In the present case, neither the dispositive\nportion nor the text of the labor arbiterâs decision ordered the reinstatement\nof private respondent. Further, the\nback wages granted to private respondent were specifically limited to the\nperiod prior to the filing of the appeal with Respondent NLRC. In fact, the LAâs decision ordered her\nseparation from service for the partiesâ âmutual advantage and most importantly\nto physical and health welfare of the complainant.â Hence, it is an error and an abuse of discretion for the NLRC to\nhold that the award of limited back wages, by implication, included an order\nfor private respondentâs reinstatement.\n\nAn order for\nreinstatement must be specifically declared and cannot be presumed; like back\nwages, it is a separate and distinct relief given to an illegally dismissed\nemployee. [19] There being no specific order for\nreinstatement and the order being for complainantâs separation, there can be no\nbasis for the award of salaries/back wages during the pendency of appeal.\n\nNLRC Found\nDismissal Justified\n\nIn addition to the foregoing discussion, there\nis an equally cogent reason to sustain the petition. Before reinstatement or back wages may be granted, there must be\nunjust or illegal dismissal from work. [20] The labor arbiter ruled that\nprivate respondentâs âabsences and tardiness by itself are sufficient ground\nfor the complainantâs dismissal were it not for reason of sickness which we\nbelieve is excusable.â [21] On appeal, however, the NLRC\ncategorically declared that private respondentâs dismissal was wholly justified\nbecause her performance was characterized by inefficiency, infractions and\nabsenteeism. [22] Indeed, the records substantiate\nthe following finding of the NLRC: âIt was sufficiently\nestablished that complainantâs absences from November 11, 1990 until December\n18, 1990 are unauthorized. She never\ninformed the respondent of her whereabouts which naturally worked to the prejudice\nto her work. Complainantâs assertion\nthat she called-up the respondent by telephone, informing them of state of\nillness is a bare allegation, unsupported by convincing evidence. This [sic] unauthorized absences left no\nalternative to the respondent but to seek her explanation on the matter ( Rollo p. 48). Complainant, however, did not\nbother to explain within a reasonable period of time and she only showed-up in\nthe respondentâs office on December 19, 1990.\n\nx x x x x\nx x x\nx In this particular,\ncomplainantâs attitude toward her work is characterized by infractions and\ninefficiency. It is undisputed that\nbesides her unauthorized absences from November 11, 1990 to December 18, 1990,\nshe previously incurred various offenses. She was frequently late in reporting for work during the following\nperiod:\n\nFirst Quarter of 1984 - 37 times\n\nSecond Quarter of 1984 - 45 times\n\nFirst Quarter of 1985 - 18 times\n\nJanuary 1987 - 8 times\n\nFebruary 1987 - 8 times\n\nMarch 1987 - 13 times\n\nApril 1987 - 6 times\n\nMay 1987 - 13 times\n\nJune 1987 - 19 times\n\nJuly 1987 - 11 times\n\nAugust 1987 - 7 times\n\nOctober 1987 - 13 times\n\nNovember 1987 - 17 times\n\nDecember 1987 - 19 times\n\nJanuary 1988 - 13 times\n\nFebruary 1988 - 15 times\n\nMarch 1988 - 9 times\n\nApril 1988 - 3 times\n\nMay 1988 - 10 times\n\nJanuary 1990 - 11 times\n\nMarch 1990 - 21 times\n\nApril 1990 - 16 times\n\nMay 1990 - 19 times\n\nJune 1990 - 21 times Evidence\nlikewise disclosed that complainant was absent for 10 days during the month of\nAugust 1989 and incurred absences without leave on October 6 and 7, 1989, ( Rollo ,\np. 46 to 47). The foregoing infractions\nshow the unsatisfactory work performance of complainant. In the case of Mendoza vs . NLRC, 196 SCRA\n606, the Supreme Court held that âthe totality of the infractions that\npetitioner had committed justifies the penalty of dismissal.â Furthermore, complainant was duly informed\nof the company rules on absences to the fact that a 7 th absence within a calendar\nyear constitute habitual unexcused absence. ( Rollo , p. 44). Instead however of improving her attendance,\ncomplainant continuously ignored the warnings given her by the respondent. This finds support in the findings of the Labor\nArbiter when [sic] ruled that:\n\nâx x x All that we can see\nfrom the parties pleadings is the fact that complainant have (sic) been\nincurring tardiness and absences and that despite numerous warnings sent to her\nin fact numbering 16 all in all from 1989 to 1990, she still persist in\nincurring absences and tardiness. She\nhad not shown enough improvement on her attendance that last of which was her\nabsences incurred from November 30, 1990 to December 19, 1990 without any\njustification presented relative to the said absences except the reliance to\nthe certification of her attending physician which was dated March 4, 1991 that\nshe was under treatment of the said doctor from âchronic ashtmatic[sic]\nbronchitisâ, covering the period of January 19, 1990 to May 28, 1990. While it may be true that complainant was\nsuffering from the alleged sickness, her absences incurred during the period\nNovember 30, 1990 up to the time when she reported to explain on December 19,\n1990 was not supported by competent proof to rely on.â\n\nSince the\ndismissal of private respondent was deemed valid, she cannot be entitled to\nreinstatement and back wages. [23] An award of back wages by the NLRC\nduring the period of appeal is totally inconsistent with its finding of a valid\ndismissal.\n\nAdditionally,\nprivate respondent cannot now be granted separation pay or any other\naffirmative relief previously awarded to her by the labor arbiter but reversed\nby the NLRC. Since she did not appeal\nfrom the NLRCâs Resolution, she is presumed to be satisfied with the\nadjudication therein. This is in accord\nwith the doctrine that a party who has not appealed cannot obtain from the\nappellate court any affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the\nappealed decision. [24]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is hereby\nGRANTED. The award of back wages in the\nassailed NLRC Resolution dated October 29, 1993 is DELETED. The temporary restraining order issued on\nJune 29, 1994 is MADE PERMANENT. No\ncosts.\n\nSO ORDERED.
