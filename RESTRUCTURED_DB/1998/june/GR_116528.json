Nos. 115657-59, June 26, 1998 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO STA. ANA Y TUPIG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO STA. ANA Y TUPIG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nA rape case presents a âhe said, she saidâ scenario. In this \nappeal, the Court is tasked to decide whom to believe -- the appellant \nor the private complainant? This is not an easy undertaking. On the one \nhand, the Court has to keep in mind that a rape victim is a victim many \ntimes over. She is physically, psychologically, emotionally and socially\n scarred. Oftentimes she suffers in silence, and this may last a \nlifetime. Justice must be rendered to her. On the other hand, the Court \nmust also remember that an accusation of rape can be made with facility,\n and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even harder for \nthe accused, though innocent, to disprove. [1] The charge of rape must be proven with moral certainty, lest there be a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe Case\n\nDomingo Sta. Ana was charged with rape committed on three \ndifferent occasions against Judilyn Obera. Before the Regional Trial \nCourt of Kalookan City, Branch 120, three Criminal Complaints, treated \nas Informations, [2] were filed\n against him on August 10, 1992, setting forth identical allegations \nsave for the dates of the commission of the offenses:\n\nâThat on or about the 22nd day of April 1992 (in Criminal Case No. 40645) [3] ,\n in Kalookan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this \nHonorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design and by means \nof threats and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and\n feloniously lie and have sexual intercourse with JUDILYN OBERA Y \nPROVIDO a minor of 12 years of age (11 years of age in Criminal Case No.\n 40647) against her will and without her consent.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.â [4]\n\nOn arraignment, the appellant, with the assistance of Counsel de Oficio Ernesto Gaboy, [5] pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. The three criminal \ncases were jointly tried and, thereafter, the trial court rendered a \nDecision dated April 22, 1994, finding him guilty beyond reasonable \ndoubt of three counts of rape. The dispositive portion of the assailed \nDecision [6] reads:\n\nâWHEREFORE, finding that the prosecution evidence established the \nguilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in the three (3) crimes of \nrape, the Court hereby imposes [the] penalty of [r]eclusion [p]erpetua \nfor each rape committed by the accused as provided under Article 335 of \nthe Revised Penal Code and to indemnify the offended party the sum of \nP50,000.00.\n\nSO ORDERED.â [7]\n\nHence, this appeal. [8]\n\nThe Facts\nThe Version of the Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution presented five witnesses: Judilyn Obera, [9] the complainant; Margarita Obera, [10] mother of the complainant who testified to the victimâs age; SPO1 Leonardo Balinang, [11] one of the four policemen who apprehended the appellant and brought him to the police station; SPO3 Bienvenido Santianes, [12] the investigating officer who received the complaint, took down \ncomplainantâs sworn statement and sent the team which arrested the \nappellant; and Dr. Juan B. Zaldariaga, Jr., [13] the NBI medico-legal officer who examined the victim.\n\nThe solicitor general summarized the Peopleâs version of the facts as follows:\n\nâOn November 28, 1991, at around 6:30 in the evening, private \ncomplainant Judilyn Obera, who was born on February 11, 1980, was \nwalking along Lawaan Alley, Macaneneng Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan \nCity towards her house at 69 Miralle Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan \nCity when appellant Domingo Sta. Ana saw her and pulled her towards \nappellantâs house which is located at 233 Lawaan Alley, Bagong Barrio of\n the same city. Appellant then poked a knife at Judilynâs neck, covered \nher mouth with a handkerchief and, thereafter, raped her. Judilyn cried \nbecause of the severe pain she felt. After raping Judilyn, appellant \nthreatened her not to tell anybody about the incident, or else, he would\n kill her as well as her parents, brothers and sisters (Exh. âBâ, p. \n159, Records; tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, pp. 3-5 and 13).\n\nOn February 17, 1992, at around 7:00 in the evening, Judilyn was at\n her house when Didel Sta. Ana, appellantâs daughter and friend of \nJudilyn, called and told Judilyn to help her in preparing barbecue. \nHowever, when Judilyn went to Didelâs house (she lives with appellant), \nthe latter was not in the house as she had left already. Appellant, who \nwas in the house, called Judilyn and suddenly poked a knife at her neck.\n Appellant then embraced Judilyn, kissed her lips and ears and pulled \ndown her panties. He then took off his pants and had sexual intercourse \nwith her for about five minutes. Thereafter, appellant told Judilyn to \nwait on one of the chairs inside the house for another five minutes and \nthen told her to go home. Appellant also threatened to kill Judilyn \n(tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, pp. 4-7).\n\nOn April 22, 1992, Didel Sta. Ana invited Judilyn to see a movie. \nDidel told private complainant that the formerâs father, appellant, was \nnot going with them. However, when Judilyn met with Didel, the latter \nwas with appellant. When told by Didel that appellant would not sit \nbeside her, Judilyn finally agreed to see a movie with Didel and \nappellant. Thereafter, at around 7:00 in the evening and after watching a\n movie, Judilyn went with Didel and appellant to the latterâs house. \nAppellant then sent her [sic] daughter Didel to the market for an \nerrand. After Didel left, appellant poked a knife at Judilynâs neck and \nthreatened to kill her if she would tell anybody about the incident. He \nthen pulled down her panties and took off his pants and his briefs. \nAppellant had Judilyn sit on a chair and then had sexual intercourse \nwith her. Appellant then told Judilyn to go home (tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, \np.4, 7-9; tsn., Jan. 14, 1993, pp. 9 and 15).\n\nJudilyn kept the three rape incidents to herself because she was \nafraid of the threats made by the appellant (tsn., Jan. 14, 1993, pp. \n10-11).\n\nHowever, on July 23, 1992, something happened which forced Judilyn \nto tell her parents about the rape incidents. Judilynâs parents were \nwondering why the formerâs stomach was getting large, thus prompting the\n latter to bring their daughter to an âalbularyoâ to determine whether \nprivate complainant was pregnant or not. When informed by the \nâalbularyoâ that she was pregnant, Judilyn thereupon told her parents \nthat she was raped by the appellant (tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, p. 9; tsn., \nJan. 14, 1993, p. 12).\n\nThereafter, three (3) separate complaints for rape were filed \nagainst appellant (Exhs. âIâ, âJâ and âKâ; tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, pp. \n10-11). On December 14, 1992, Judilyn gave birth (tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, p.\n 9).â\n\nThe Version of the Defense\n\nAppellant Sta. Ana contends that he could not have committed the \npurported rapes against Private Complainant Obera because she was the \nfriend of his daughter [14] and, on the dates of the alleged rapes, he was at his barbecue stall. [15] He adds that he was forced by the police to admit the accusation \nagainst him and that, while he was in the custody of the lawmen, he was \nnot allowed to secure his own counsel.\n\nDuring the trial, the defense presented three witnesses: the \nappellant himself, who denied the charges; Beatriz Doktor, a balut \nvendor who testified that, on the dates of the alleged rapes, appellant \nwas vending beside her in Macaneneng Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan \nCity; and Didel Sta. Ana, appellantâs daughter who was also the \ncomplainantâs best friend.\n\nIn his Brief, [16] appellant submitted the following Statement of Facts:\n\nâ1. Accused-Appellant is a widower, 47 years old, \nwith three grown children, whose main source of livelihood was vending \nmeat barbecue in the neighborhood of Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City (TSN \nof the direct examination of Accused-Appellant dated 01 February 1994, \nat p. 2).\n\n2. On 06 August 1996, while walking along Makaneneng Street, \nBagong Barrio, Kalookan City, Accused-Appellant was accosted by four \npolicemen from Bagong Barrio Police Station. The policemen, after having\n ascertained his identity, informed him that someone filed a complaint \nof rape against him (TSN of testimony of SPO1 Leonardo Balinang, 06 \nOctober 1992, at p. 4).\n\n3. Immediately, Accused-Appellant was handcuffed, forced to board \nthe police service vehicle and brought by the apprehending policemen to \nthe police station (TSN, 01 February 1994, at p. 4).\n\n4. Upon arrival at the police station, the Accused-Appellant was \ninterrogated by said policemen, who forced him to admit to the \naccusations of Ms. Judilyn Obera. Accused-Appellant insisted on his \ninnocence. He was punched on the stomach and at the back (TSN, supra, p.\n 4); thereafter, he was brought inside a cell and was not allowed to \nleave, except only to appear before the inquest prosecutor the following\n day, 07 August 1993, for inquest proceedings (TSN of cross-examination \nof SPO3 Bienvenido Santianes, Jr, 07 October 1992, at p. 9).\n\n5. All the while that he was under the custody of the police, \nAccused-Appellant was not allowed to secure his own counsel; neither was\n he given the assistance of one. (TSN, 06 October 1992, at p. 7).\n\n6. Subsequently, three separate Informations for rape were filed \nagainst him in the court a quo docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 40645, \n40646 and 40647.\n\n7. During the trial, the prosecution presented the following \nwitnesses: Margarita Obera, the mother of the complainant, who testified\n as to the victimâs age; SPO1 Leonardo Balinang, one of the four \npolicemen who apprehended Accused-Appellant and brought him to the \npolice station; SPO3 Bienvenido Santianes, the investigating officer who\n received the complaint, took down the sworn statement of the \ncomplainant and sent the team which arrested the Accused-Appellant; the \ncomplainant, Judilyn Obera; and Dr. Juan Zaldariaga, the NBI \nmedico-legal officer who examined the complainant and who testified as \nto the physical condition of the victim as of 03 August 1992, the date \nof medical examination.\n\n8. On the other hand, the defense presented Accused-Appellant \nhimself who denied the charges; Beatriz Doktor, a balut vendor who \ntestified that on the dates of the alleged rapes, Accused-Appellant was \nvending beside her in Macaneneng Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City; \nand Didel Sta. Ana, Accused-Appellantâs daughter who was also the \ncomplainantâs best friend.\n\n9. After trial, Accused-Appellant was convicted by the trial court and sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua .â\n\nThe trial court, on the other hand, presented the following summary of the evidence of the defense:\n\nâEvidence for the defense, as per testimony of the accused, Domingo\n Sta. Ana, shows that he is a vendor residing at 233 Lawaan Alley, \nBagong Barrio, Kalookan City. As a vendor, he woke up everyday at 5;00 \noâ clock in the morning to go to the market at Balintawak to buy meat \nfor barbecue. He went home at 6:30 in the morning to prepare the \nbarbecue and finished at 3:00 in the afternoon. At 4:30 in the \nafternoon, he started selling in Bagong Barrio and went home at 11:00 oâ\n clock in the evening.\n\nOn August 7, 1992, he was caught by the police and brought to the \nprecinct. They were forcing him to admit the crime and when he refused, \nthey maltreated him. There was no investigation that took place and \nthere was no lawyer who assisted him.\n\nHe further testified that on November 28, 1991, February 17, 1992 \nand April 22, 1992, a balut vendor was beside him when he was vending.\n\nBeatriz Doktor, a balut vendor, testified that on November 28, \n1991, February 17, 1992 and April 22, 1992, she and the accused were \nvending from 6:30 in the evening to 12 midnight.\n\nDidel Sta. Ana, daughter of the accused, testified that everyday, \nshe helped her father in preparing barbecue and in selling them at Peta \nStreet. Her father started vending from 5:00 oâ clock in the afternoon \nand went home at 12:00 midnight. In 1991, every night, the victim and \nher brother bought barbecue in their store. Sometime in January, 1992, \nthe victim told her that her (victim) birthday was lonely because her \nbrother did something wrong to her. She told the victim to tell her \nparents what happened to her but she did not tell her parents.\n\nShe further testified that in 1992, the victim stop[ped] going [to]\n their store. She came to know that the victim was pregnant when she was\n informed by the victimâs brother. One time, she saw the victim [pass \nby] their store and noticed that the latter like[d] to eat sour foods. \nShe heard from the brother of the victim that their mother noticed that \nthe victimâs neck became darker and her stomach [was] getting bigger. \nShe was brought by her mother to a quack doctor (nagtatawas).\n\nShe declared that the victim Judilyn Obera Y Provido was her \nchildhood friend and that on April 22, 1992, she and her father were in \ntheir house ânagtutuhog ng barbecueâ (t.s.n., p. 11, February 23, \n1994).â [17]\n\nThe Ruling of the Trial Court\n\nThe lower court gave full credence and probative weight to the \nevidence of the prosecution, especially to that of the victim, Judilyn \nObera. Pertinent portions of the Decision are reproduced below:\n\nâOn the first rape, the private complainant has described in a \nclear, straightforward manner the details how the accused forced her \ninside the house, then poked a knife at her neck, removed her panty and \ninserted his penis into her vagina. She said that she cried because of \nthe pain which was the natural reaction for a virgin like the private \ncomplainant for she was only less than 12 years old at that time.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe second alleged rape was committed when she was called by Didel \nto go to the house but when the private complainant arrived in the \nhouse, Didel was not in the house Then and there, the accused embraced \nher on the lips and ears and then pulled her party and insert[ed] his \npenis into the vagina for about five (5) minutes. He threatened her that\n he would kill her and her family if she would tell her parents about \nthe incident and the third time was on April 22, 1992 at 7:00 oâ clock \nin the evening, again inside the house. The accused forced the private \ncomplainant as he pulled down her panty, took off his pants and brief \nand insert[ed] his penis and he ordered her to sit down on the chair and\n the accused inserted his penis into her vagina four (4) times.\n\nThere is no doubt in the courtâs mind that physical force and fear \nhad overcome without much difficulty the 12 year old victimâs \nresistance. Details of the sexual intercourse as she was forced to sit \ndown on the chair could only come from one who was indeed ravished in \nthe manner so described.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nOne is hard put to believe that a[s] young and inexperience[d] as \nthe complainant was, [she] would willingly and voluntarily accept the \nbestial advances of the accused unless she was at that time forced or \nintimidated by the accused.\n\nThe defense of the accused is alibi which is unavailing in view of \nthe positive identification of the accused and the fact that the store \nfrom where he was selling his goods to the house where the rape was \ncommitted, was only about 2 to 3 minutes walk.\n\nWell settled is the rule that for alibi to be accorded credence, it\n does not suffice for an accused to merely prove that he was at some \nother place, but that the distance was such render it physically \nimpossible for him to be at the scene of the crime shortly before, \nduring or after it was committed.â [18]\n\nAssignment of Errors\n\nThe appellant submits that the Decision of the trial court \nâshould be reversed and set aside because the following circumstances \nwill show that the guilt of the accused has not been proven beyond \nreasonable doubtâ: [19]\n\nâA. The conduct of the complainant before and after \nthe alleged sexual assaults belied that she was raped by \naccused-appellant, based on human experience.\n\nB. The alleged dates of the rape did not coincide with the age of the fetus.\n\nC. The complainant had the motive to cry rape to salvage her sullied reputation brought about by a pregnancy at a tender age.\n\nD. The complainantâs credibility is lacking, especially in her identification of the accused.â\n\nAt the core of this case is the credibility of the private \ncomplainant, Judilyn Obera, upon whose testimony the appellant was \nconvicted.\n\nThe Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe appeal is bereft of merit.\n\nFirst Issue:\nComplainantâs Conduct and Her Credibility\n\nThe general rule is that the findings of the trial court on the \ncredibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest respect and will \nnot be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any clear showing that the \ntrial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or \ncircumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the \nresult of the case. [20] This \nis so because the trial court is in a better position to decide the \nquestion of credibility, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves \nand observed their behavior and manner of testifying. [21]\n\nIt must be noted too that, in the review of rape cases such as \nthis one, jurisprudence has laid down the following guiding principles:\n\nâ(a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility \nand while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more \ndifficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove the \ncharge;\n\n(b) considering that, in the nature of things, only \ntwo (2) persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony\n of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and\n\n(c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own \nmerit, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the \nevidence for the defense.â [22]\n\nAs earlier stated, the trial court gave credence to testimony of the \ncomplainant that she was raped by the appellant thrice and that, on each\n occasion, he poked a knife at her as he threatened that she and her \nfamily would be harmed, should she tell anyone of the incident. We \nsustain the assessment by the trial court of the complainantâs \ntestimony, which we find to be clear, credible and straightforward. The \ncomplainant testified as follows :\n\nâQ xxx now you stated that sometime on November 28, 1991, you \nwere raped by Domingo Sta. Ana at his house[. W]here is that place \nlocated?\n\nA At 233 Lawaan Alley, sir.\n\nQ What is that municipality of that barrio or baranggay [sic]?\n\nA Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City, sir.\n\nQ What time were you raped by the accused?\n\nA 6:30, sir.\n\nQ In the morning or evening?\n\nA In the evening, sir.\n\nQ Can you tell the Honorable Court why were you at that place at about 6:30 in the evening on November 28, 1991?\n\nA While I was walking going to our house at Lawaan Alley, \nMacaneneng Street, Kalookan City, he saw me and pulled me towards his \nhouse, sir.\n\nQ What happened when he pulled you towards his house?\n\nA He poked a knife on my neck.\n\nQ What happened after the knife was placed on your neck?\n\nA And then he inserted his penis into my vagina, sir.\n\nQ For how long?\n\nA For several minutes, sir.\n\nQ Can you tell the Honorable Court your feeling, if any, when [you] said that his sexual organ was inserted in your vagina?\n\nA I cried because of the severe pain that I felt, sir.\n\nQ After the accused ha[d] already his penis inside your vagina, what happened next?\n\nA After he was finished, he threatened me that he will kill me, sir.\n\nQ What did he do later or afterwards?\n\nA After he said that, he also told me that he would also include my parents as well as my brothers and sisters, sir.\n\nQ What do you mean include?\n\nA That he would also kill them, sir.\n\nQ For what reason?\n\nA If I will tell the incident in our place.\n\nQ What incident are you talking about?\n\nA About the rape he committed against me, sir.\n\nQ You also stated that sometime last February 17, 1992, the \nsaid accused also raped you[.

Ana molested or raped you[. C]an you tell where \nthis molestation or rape took place?\n\nA In their house, sir.\n\nQ What time?\n\nA About 7:00 oâ clock, sir.\n\nQ Why were you there at about 7:00 oâ clock in the evening on April 22, 1992?\n\nA Idel and I came from a movie.\n\nQ The same daughter that you were saying before who called you?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nxxx \n xxx \n xxx\n\nQ You said that on the evening at about 7:00 oâ clock, you were raped[. W]as the daughter present when you were raped?\n\nA She was no longer there, sir.\n\nQ How about you, where were you then?\n\nA I was in their house and I was left by [his] daughter, sir.\n\nQ When you were left at their house by the daughter of the accused, Domingo Sta. Ana, what happened there, if any?\n\nA He poked a knife on my neck, sir.\n\nQ After that, what happened?\n\nA He threatened me that he will kill me, sir.\n\nQ For what?\n\nA If I will tell the incident in our place and to anybody, sir.\n\nQ Why, what happened at that evening?\n\nA After that, he pulled down my panty, sir.\n\nQ What happened after he has pulled down your panty?\n\nA Then after[wards] he took off his pants and his brief, sir.\n\nQ What happened after his brief was already pulled out?\n\nA He inserted his penis into my vagina, sir.\n\nQ What was his position and your position?\n\nA He told me to sit down on one of their chairs, sir.\n\nQ When he said that, was the knife still poked on your neck?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ Now, on April 22, 1992, you said that Domingo Sta.

Ana do to you, if any?\n\nA He inserted again his penis into my vagina, sir.\n\nQ Did you feel the penetration of his penis into your vagina[?]\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ Can you tell us how this was done, how many times did he go inside and outside your vagina?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ How many times, more or less.\n\nA About four times, sir.\n\nx x xâ [23]\n\nThe rule is that âan affirmative testimony is far stronger than a \nnegative testimony, especially so when it comes from the mouth of a \ncredible witness.â [24] Appellant has not given us a sufficient justification to modify or \nreverse the findings of the trial court, and we find none in the \nrecords.\n\nAppellant argues that it is âsimply contrary to human nature and \nexperience for the complainant to return not just once but twice to the \nhouse of the accused-appellant where she was allegedly raped the first \ntime, assuming that she was indeed raped earlier, on 28 November 1991. \nAt her tender age and suffering from intense pain as claimed by her, she\n should have been traumatized by the initial experience. Yet, \ncomplainant went to the same house barely three months later.â [25] The appellant also questions private complainantâs watching a movie \nwith him and returning to his house on April 22, 1992, the date of the \nalleged third rape. He cites People vs. Castillon , [26] which held that the conduct of the victim immediately following the \nalleged sexual assault is of utmost importance to establish the truth or\n falsity of the charge of rape, and that the ânormal human reaction \nwould be for the victim to take flight at the first opportunity to avoid\n her tormentors.â Appellant also emphasizes the fact that Judilyn did \nnot tell anyone -- her parents, in particular -- of the alleged \ninstances of rape. This, appellant argues, casts doubt on the veracity \nof her story. [27]\n\nThis argument does not persuade. In People vs. Montefalcon , [28] the Court said: âWe have had occasion to state and reiterate that \ndifferent people react differently to a given situation or type of \nsituation, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response \nwhere one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful \nexperience.â In that case, the appellant was convicted of four counts of\n rape committed against a ten-year-old girl. He argued, just as \nAppellant Sta. Ana now argues, that the trial court erred in giving \ncredence to the victimâs testimony, which he described as conflicting \nand improbable, and that the actions of the victim after the alleged \nrapes were not âthe normal behavior of a girl whose virtue has been \ndamaged.â [29] The Court, \nhowever, held that the victimâs failure to tell her parents more \npromptly of the sexual assaults upon her did not, by itself, diminish \nher credibility, and that âit is not uncommon for young girls to conceal\n for sometime the assaults on their virtues because of the rapistâs \nthreat on their lives.â [30]\n\nIn People vs. Remoto , [31] the Court ruled: âSuffice to stress, it is not proper to judge the \nactions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences by the \nnorms of behavior expected under the circumstances from mature persons. \nThe range of emotion shown by rape victims is yet to be captured even by\n the calculus. It is thus unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from \nrape victims.â [32]\n\nVerily, the private complainant adequately explained her conduct in going twice to the scene of the crime after the first rape:\n\nâQ Can you tell also why you were there at that time about 7:00 of February 17, 1992?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ Why were you there?\n\nA I was called up by his daughter, Idel, sir.\n\nQ For what purpose?\n\nA She told me to help her in preparing the barbecue, sir.\n\nQ What is your relationship with the daughter named Idel?\n\nA She is my friends [sic], sir.â [33]\n\nOn cross-examination, she further testified:\n\nâQ After the rape on November 28, 1991 and after the rape on \nFebruary 17, 1992, despite the threats that you testified [to] before \nthis Court by the accused, why did you agree to go with the accused and \nhis daughter to the theater on April 22, 1992?\n\nA Because his daughter Aileen told me that only the two of us will watch the movie .\n\nQ But before you entered the movie house you met the accused[. I]s that correct?\n\nA Yes, your Honor.\n\nQ Considering that you testified that the accused threaten[ed] \nyou during the two alleged rapes, why did you agree to go inside the \ntheater with the accused after you ha[d] seen him?\n\nA I do [sic] not really want to go inside the \nmovie house at that time, your Honor, but his daughter told me that his \nfather [would] not sit beside me, your Honor â. [34]\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing that Judilyn went back to the scene of the crime twice because of Didel, [35] the daughter of the appellant who was her childhood friend, a fact which even the latter admitted. [36]\n\nThat Judilyn did not immediately inform anyone, especially her \nparents, about any of the incidents of rape can be attributed to the \nappellantâs threats which, to her mind, were very real:\n\nâQ Judilyn, will you kindly tell us the reason, if any, why you \ndid not tell your parents that you were raped by the accused herein on \nNovember 28, 1991?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ Why, what was your reason for not telling your parents?\n\nA Because I was afraid, sir.\n\nQ Afraid of what?\n\nA I was afraid [of] his threat against me, sir.\n\nQ Who gave that threat to you, and what was the threat all about?\n\nA Domingo Sta. Ana, sir.\n\nQ The accused?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And what was his threat?\n\nA He told me that if I am going to tell the incident to my \nparents, he will kill me together with my parents and brothers and \nsisters, sir.\n\nQ And when he said those threatening words, did you believe him?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ Why did you believe him?\n\nA Because he was holding a knife at that time, sir.\n\nQ On this day, November 28, 1991, how old were you, exactly?\n\nA 11 years old, sir.\n\nQ Regarding also the incident on February 16, 1992 when you \nwere again raped by the accused in this case, will you tell the \nHonorable Court if you told your parents regarding the incidents?\n\nA No, sir.\n\nQ On this date, February 17, 1992, were both your parents in your house?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ What was the threat, if any, that the accused again told you?\n\nA He told me that he will kill me if I will tell the incident to my parents, sir.\n\nQ And again, did you believe him when he said those words?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ Why did you believe him?\n\nA Because he was holding a knife at that time, sir.\n\nQ On April 22, 1992, when the third raped [sic] took place, were you able to tell your parents about the incident?\n\nA No, sir.\n\nQ Why?\n\nA Because he made threats against me, sir. He told me that if I will tell the incident to my parents, he will kill me, sir.\n\nQ On February 17, 1992 and on April 22, 1992, how old were you, respectively?\n\nA 12 years old, sir.\n\nQ Now, did you ever tell your parents how this raped [sic] took\n place on November 28, 1991, February 17, 1992, April 22, 1992 which was\n perpetuated by the accused in this case?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ When was the time you told them?\n\nA July 23, sir.\n\nQ What year?\n\nA 1992, sir.\n\nQ What made you finally [tell] your parents?\n\nA When we went to the âalbularyoâ, sir.\n\nQ For what purpose?\n\nA Because they wanted to know whether or not I [was] pregnant at that time, sir.â [37]\n\nIt is important to note that delay in reporting rape does not by \nitself undermine the charge, where the delay is grounded on death \nthreats from the accused. [38]\n\nSecond Issue:\nRape and Pregnancy\n\nAppellant cites Dr. Juan Zaldariaga, Jr., the NBI medico-legal \nofficer who testified that the age of the fetus at the time of Judilynâs\n examination was eighteen (18) weeks and two (2) days, a finding that \nwas confirmed by ultrasound. [39] He averred:\n\nâFrom the foregoing medical findings and testimony, it is clear \nthat the complainantâs pregnancy was eighteen (18) weeks and two days \n(2) days in term when she was examined on 03 August 1992. It follows \nthat she could not have been impregnated [i]n the alleged rape on 28 \nNovember 1991, or on 22 April 1992, because, if that were so, she would \nhave been at least thirty-five weeks pregnant counted from 28 November \n1991, or only fourteen (14) weeks counted from the date of the second \nrape on 22 April 1992. Similarly, it cannot be claimed that the \ncomplainant was impregnated when she was allegedly raped on 17 February \n1992, because she would have been pregnant for about twenty-four (24) \nweeks. [40]\n\nIn People vs. Adora , [41] the appellant argued that the medical finding showed that the \ncomplainant was already pregnant long before she was allegedly abused. \nAddressing this contention, the Court turned to the dissertations of \nexperts in the field and held that: [42] â[A]uthorities in forensic medicine agree that the determination of the\n exact date of fertilization is problematic. The exact date thereof is \nunknown; thus, the difficulty in determining the actual normal duration \nof pregnancy.â [43] Citing a \nFilipino authority, the Court further elucidated: âThe average duration \nof pregnancy is 270 to 280 days from the onset of the last menstruation. There is, however, no means of determining it with certainty . \nEvidence derived from pregnancy following a single coitus is \ntrustworthy, but inasmuch as some authorities consider more than two \nweeks as the life span of the spermatozoa in the vaginal canal, it is \nhard to ascertain the exact date of fertilization. There is no synchrony between coitus and fertilization .â [44]\n\nEven Dr. Zaldariaga, on redirect examination, implied that his finding on the age of the fetus was not conclusive. [45]\n\nBe that as it may, it must be stressed that pregnancy is not an \nelement of the crime of rape and is, therefore, totally immaterial to \nthe resolution of this case. Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code \ndefines rape as âhaving carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the \nfollowing circumstances: by using force or intimidation; when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious when the woman is under twelve years of age even though neither of\n the circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall \nbe present.â\n\nIn rape cases, the essential element that the prosecution must prove \nis the absence of the victimâs consent to the sexual congress. The \nPeople must establish that the sexual assault was committed using force or intimidation, or that it was committed against a woman deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious . On the other hand, in statutory rape, all that needs to be proven is that the accused had sexual intercourse with a woman under twelve years of age -- her consent and other circumstances relating to the sexual intercourse being immaterial.\n\nIt bears emphasis that this is a criminal prosecution for rape, \nnot a civil action involving paternity and filiation. That the alleged \nage of the fetus did not coincide with the dates when the victim was \nraped, as appellant insists, is insignificant. Of greater import and \nrelevance is the fact that appellant had carnal knowledge of the victim \non three occasions without her consent. In fact, lack of consent is not \neven an element in Criminal Case No. 40647 because Judilyn was 11 years \nof age only on the date she was assaulted.\n\nThird Issue:\nAlleged Improper Motive\n\nCiting Castillon once more, appellant submits that \nJudilyn âmust have reasoned that it is better to cry ârapeâ and bring \nsuit thereon to salvage her honor in part than to have her reputation \nsullied by being bruited around and stigmatized as a woman with loose \nmorals.â [46]\n\nAppellantâs argument is devoid of merit, for it is utterly \noblivious to the disgrace that is forever etched in the rape victimâs \nbeing. The cultural obstacles that rape victims have to overcome in \ntheir pursuit of justice have long been recognized by the Court, which \nheld that ârape stigmatizes the victim worse than the perpetrator, as \nour culture puts premium into purity and virginity as virtues.â [47] Thus, it further declared that âno young Filipina of decent repute \nwould publicly admit that she was criminally abused unless it is the \ntruth.â [48] Indeed, it is \ncallously insensitive for the appellant to argue that the complainant \nfabricated the charge of rape âto salvage her honor.â\n\nMoreover, it cannot be said that Judilyn had an evil motive in \nimputing the revolting charges to appellant, who conceded this fact in \nhis testimony:\n\nâxxx \n xxx \n xxx\n\nQ Is it not a fact that Judilyn Obera was always in your house and your store, [that] she treats you as a father?\n\nA Yes, I also treat her as my daughter because she is a friend of my daughter.\n\nQ November 28, 1991, April 22, 1991 and February 17, 1992, Judilyn Obera has no grudge against you , is that correct?\n\nA Yes, sir, she has no grudge against me.\n\nQ Nothing at all?\n\nA Nothing at all against me.\n\nxxx xxx xxxâ [49]\n\nIf Judilyn had no grudge against him, why would she concoct such \nrepugnant charges against him? And if, as appellant submits, she only \ncried rape to save her reputation, why would she pinpoint him, whom she \ntreated like a father, as the culprit of not just one count, but three \ncounts of rape? The Court is inclined to believe that, absent any \ncircumstance indicating the contrary, Judilyn brought the charges \nagainst the appellant for one simple reason: She wanted justice.\n\nFourth Issue:\nAlleged Inconsistencies\n\nAppellant likewise claims that Judilynâs testimony shows serious \ninconsistencies, which cast doubt on her credibility as a whole. He \nspecifically points to the fact that, in the latterâs Sinumpaang Salaysay and on direct examination, she did not mention that her mouth was \ncovered by a handkerchief which prevented her from shouting. Only on \ncross-examination did she mention this. [50]\n\nThe argument is not persuasive. Even if there are discrepancies \nin Judilynâs testimony, the same are insignificant. Minor lapses are to \nbe expected when a person is recounting details of a traumatic \nexperience too painful to recall. [51] What is important is that Judilyn was emphatic in describing each rape \nand in identifying the appellant as the one who raped her. Jurisprudence\n holds that âwhen a woman says she has been raped, she says in effect \nall that is necessary to show that the rape has been committed and that \nif her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be \nconvicted on the basis thereof.â [52]\n\nDefense of Alibi Weak\n\nAppellantâs defense of alibi must be rejected. âWhere the accused\n was positively identified by the victim herself who harbored no ill \nmotive against the accused, the defense of alibi must fail.â [53] Alibi is an inherently weak defense. To establish such, the accused \nmust show that he was in some other place for such a period of time, and\n that it was impossible for him to have been at the locus criminis or \nits immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. [54] In this case, appellant, while asserting that he could not have \ncommitted the rape, reveals that the place where he was supposed to be \nat the time the rape was thrice committed was a walking distance of only\n a few minutes from the crime scene. [55] It was therefore not impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed at those particular instances.\n\nDamages\n\nThe Court agrees with the solicitor general that a modification \nof the assailed Decision as regards the civil indemnity is in order. In \nlight of prevailing jurisprudence, [56] appellant should be ordered to pay civil indemnity of P50,000 for each \ncount of rape, and not just a single indemnity for all three cases.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal is hereby DENIED, and the \nquestioned Decision of the trial court, finding Appellant Domingo Sta. \nAna guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of rape and \nsentencing him to three terms of reclusion perpetua, one for each act of\n rape, is hereby AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the indemnity in \nfavor of Complainant Judilyn Obera is INCREASED to one hundred fifty \nthousand pesos (P150,000).
