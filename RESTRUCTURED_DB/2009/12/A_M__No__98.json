LAMORENA\nRTC, Branch 36, Santiago \nCity\n\n\"Judge Efren A. Lamorena, RTC, Branch 36, Santiago City, submitted his \nreasons (pp. 60-61, rollo) for the delay in the resolution of some cases in his \nsala as follows:\n\n\"1. Due to his health problem (a vision impairment) caused by a cataract \ndisease clouding his eyes with intense pain and compromising as it compromised \nhis eyesight thus, preventing him to carry his normal work; (Judge Lamorena \ninformed that as soon as his economic life improves, he will try to submit \nhimself for an eye operation. Just recently he suffered a stroke).\n\n\"2. His health problem is compounded by the hard working condition of his \noffice. It is very small and crowded. All the equipments of the court are \nstocked without any airconditioning unit. (The Team noted that Judge Lamorena \nhas no court and staff room.) He conducts his trials at the corridors and shares \nthe room with the Office of the Clerk of Court.\n\n\"3. His sala was designated to try heinous crimes;\n\n\"4. He likewise revealed that he commutes daily in a public transportation at \na distance of seventy two (72) kilometers one way with a travel time of at least \nfour (4) hours a day.\n\n\"On November 12, 1998 (p. 80, rollo) Judge Lamorena informed that of the \nthirty-one (31) cases mentioned in Item No. 5-a, only six (6) cases remain to be \ndecided or resolved, while seven (7) of the cases listed in Item No. 5-c are \nlikewise being resolved.\n\n\"Judge Lamorena informed that had it not been for the Super Typhoon Iliang \nand later Loleng whose destructive fury devastated the province of Isabela, \nincluding his residence, he would have resolved already all the said cases.\n\n\"He likewise manifested that he is already ready to resume trying cases in \nhis sala.\n\n\"It is should be noted that Judge Lamorena however did not furnish this \nOffice copies of his decisions.\n\n\" JUDGE SERGIO A. PLAN\nMTC, Cauayan, Isabela\n\n\"In his letter dated August 27, 1998 (p. 68, rollo), Judge Plan simply \ninformed the status of the following cases:\n\n\"1. Civil Case No. 1706 - Not submitted for decision because \ndefendants have not been served with summons as they could not be located. Due \nto the inaction of the plaintiff, the case is ordered archived.\n\n\"2. Civil Case Nos. 1894 & 1896 - The Court archived said cases \ndue to the inaction of the plaintiff for unreasonable length of time.\n\n\"3. Civil Case No. 1932 - Not immediately acted upon due to the \nwithdrawal of counsel Atty. Agustin Ladera for the plaintiff and substituted by \nnew counsel Atty. Bernard Olalia who has not filed a formal appearance as \ncounsel for the plaintiff and to have the motion to declare defendants in \ndefault set for hearing with notice to the defendants. Hence, due to the \ninaction of the plaintiff, the Court archived the case.\n\n\"4. Civil Cases Nos. 1946 & 2034 - Not immediately decided due to \nthe failure of the plaintiff to submit the exhibits offered as evidence and as \nthe Court was about to archive the cases, the plaintiff submitted the required \nexhibits and thereupon, the Court rendered its decision dated March 23 and March \n31, 1998, respectively.\" [11]\n\nJudge Wilfredo Ambrosio failed to comply with the directive of the Court. The \nOCA advised the Court that Judge Ambrosio had resigned from the service upon the \nfiling of his certificate of candidacy although his resignation papers, for \npurposes of payment of his benefits, were yet being processed.\n\nWith respect to Judge Fe Albano Madrid, the OCA observed that the delay, for \nonly a number of days, in the resolution of Civil Case No. 0105, was excusable. \nThe slow movement in the other cases was found to be attributable, not to the \nJudge, but mainly to the parties. .\n\nThe OCA noted that Judge Calimag, in not proffering a single explanation, had \ntacitly admitted his failure to resolve the cases assigned to him within the \nreglementary period.\n\nThe OCA said that Judge Plan had given no explanation for his delay in \ndisposing the cases in his sala except to state that it was due to the \nfault of the parties.\n\nThe OCA expressed its sympathy over the plight of Judge Lamorena who suffered \na stroke and eventually died while in service. Judge Wilfredo Tumaliwan was \nforthwith designated as Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 36 vice Judge \nLamorena.\n\nIn his compliance made on 11 May 1999, Judge Plata averred that Criminal \nCases No. 3433, 3434, 2778, 3435, 3071, 2840 and 3570 (instead of 5570), as well \nas Civil Cases No. 320, 327, 399, 322, 328, 325, 330, 326, and 331, were already \ndecided. The Judge, however, failed to submit copies of his orders and decisions \nin the criminal cases. The OCA, in its 28 January 2000 memorandum, observed that \nJudge Plata's orders and decisions were issued only about four (4) months after \nthe judicial audit was conducted. The OCA noted that Civil Cases No. 331, 330, \n322 and 327, while all dated 05 June 1998, were released for mailing only on 07 \nAugust 1998 or almost two (2) months after they were decided.\n\nThe OCA recommended that -\n\n\"1. Judge Fe Albano Madrid, RTC, Branch 21, Santiago City, be REPRIMANDED for the delay in the resolution of Sp. Proc. No. 0105;\n\n\"2. Judge Demetrio Calimag, RTC, Branch 35, Santiago City, be FINED P5,000.00 for his failure to justify the delay in the resolution of the \nfollowing cases:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nCRIMINAL CASES | CIVIL CASES\n | | | \n1. 1898 | 3. 1978 | 1.

No. 97-9-283-RTC (Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in Regional \nTrial Court, Branch 1, Bangued, Abra, 31 May 2000), the Court deemed it \ninappropriate to impose sanction upon Judge Francisco O. Villarta who died \nduring the pendency of the case against him. For like reasons, no administrative \nsanction would here be imposed on Judge Efren A. Lamorena.\n\nIn the resolution of the Court on 20 July 1999, the parties were required to \nmanifest within ten (10) days from notice if they would be willing to submit the \ncase for resolution on the basis of the reports on record. The parties having \nfailed to comply with its directive, the Court resolved to dispense with their \nmanifestation.\n\nThe Court agrees with the OCA that the lapses on the part of the judges can \nbe traced to their failure in the proper observance of the following circulars \nof the Court; to wit:\n\n(1) Administrative Circular No. 1, dated 28 January 1988, which states:\n\n\"1. Effective Docket Control:\n\n1.1 All presiding judges of trial courts must, upon assumption of \noffice, and every semester thereafter on June 30th and December 31st \nof every year conduct a physical inventory of their dockets for the \npurpose of determining the actual number of cases pending in their salas.\n\n1.2 An inventory shall be prepared to indicate the cases pending \ntrial, the cases submitted for decision and the cases that have \nbeen archived . Copy of such inventory shall be submitted to the Supreme \nCourt through the Court Administrator within thirty (30) days from receipt of \nthis Circular and the Inventory Form.\n\n\"1.3 The Presiding Judge and the Clerk of Court shall initial the \nRecords or Rollos of each case to indicate the date of actual inventory. The inventory shall include a list of cases submitted for decision, indicating the title and case number and the date of filing of \nsaid case. An updated inventory is to be submitted to the Supreme Court every \nsix (6) months thereafter as required in Paragraph 1.1. hereof.\" [13]\n\nThe circular has been restated by the Court in Administrative Circular No. \n10-94 of 29 June 1994.\n\n(2) Circular No. 13, dated 01 July 1987, reiterated in Administrative \nCircular No. 3-99, dated 15 January 1999, which mandates:\n\n\"To insure speedy disposition of cases, the following guidelines must be \nfaithfully observed:\n\nI. The session hours of all Regional Trial Courts, Metropolitan Trial Courts, \nMunicipal Trial Courts in Cities, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit \nTrial Courts shall be from 8:30 A.M. to noon and from 2:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M., \nfrom Monday to Friday. The hours in the morning shall be devoted to the conduct \nof trial, while the hours in the afternoon shall be utilized for (1) the conduct \nof pre-trial conferences; (2) writing of decisions, resolutions, or orders; or \n(3) the continuation of trial on the merits, whenever rendered necessary, as may \nbe required by the Rules of Court, statutes, or circulars in specified \ncases.\n\nHowever, in multi-sala courts in places where there are few practicing \nlawyers, the schedule may be modified upon request of the Integrated Bar of the \nPhilippines such that one-half of the branches may hold their trial in the \nmorning and the other half in the afternoon. Except those requiring immediate \naction, all motions should be scheduled for hearing on Friday afternoons, or if \nFriday is a non-working day, in the afternoon of the next business day. The \nunauthorized practice of some judges of entertaining motions or setting them for \nhearing on any other day or time must be immediately stopped.\n\n\"II. Judges must be punctual at all times.\n\n\"III. The Clerk of Court, under the direct supervision of the Judge, must \ncomply with Rule 20 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the calendar \nof cases.\n\n\"IV. There should be strict adherence to the policy on avoiding postponements \nand needless delay.\n\nSections 2, 3 and 4 of Rule 30, 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure on adjournments \nand postponements and on the requisites of a motion to postpone trial for \nabsence of evidence or for illness of a party or counsel should be faithfully \nobserved.\n\nLawyers, as officers of the court, are enjoined to cooperate with judges to \nensure swift disposition of cases.\" [14]\n\nThe Court, here again, must stress that while it is not unaware of the heavy \ncaseload of judges nor is it impervious to the plight of judges, it cannot, \nhowever, take too lightly Rule 3.05, of Canon 3, of the Code of Judicial Conduct \nrequiring the disposition of the court business and of pending cases or \nincidents promptly and seasonably. [15] All that a judge really needs to do, in case of great difficulty, would be to \nrequest for an extension of time over which the Court has, almost invariably, \nbeen sympathetic.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court RESOLVED, conformably with the recommendations of \nthe OCA, that - Judge Fe Albano Madrid, RTC, Branch 21, Santiago City, be REPRIMANDED for the delay in the resolution of Sp. Proc. No. 0105;\nJudge Demetrio D.
