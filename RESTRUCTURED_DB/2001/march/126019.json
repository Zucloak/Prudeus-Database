  "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARIO CALDONA Y LLAMAS, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.: Mario Caldona is a self-confessed womanizer who admits having several wives. His lechery, however, was not merely confined to these women and breaks new ground in terms of the revolting for he satiated his lust and sexual depravity on not only one but three of his daughters. This case is the sordid tale of one of them.For ravishing his daughter Maria Lolita Caldona, accused Mario Caldona y Llamas was charged in Criminal Case No. C-49696 with the crime of Qualified Rape, in an Information[1] which reads:That on or about the 13th day of August 1995 in Kalookan City, MM., Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and taking advantage of his superior strength being her father, by means of force, threats and intimidation employed upon the complainant LOLITA CALDONA Y PONTIVEROS, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with said complainant against her will and without her consent.Contrary to law.Upon arraignment, accused, duly assisted by counsel, refused to enter a plea. The trial court thus entered a plea of not guilty in his behalf.[2] The case thereafter proceeded to trial.After trial, the court a quo rendered judgment finding accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and imposed on him the supreme penalty of death thus:WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered CONVICTING Mario Caldona of the crime of Rape, an offense defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, and the Court sentences MARIO CALDONA to suffer the penalty of DEATH. Ordering Mario Caldona to pay the victim (Ma. Lolita) P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.Mario Caldona shall be committed immediately to the National Bilibid Prisons. The Branch Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to transmit the entire record of this case to the Hon. Clerk of Court, Supreme Court for automatic review of the decision of this Court.SO ORDERED.On automatic review, accused-appellant alleges that -ITHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE AND INCONSISTENT TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.IIGRANTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO ALLEGE IN THE INFORMATION THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE OFFENDED PARTY'S AGE TO BE UNDER EIGHTEEN (18)YEARS.The prosecution's version of the incident is summarized in the People's Brief as follows:On August 13, 1995, private complainant Ma. Lolita Caldona and her sister Ma. Cristina went to 148 B. Serrano Street to ask money from their father, appellant Mario Caldona.[3]Appellant gave private complainant money and asked her to go to 59 B. Serrano Street, Kalookan City.[4] Private complainant proceeded to the said address.[5] After a while, appellant arrived at 59 B. Serrano Street and started undressing private complainant.[6] Thereupon, appellant sexually molested private complainant and inserted his penis into the latter's private parts.[7]After her ravishment, private complainant proceeded to 148 Macabagdal St. where she saw her sisters.[8] Private complainant did not tell anybody about her ordeal in the hands of appellant.[9] She and her sisters went to the Cultural Center of the Philippines.[10]Subsequently, private complainant, together with her sisters and mother went to the house of a certain \"Auntie Thelma.\"[11] They collected their things and went to Payatas, Fairview where they stayed for a week.[12] Thereafter, they transferred to a rented house in Manggahan, Quezon City.[13]Sometime in November 1995, private complainant, accompanied by her aunt, Paz Hontiveros went to Dr. Liza de Guzman of the Mental Hospital for consultation.[14] Private complainant told the doctor about the rape incident.[15] Later on, she was confined at the Mental Hospital for three days because she was hallucinating.[16] She could hear the voice of appellant threatening her and was imagining what the latter was doing to her.[17]On December 14, 1995, private complainant accompanied by her aunt, Paz Hontiveros, proceeded to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to file a complaint against appellant.[18] Private complainant was examined by Dr. Maximo Reyes, NBI.[19] The findings of the examination are as follows: No evident sign of extra-genital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination. Hymen, intact but distensible and its orifice wide (2.5 cms. In diameter) as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized, adult Filipino male organ in full erection without producing any hymenal laceration.[20]Accused-appellant denied the charge[21] and gave a different version of what transpired. He claimed that the filing of the rape case against him was instigated by his brother-in-law and sister-in-law to keep him away from his women and also as a reprisal for his interference in his in-laws' quarrel over family inheritance.[22] More specifically, accused-appellant testified that in the morning of August 13, 1995, at around 7:00 to 7:30 a.m., he was at home in 148 Macabagdal St., Grace Park, Caloocan City with his live-in partner, Honey Bell Meniano, who was then preparing breakfast.[23] He saw his wife, Lolita, the complainant, Ma. Lolita, her siblings Ma. Teresa, Mario, Jr., Ma. Cristina and Mica pass by all dressed up.[24] He called them and asked his wife where they were going.[25] His wife approached and told him that they were going for a walk to the Cultural Center while the children were going swimming.[26] He berated his wife, telling them it was already late in the morning, but still he gave them P100.00 for their taxi fare.[27] The complainant then approached him, kissed him and asked for his permission.[28] He handed the money over and called a cab and after his family left, he went back to eat his breakfast.[29] Thereafter, he proceeded to 59 Macabagdal Street, Grace Park, Caloocan City to see his son Reynold, who was not with the group that went to the Cultural Center. He found the boy sleeping.[30] He woke up Reynold and asked him to send a telegram to his new-found flame, Virgie Labata.[31] Reynold proceeded to the Grand Central Station and sent the telegram.[32]Accused-appellant next proceeded to his electro-mechanical shop at 59 Macabagdal Street to inform his worker Lando Yap, that they would be working overtime that day.[33] There, he found his nephew, Bibeth, who served as his errand boy.[34] He started working upon his arrival at the shop.[35] It was already midnight when accused-appellant learned that his wife and children had not yet returned. Alarmed and fearful that they met an accident, accused-appellant boarded a taxicab and went to the house of his wife's parents at 10th Avenue, but he was told that they were not there. From there, he went to the house of Mary Ann Castro, another of his women, and was likewise told that his family did not go there.[36] He proceeded to the house of his mother to ask for help in the search for his family. He went to the Cultural Center to look for them and reported the matter to the Police Detachment at Luneta, but to no avail.[37] He never saw them again.[38] He only heard from them a month later when he received a letter from complainant telling him not to waste his time and money looking for them anymore because they were already in good hands, and that they wanted to live on their own and to experience life without him.[39]Owing to the gravity of the penalty imposed, the Court must once again defer to the following principles in reviewing rape cases: 1] to accuse a man of rape is easy, but to disprove it is difficult though the accused may be innocent; 2.] considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and 3.] the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.[40] Corollary to these legal yardsticks is the dictum that when a victim of rape says she has been defiled, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her and so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.[41]As in most rape cases, accused-appellant assails the credibility of the victim. However, we have consistently held that the trial court's assessment of the credibility of complainant's testimony is entitled to great weight, absent any showing that some facts were overlooked which, if considered, would affect the outcome of the case.[42]In the case at bar, the testimony of sixteen-year old Ma. Lolita Caldona on how she was raped by her father clearly shows that she was indeed a victim of sexual assault. Thus:ATTY.

QHow did he manifest that you should be there?ABecause one time, when my father came home and tried to have sexual intercourse with my mother but my mother said I should go into our room but my father prevented my mother telling me and said \"pabayaan mo siya.\"[45]Despite persistent efforts by defense counsel to elicit an admission that she had many suitors,[46] that she had four (4) boyfriends,[47] and that she had sex with them,[48] private complainant insisted that she was never touched by anybody except her father, who forced her to have sexual intercourse with him.[49]Accused-appellant merely raised denial as his defense. However, such a defense is unavailing given the facts prevailing herein. The Court has consistently held that denial is an inherently weak defense and, unless supported by clear and convincing evidence, the same can not prevail over the positive declarations of the victim who, in a simple and straightforward manner, convincingly identified the accused-appellant as the defiler of her chastity.In short, the positive assertions of accused-appellant's daughter that he raped her is entitled to greater weight.[50] While denial and alibi are legitimate defenses in rape cases, bare assertions to this effect can not overcome the categorical testimony of the victim.[51] It certainly would take a most senseless kind of depravity for a young daughter to concoct a story which would put her own father to death.[52] Furthermore, no young girl of decent repute would allow the examination of her private parts or subject herself to the shame, embarrassment and humiliation of a public trial, if she has not in fact been raped.[53]A word must, however, be made with regard to the other incidents of rape adverted to by private complainant in the course of her testimony. Each and every charge of rape is a distinct and separate crime so that each charge should be proven beyond reasonable doubt.[54] Thus, for all her testimonial declarations to this effect, her bare statements that she was raped many times by the accused-appellant is clearly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish guilt of the accused-appellant insofar as these other acts of rape are concerned. In People v. Garcia,[55] the Court pointed out that:xxx the indefinite testimonial evidence that complainant was raped every week is decidedly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish the guilt of appellant therefor with the required quantum of evidence. So much of such indefinite imputations of rape, which are uncorroborated by any other evidence, fall within this category.At any rate, the Court finds no reason to reverse the ruling of the trial court insofar as the rape committed on August 13, 1995, as alleged in the Information, is concerned. The act of rape is rendered all the more heinous and reprehensible in this case considering that the victim is merely a fifteen-year old girl whose abuser was her own father.Nevertheless, while the guilt of the accused-appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the imposition of the death penalty against him unwarranted. The circumstances under the amendatory provisions of R.A. No. 7659, Section 11, are in the nature of qualifying circumstances which can not be proved as such unless alleged in the information. Even if such circumstances are proved, the death penalty can not be imposed where the sane were not properly alleged in the Information.[56]In the case at bar, the trial court based the imposition of the death penalty on accused-appellant on Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, which states, in pertinent part:The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances: When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim. x x x.More particularly, the trial court imposed the penalty of death after taking into consideration the age of Ma. Lolita who was then fifteen (15) years and eight (8) months old[57] and the fact that accused-appellant is her father. However, while the qualifying circumstance of relationship has been alleged in the Information, it is devoid of any averment on private complainant's minority. Since one of the twin requirements mentioned, namely, minority, was not alleged in the Information, accused-appellant can neither be convicted for qualified rape nor could the death penalty be meted upon him because to do so would be to deprive him of the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.Viewed vis-Ã -vis the foregoing legal standards, accused-appellant can be convicted of simple rape only, which is punishable with reclusion perpetua. It must be borne in mind that the requirement for complete allegations on the particulars of the indictment is based on the right of the accused to be fully informed of the nature of the charges against him so that he may adequately prepare for his defense pursuant to the due process clause of the Constitution.[58]The penalty prescribed for the offense of simple rape, reclusion perpetua, is an indivisible penalty. Under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, in all cases in which the law prescribes a single indivisible penalty, said penalty shall be applied regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed.[59]Finally, the Court notes that while the trial court awarded moral and exemplary damages, it did not award any civil indemnity which is mandatory upon the finding of rape.[60] Civil indemnity is distinct from and should not be denominated as moral damages which are based on different jural foundations and assessed by the court in the exercise of sound discretion.[61] Current case law fixes indemnity ex delicto at P50,000.00.[62] While the Court agrees that exemplary damages are proper, the amount should be increased to P50,000.00 in order to deter other fathers with perverse tendencies or aberrant sexual behavior like accused-appellant from sexually abusing their daughters.[63]WHEREFORE, the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATIONS that accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and ordered to pay the offended party P50,000.00 as indemnity ex delicto, P50,000.00 as moral damages; and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.SO ORDERED.Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, De Leon, Jr., and Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ., concur.[1] Rollo, p. 3.[2] Record, p. 125.[3] TSN, 15 May 1996, p. 2.[4] Ibid.[5] Id.[6] Id., p. 3.[7] Id.[8] Id., p. 7.[9] Id.[10] Id.[11] Id., p. 21.[12] Id.[13] Id.[14] Id., p. 26.[15] Id.[16] Id.[17] Id.[18] Id., p. 25.[19] Id.[20] Exhibit F.[21] TSN, 31 July 1996, pp. 3, 15, 18.[22] TSN, 31 July 1996, pp. 18-19.[23] Ibid., p. 13[24] Id.[25] Id.[26] Id.[27] Id.[28] Id.[29] Id., pp. 14-15.[30] Id., p. 15.[31] Id.[32] Id.[33] Id., pp. 15-16.[34] Id., p. 16.[35] Id.[36] Id.[37] Id., pp. 16-17.[38] Id., p. 17.[39] Id.[40] People v.

MARIO CALDONA Y LLAMAS, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nMario Caldona is a self-confessed womanizer who admits having several wives. His lechery, however, was not merely confined to these women and breaks new ground in terms of the revolting for he satiated his lust and sexual depravity on not only one but three of his daughters. This case is the sordid tale of one of them.\n\nFor ravishing his daughter Maria Lolita Caldona, accused Mario Caldona y Llamas was charged in Criminal Case No. C-49696 with the crime of Qualified Rape, in an Information [1] which reads:\nThat on or about the 13th day of August 1995 in Kalookan City, MM., Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and taking advantage of his superior strength being her father, by means of force, threats and intimidation employed upon the complainant LOLITA CALDONA Y PONTIVEROS, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with said complainant against her will and without her consent.\n\nContrary to law. Upon arraignment, accused, duly assisted by counsel, refused to enter a plea. The trial court thus entered a plea of not guilty in his behalf. [2] The case thereafter proceeded to trial.\n\nAfter trial, the court a quo rendered judgment finding accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and imposed on him the supreme penalty of death thus:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is rendered CONVICTING Mario Caldona of the crime of Rape, an offense defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, and the Court sentences MARIO CALDONA to suffer the penalty of DEATH. Ordering Mario Caldona to pay the victim (Ma. Lolita) P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nMario Caldona shall be committed immediately to the National Bilibid Prisons. The Branch Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to transmit the entire record of this case to the Hon. Clerk of Court, Supreme Court for automatic review of the decision of this Court.\n\nSO ORDERED. On automatic review, accused-appellant alleges that -\n\nI THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE AND INCONSISTENT TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.\n\nII\nGRANTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO ALLEGE IN THE INFORMATION THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE OFFENDED PARTY'S AGE TO BE UNDER EIGHTEEN (18)YEARS. The prosecution's version of the incident is summarized in the People's Brief as follows:\nOn August 13, 1995, private complainant Ma. Lolita Caldona and her sister Ma. Cristina went to 148 B. Serrano Street to ask money from their father, appellant Mario Caldona. [3]\n\nAppellant gave private complainant money and asked her to go to 59 B. Serrano Street, Kalookan City. [4] Private complainant proceeded to the said address. [5] After a while, appellant arrived at 59 B. Serrano Street and started undressing private complainant. [6] Thereupon, appellant sexually molested private complainant and inserted his penis into the latter's private parts. [7]\n\nAfter her ravishment, private complainant proceeded to 148 Macabagdal St. where she saw her sisters. [8] Private complainant did not tell anybody about her ordeal in the hands of appellant. [9] She and her sisters went to the Cultural Center of the Philippines. [10]\n\nSubsequently, private complainant, together with her sisters and mother went to the house of a certain \"Auntie Thelma.\" [11] They collected their things and went to Payatas, Fairview where they stayed for a week. [12] Thereafter, they transferred to a rented house in Manggahan, Quezon City. [13]\n\nSometime in November 1995, private complainant, accompanied by her aunt, Paz Hontiveros went to Dr. Liza de Guzman of the Mental Hospital for consultation. [14] Private complainant told the doctor about the rape incident. [15] Later on, she was confined at the Mental Hospital for three days because she was hallucinating. [16] She could hear the voice of appellant threatening her and was imagining what the latter was doing to her. [17]\n\nOn December 14, 1995, private complainant accompanied by her aunt, Paz Hontiveros, proceeded to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to file a complaint against appellant. [18] Private complainant was examined by Dr. Maximo Reyes, NBI. [19] The findings of the examination are as follows:\nNo evident sign of extra-genital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination.\n\nHymen, intact but distensible and its orifice wide (2.5 cms. In diameter) as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized, adult Filipino male organ in full erection without producing any hymenal laceration. [20] Accused-appellant denied the charge [21] and gave a different version of what transpired. He claimed that the filing of the rape case against him was instigated by his brother-in-law and sister-in-law to keep him away from his women and also as a reprisal for his interference in his in-laws' quarrel over family inheritance. [22] More specifically, accused-appellant testified that in the morning of August 13, 1995, at around 7:00 to 7:30 a.m., he was at home in 148 Macabagdal St., Grace Park, Caloocan City with his live-in partner, Honey Bell Meniano, who was then preparing breakfast. [23] He saw his wife, Lolita, the complainant, Ma. Lolita, her siblings Ma. Teresa, Mario, Jr., Ma. Cristina and Mica pass by all dressed up. [24] He called them and asked his wife where they were going. [25] His wife approached and told him that they were going for a walk to the Cultural Center while the children were going swimming. [26] He berated his wife, telling them it was already late in the morning, but still he gave them P100.00 for their taxi fare. [27] The complainant then approached him, kissed him and asked for his permission. [28] He handed the money over and called a cab and after his family left, he went back to eat his breakfast. [29] Thereafter, he proceeded to 59 Macabagdal Street, Grace Park, Caloocan City to see his son Reynold, who was not with the group that went to the Cultural Center. He found the boy sleeping. [30] He woke up Reynold and asked him to send a telegram to his new-found flame, Virgie Labata. [31] Reynold proceeded to the Grand Central Station and sent the telegram. [32]\n\nAccused-appellant next proceeded to his electro-mechanical shop at 59 Macabagdal Street to inform his worker Lando Yap, that they would be working overtime that day. [33] There, he found his nephew, Bibeth, who served as his errand boy. [34] He started working upon his arrival at the shop. [35] It was already midnight when accused-appellant learned that his wife and children had not yet returned. Alarmed and fearful that they met an accident, accused-appellant boarded a taxicab and went to the house of his wife's parents at 10th Avenue, but he was told that they were not there. From there, he went to the house of Mary Ann Castro, another of his women, and was likewise told that his family did not go there. [36] He proceeded to the house of his mother to ask for help in the search for his family. He went to the Cultural Center to look for them and reported the matter to the Police Detachment at Luneta, but to no avail. [37] He never saw them again. [38] He only heard from them a month later when he received a letter from complainant telling him not to waste his time and money looking for them anymore because they were already in good hands, and that they wanted to live on their own and to experience life without him. [39]\n\nOwing to the gravity of the penalty imposed, the Court must once again defer to the following principles in reviewing rape cases: 1] to accuse a man of rape is easy, but to disprove it is difficult though the accused may be innocent; 2.] considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and 3.] the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. [40] Corollary to these legal yardsticks is the dictum that when a victim of rape says she has been defiled, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her and so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof. [41]\n\nAs in most rape cases, accused-appellant assails the credibility of the victim. However, we have consistently held that the trial court's assessment of the credibility of complainant's testimony is entitled to great weight, absent any showing that some facts were overlooked which, if considered, would affect the outcome of the case. [42]\n\nIn the case at bar, the testimony of sixteen-year old Ma. Lolita Caldona on how she was raped by her father clearly shows that she was indeed a victim of sexual assault.

A Yes, Your Honor.\n\nQ Was it whose idea (sic) that you must be present during the time they had sexual intercourse?

A Because one time, when my father came home and tried to have sexual intercourse with my mother but my mother said I should go into our room but my father prevented my mother telling me and said \" pabayaan mo siya.\" [45] Despite persistent efforts by defense counsel to elicit an admission that she had many suitors, [46] that she had four (4) boyfriends, [47] and that she had sex with them, [48] private complainant insisted that she was never touched by anybody except her father, who forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. [49]\n\nAccused-appellant merely raised denial as his defense. However, such a defense is unavailing given the facts prevailing herein. The Court has consistently held that denial is an inherently weak defense and, unless supported by clear and convincing evidence, the same can not prevail over the positive declarations of the victim who, in a simple and straightforward manner, convincingly identified the accused-appellant as the defiler of her chastity.\n\nIn short, the positive assertions of accused-appellant's daughter that he raped her is entitled to greater weight. [50] While denial and alibi are legitimate defenses in rape cases, bare assertions to this effect can not overcome the categorical testimony of the victim. [51] It certainly would take a most senseless kind of depravity for a young daughter to concoct a story which would put her own father to death. [52] Furthermore, no young girl of decent repute would allow the examination of her private parts or subject herself to the shame, embarrassment and humiliation of a public trial, if she has not in fact been raped. [53]\n\nA word must, however, be made with regard to the other incidents of rape adverted to by private complainant in the course of her testimony. Each and every charge of rape is a distinct and separate crime so that each charge should be proven beyond reasonable doubt. [54] Thus, for all her testimonial declarations to this effect, her bare statements that she was raped many times by the accused-appellant is clearly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish guilt of the accused-appellant insofar as these other acts of rape are concerned. In People v. Garcia, [55] the Court pointed out that:\n\nxxx the indefinite testimonial evidence that complainant was raped every week is decidedly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish the guilt of appellant therefor with the required quantum of evidence. So much of such indefinite imputations of rape, which are uncorroborated by any other evidence, fall within this category.\n\nAt any rate, the Court finds no reason to reverse the ruling of the trial court insofar as the rape committed on August 13, 1995, as alleged in the Information, is concerned. The act of rape is rendered all the more heinous and reprehensible in this case considering that the victim is merely a fifteen-year old girl whose abuser was her own father.\n\nNevertheless, while the guilt of the accused-appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the imposition of the death penalty against him unwarranted. The circumstances under the amendatory provisions of R.A. No. 7659, Section 11, are in the nature of qualifying circumstances which can not be proved as such unless alleged in the information. Even if such circumstances are proved, the death penalty can not be imposed where the sane were not properly alleged in the Information. [56]\n\nIn the case at bar, the trial court based the imposition of the death penalty on accused-appellant on Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, which states, in pertinent part:\nThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:\nWhen the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim. x x x. More particularly, the trial court imposed the penalty of death after taking into consideration the age of Ma. Lolita who was then fifteen (15) years and eight (8) months old [57] and the fact that accused-appellant is her father. However, while the qualifying circumstance of relationship has been alleged in the Information, it is devoid of any averment on private complainant's minority. Since one of the twin requirements mentioned, namely, minority, was not alleged in the Information, accused-appellant can neither be convicted for qualified rape nor could the death penalty be meted upon him because to do so would be to deprive him of the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.\n\nViewed vis-Ã -vis the foregoing legal standards, accused-appellant can be convicted of simple rape only, which is punishable with reclusion perpetua. It must be borne in mind that the requirement for complete allegations on the particulars of the indictment is based on the right of the accused to be fully informed of the nature of the charges against him so that he may adequately prepare for his defense pursuant to the due process clause of the Constitution. [58]\n\nThe penalty prescribed for the offense of simple rape, reclusion perpetua, is an indivisible penalty. Under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, in all cases in which the law prescribes a single indivisible penalty, said penalty shall be applied regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed. [59]\n\nFinally, the Court notes that while the trial court awarded moral and exemplary damages, it did not award any civil indemnity which is mandatory upon the finding of rape. [60] Civil indemnity is distinct from and should not be denominated as moral damages which are based on different jural foundations and assessed by the court in the exercise of sound discretion. [61] Current case law fixes indemnity ex delicto at P50,000.00. [62] While the Court agrees that exemplary damages are proper, the amount should be increased to P50,000.00 in order to deter other fathers with perverse tendencies or aberrant sexual behavior like accused-appellant from sexually abusing their daughters. [63]\n\nWHEREFORE , the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATIONS that accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and ordered to pay the offended party P50,000 . 00 as indemnity ex delicto , P50,000.00 as moral damages; and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, De Leon, Jr., and Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 3.\n\n[2] Record, p. 125.\n\n[3] TSN, 15 May 1996, p. 2.\n\n[4] Ibid.\n\n[5] Id.\n\n[6] Id., p. 3.\n\n[7] Id.\n\n[8] Id., p. 7.\n\n[9] Id.\n\n[10] Id.\n\n[11] Id., p. 21.\n\n[12] Id.\n\n[13] Id.\n\n[14] Id., p. 26.\n\n[15] Id.\n\n[16] Id.\n\n[17] Id.\n\n[18] Id., p. 25.\n\n[19] Id.\n\n[20] Exhibit F.\n\n[21] TSN, 31 July 1996, pp. 3, 15, 18.\n\n[22] TSN, 31 July 1996, pp. 18-19.\n\n[23] Ibid., p. 13\n\n[24] Id.\n\n[25] Id.\n\n[26] Id.\n\n[27] Id.\n\n[28] Id.\n\n[29] Id., pp. 14-15.\n\n[30] Id., p. 15.\n\n[31] Id.\n\n[32] Id.\n\n[33] Id., pp. 15-16.\n\n[34] Id., p. 16.\n\n[35] Id.\n\n[36] Id.\n\n[37] Id., pp. 16-17.\n\n[38] Id., p. 17.\n\n[39] Id.\n\n[40] People v.
