The three cases were tried jointly and on June 14, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which states:\n\"WHEREFORE, the accused, Roger Austria y Navarro, alias \"Bernie\", is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the three (3) crimes of Murder on two (2) counts, defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code under Criminal Case Nos. L-4168 and L-4189, and, under Criminal Case No. L-4166, of Frustrated Murder, defined and penalized under Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the following penalties:\n\nUnder Criminal Cases Nos. L-4168 and L-4169, imprisonment of double reclusion perpetua; and\n\nUnder Criminal Case No. L-4166, Four (4) Years and Six (6) Months of prision correccional to Sixteen (16) Years and Six (6) Months of prision mayor;\n\nAnd under the said three (3) cases, to indemnify the heirs of Myrna dela Cruz Samson in the amount of P50,000.00, and the heirs of Tyrone Samson in the same amount of P50,000.00, and Mylene Samson in the amount of P40,000.00.\n\nAnd to pay costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\" [4] The prosecutionâs version of the events leading to appellantâs conviction is as follows:\n\nOn September 25, 1989, between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 in the morning, Myrna dela Cruz Samson and six of her seven children namely, victim Mylene, Mary Ann, Melanie, Myra Liza, Teddy and victim Tyrone were fast asleep in their house located at Barangay Domalandan, Lingayen, Pangasinan. Myrna and her sons Tyrone and Teddy, were sleeping in one room while Myrnaâs daughters were sleeping in another bedroom.\n\nAppellant, who was the Samsonsâ next door neighbor, suddenly entered their house, without their knowledge and consent, and proceeded to the room where Myrna and her two sons were sleeping. He stabbed Myrna and Tyrone with a \"balisong\" several times. The victims managed to run away but appellant chased them, continuing with the stabbing until Myrna fell dead by the stairs and Tyrone in front of the altar, in the vacant third bedroom.\n\nWhile the stabbing was going on, Myrnaâs 12-year old daughter Mylene woke up and peeped through an opening of their bedroomâs door which was adjacent to the bedroom of her mother. She saw appellant stabbing her mother first, then her brother Tyrone. When appellant noticed her peeping, he went after her and likewise stabbed her several times inside the room. Thereafter, he left the house through the kitchen door.\n\nGuadalupe dela Cruz, mother of Myrna, was awakened from her sleep by the commotion and moaning in her daughterâs house, which was only about five (5) meters away from her own house. She rushed to the victimsâ house and opened the door. Upon entering the house, she saw her daughter Myrna sprawled dead on the floor. Thereupon, she rushed to the kitchen and saw appellant running away with a \"balisong.\" She looked for her grandson Tyrone and found him also sprawled dead on the floor while her granddaughter Mylene was in a room, already weak because of her stab wounds.\n\nGuadalupe dela Cruz called for the barangay captain, informed him of what transpired and requested him to report the incident to the police of Lingayen, Pangasinan. Mylene was brought to the Pangasinan General Hospital in Dagupan City for treatment of her stab wounds while the bodies of Myrna and her son Tyrone were brought to the Funeraria de Guzman.\n\nDr. Noel Manaois examined Mylene and found two (2) stab wounds, both of which were deep and could have caused her death were it not for the timely medical attention given.\n\nDr. Jose S. Rosario, Municipal Health officer of Lingayen, conducted autopsies on the bodies, prepared the autopsy reports and described the injuries suffered by the victims.\n\nOn his part, appellant denied having killed Myrna Samson and her son Tyrone Samson and denied attempting to kill Mylene Samson. [5] He claimed that he had no prior misunderstanding with Myrna Samson or her husband or her children. [6]\n\nAppellant sought to establish the defense of insanity by presenting Dr. Constantine D. Della, a psychiatrist at Baguio General Hospital, who examined and treated appellant on April 23, 1991 and who issued a \"Psychiatric Evaluation\" dated November 14, 1991 stating that:\n\"In view of the foregoing history, examinations, interviews, and observations, the patient Roger N. Austria is found to be suffering from a long-standing illness classified as Schizophrenic Psychosis, Paranoid type. This is manifested by the patient as follows: (1) deterioration in areas of work, social relations, and personal hygiene; (2) auditory hallucinations; (3) incoherence and irrelevance; (4) talking by himself; (5) delusions of granduer; (6) delusion of persecution; (7) poor impulse control, judgment, and insight; (8) walking aimlessly; (9) failure to sleep well; and (10) violent and destructive behavior.\" [7] The trial court, however, found that appellant was sane when he committed the crimes charged and forthwith convicted him.\n\nBefore us now on appeal, appellant assigns the following errors:\n\"I\n\nTHE COURT A QUO ERRED IN NOT GIVING PROBATIVE WEIGHT TO THE TESTIMONY OF AND PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION BY DR. CONSTANTINE D. DELLA FINDING THE ACCUSED ROGER AUSTRIA TO BE LABORING FROM A LONG-STANDING MENTAL ILLNESS CLASSIFIED AS \"SCHIZOPHRENIC PSYCHOSIS,\" PARANOID TYPE.\n\nII\nTHE COURT A QUO ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF TREACHERY AND ABUSED (SIC) OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH AGAINST THE ACCUSED AND CONSEQUENTLY IN SENTENCING THE ACCUSED OF DOUBLE RECLUSION PERPETUA IN CRIMINAL CASES NOS. L-4168 AND L-4169 AND IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. L-4166 FOR FOUR (4) YEARS AND SIX (6) MONTHS OF PRISION CORRECCIONAL TO SIXTEEN (16) YEARS AND SIX (6) MONTHS OF PRISION MAYOR.\" In amplification of his first assignment of error, appellant contends that he was first admitted to a Mental Hospital in 1972, diagnosed with Schizophrenic Psychosis, Paranoid type and was confined therein for about a month; the second time in 1977 for three weeks, the third time in 1988 for about a month, and the last time on April 8, 1991. [8]\n\nAccordingly, appellant argues, the trial court erred in presuming that he was mentally stable since being released from confinement, as it was only the schizophrenic manifestations that disappeared - not the disease itself.\n\nThe main issue presented before us is whether or not the accused was insane at the time of the commission of the crime, as would exempt him from criminal liability. The answer and resultant decision, therefore, hinges on the meaning of \"insanity.\"\n\nFor a person to be adjudged insane under Art. 12 of the Revised Penal Code, he must be deprived completely of reason or discernment and freedom of the will at the time of committing the crime. [9]\n\nOn various occasions, this court has also declared that \"insanity exists when there is complete deprivation of intelligence in committing the act, that is, the accused is deprived of reason, he acts without the least discernment because there is complete absence of the power to discern, or that there is total deprivation of freedom of the will. Mere abnormality of the mental faculties will not exclude imputability.\" [10]\n\nSection 1039 of the Revised Administrative Code defines insanity as \"a manifestation in language or conduct of disease or defect of the brain, or a more or less permanently diseased or disordered condition of the mentality, functional or organic, and characterized by perversion, inhibition, or disordered function of the sensory or of the intellectual faculties, or by impaired or disordered volition.\"\n\nHowever, there is a vast difference between an insane person and one who has worked himself up into such a frenzy of anger that he fails to use reason or good judgment in what he does. [11]\n\nIn the present case, the accused had been treated before for schizophrenia, paranoid type.\n\nSchizophrenia is defined as a chronic mental disorder characterized by inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and often accompanied by hallucinations and delusions. [12] (underscoring supplied)\n\nA \"Paranoid Type Schizophrenia\" is described as follows:\n\"Frequently the prepsychotic personality of the paranoid schizophrenic is characterized by poor interpersonal rapport. Often he is cold, withdrawn, distrustful, and resentful of other persons. Many are truculent, have a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude, and are argumentative, scornful, sarcastic, defiant, resentful of suggestions or of authority, and given to caustic remarks. Sometimes flippant, facetious responses cover an underlying hostility.\n\nx x x. The patientâs previous negative attitudes become more marked, and misinterpretations are common. Ideas of reference are among the first symptoms. Disorders of association appear. Many patients show an unpleasant emotional aggressiveness. Through displacement, the patient may begin to act out his hostile impulses. His grip on reality begins to loosen. At first his delusions are limited, but later they become numerous and changeable x x x. Delusions of persecution are the most prominent occurrences in paranoid schizophrenia, but expansive and obviously wish-fulfilling ideas and hypochondriacal and depressive delusions are not uncommon. With increasing personality disorganization, delusional beliefs become less logical. Verbal expressions may be inappropriate and neologistic. The patient is subjected to vague magical forces, and his explanations become extremely vague and irrational. Imaginative fantasy may become extreme but take on the value of reality. Repressed aggressive tendencies may be released in a major outburst; some inarticulate paranoids may manifest an unpredictable assaultiveness. Many paranoid schizophrenics are irritable, discontented, resentful, and angrily suspicious and show a surly aversion to being interviewed. Some manifest an unapproachable, aggressively hostile attitude and may live in a bitter aloofness.\" [13] Does schizophrenia therefore fall under the recognized definitions of insanity which would qualify it as an exempting circumstance? It depends.\n\nWe have stated that when insanity of the defendant is alleged as a ground of defense or reason for his exemption from responsibility, the evidence on this point must refer to the time preceding to act under prosecution or at the very moment of its execution. In such case, it is incumbent upon defendantâs counsel to prove that his client was not in his right mind or that he acted under the influence of a sudden attack of insanity or that he was generally regarded as insane when he executed the act attributed to him. [14] In order to ascertain a personâs mental condition at the time of the act, it is permissible to receive evidence of his mental condition during a reasonable period before and after. Direct testimony is not required nor are specific acts of disagreement essential to establish insanity as a defense. A personâs mind can only be plumbed or fathomed by external acts. Thereby his thoughts, motives and emotions may be evaluated to determine whether his external acts conform to those of people of sound mind. To prove insanity, clear and convincing circumstantial evidence would suffice. [15]\n\nUnder present-day American jurisprudence, the states have a variety of rules regarding who hears the burden of proof in insanity defense cases. Many states and the federal government have placed the burden on the defendant to prove legal insanity by a preponderance of evidence. This is now the majority rule. [16]\n\nIn People v. Rafanan, [17] the defense of insanity due to schizophrenia was rejected by the Court as the evidence presented showed that if there was impairment of the mental faculties, such impairment was not so complete as to deprive the accused of intelligence or the consciousness of his acts. Thus, accused Rafanan was charged with rape and the prosecution was able to prove that he was aware of the reprehensible moral quality of the sexual assault. In other words, there was no \"complete loss of intelligence\" that would have entitled the accused to the exempting circumstance of insanity.\n\nLikewise, in the earlier case of People v. Puno, [18] this Court held that the accused Puno was not legally insane when he killed his victim because he was not completely deprived of reason or will. It was the testimony of the three psychiatrists presented by the defense to the effect that Puno acted with discernment that ultimately led to his conviction.\n\nIn the instant case, Dr. Della testified during cross-examination that appellantâs long-standing illness cannot be cured by medication.\n\"PROS. BUGARIN: \"\n\nQ.  With this kind of mental illness, Doctor, your findings would show that with the proper application of medicines, the patient will be cured?\n\nA.  The admission will not provide cure, but only improvement of the patient. It is like a diabetes. The medications will only control the sickness but will not actually eradicate the disease.\" [19] He also testified that when the crimes occurred, appellant was suffering auditory hallucinations and having a relapse. [20]\n\nEvidence of the accusedâs mental and emotional state prior to the commission of the crimes is contained in the Psychiatric Evaluation prepared by Dr. Della:\n\"In September 1989, Roger was behaving unusually again. The auditory hallucinations recurred; this time he was hearing the devil speaking to him, he was unable to sleep well at night and he walked aimlessly. One week later, on September 24, 1989, after having been intoxicated by ten bottles of beer he was suddenly overpowered by the urge to have sexual intercourse with Myrna. In the darkness of the night, he went to Myrnaâs house to find her and her children fast asleep. She (sic) forced her into having sex with him but Myrna vehemently resisted. In that moment of rejection, Roger remembered having been ordered by voices coming from the environment to kill Myrna, he immediately took hold of a knife and stabbed Myrna to death. Myrnaâs two children who witnessed the crime cried frantically. Again, the voices commanded Roger to kill both children. He succeeded in killing one but the other, while sustaining several wounds, survived. In his frenzy, he inadvertently lacerated his right palm. After the attack, he hurried home.\" (Psychiatric Evaluation, Re: Roger N. Austria, p. 3). The Court is convinced that the testimonial and documentary evidence marshalled in this case by acknowledged medical experts have sufficiently established the fact that appellant was legally insane at the time he committed the crimes. His previous confinements, as early as 1972, his erratic behaviour before the assaults and Dr. Dellaâs testimony that he was having a relapse all point to a man deprived of complete freedom of will or a lack of reason and discernment that should thus exempt him from criminal liability. However, he is still civilly liable under Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code which states:\n\"ART. 101. Rules regarding civil liability in certain cases. - The exemption from criminal liability established in subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of Article 12 and in subdivision 4 of Article 11 of this Code does not include exemption from civil liability, which shall be enforced subject to the following rules:\n\nFirst. In cases of subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 of article 12, the civil liability for acts committed by an imbecile or insane person, and by a person under nine years of age, or by one over nine but under fifteen years of age, who has acted without discernment, shall devolve upon those having such person under their legal authority or control, unless it appears that there was no fault or negligence on their part.\n\nShould there be no person having such insane, imbecile or minor under his authority, legal guardianship, or control or if such person be insolvent, said insane, imbecile, or minor shall respond with their own property, excepting property exempt from execution, in accordance with the civil law.\n\nSecond. In case falling with subdivision 4 of article 11, the person for whose benefit the harm has been prevented shall be civilly liable in proportion to the benefit which they may have received.\n\nThe courts shall determine, in their sound discretion, the proportionate amount for which each one shall be liable.\n\nWhen the respective shares cannot be equitably determined, even approximately, or when the liability also attaches to the Government, or to the majority of the inhabitants of the town, and, in all events whenever the damage has been caused with the consent of the authorities or their agents, indemnification shall be made in the manner prescribed by special laws or regulations.\n\nThird. In cases falling within subdivisions 5 and 6 of article 12, the persons using violence or causing the fear shall be primarily liable and secondarily, or, if there be no such persons, those doing the act shall be liable, saving always to the latter that part of their property exempt from execution.\" Thus, following the above provision, the accused must make indemnification to the heirs of his victims, Myrna C. Samson and Tyrone Samson and to the victim who survived, Mylene Samson, in the following amounts:\n1. P50,000.00 to the heirs of Myrna dela Cruz Samson;\n\n2. P50,000.00 to the heirs of Tyrone Samson; and\n\n3. P40,000.00 to Mylene Samson. Finally, since appellant is not criminally responsible, the aggravating circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength are not applicable either. For the above aggravating circumstances to be appreciated, it must be shown that appellant consciously adopted the same as a mode of attack against his victims to insure its commission without risk to himself. [21]\n\nThis is not the case at bar.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court ACQUITS appellant Roger Austria of the crimes of Murder and Frustrated Murder by reason of insanity and he is ordered confined at the National Mental Hospital for treatment until further notice. The Court further orders appellant to indemnify the heirs of Myrna dela Cruz Samson in the amount of P50,000.00, the heirs of Tyrone Samson in the same amount of P50,000.00, and Mylene Samson in the amount of P40,000.00.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nRegalado, (Chairman), Puno, Mendoza, and Torres, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 7.\n\n[2] Rollo, pp. 8-9.\n\n[3] Rollo, pp. 10-11.\n\n[4] Rollo, p. 26.\n\n[5] TSN, January 30, 1992, p. 9.\n\n[6] TSN, p. 23.\n\n[7] Appellantâs Brief, p. 12; Rollo, p. 42.\n\n[8] TSN, April 22, 1992, pp. 11-12.\n\n[9] People v.
