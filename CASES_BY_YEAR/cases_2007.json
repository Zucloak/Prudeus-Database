The Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the 29 December 1998 Decision [4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR 02-00949-95.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe facts, as summarized by the Labor Arbiter and adopted by the NLRC and the Court of Appeals, are as follows:\nOn February 2, 1995, John F. McLeod filed a complaint for retirement benefits, vacation and sick leave benefits, non-payment of unused airline tickets, holiday pay, underpayment of salary and 13th month pay, moral and exemplary damages, attorney\u2019s fees plus interest against Filipinas Synthetic Corporation (Filsyn), Far Eastern Textile Mills, Inc., Sta.

Rosa Textile with Patricio Lim as Chairman and President; that complainant worked for Sta.

Rosa which acquired its assets as per their financial statements (Annexes \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d); that the attendance records of complainant from April 1992 to November 1993 (Annexes \u201c4\u201d and \u201c5\u201d) show that he was either absent or worked at most two hours a day; that Sta. Rosa and Peggy Mills are interposing counterclaims for damages in the total amount of P36,757.00 against complainant; that complainant\u2019s monthly salary at Peggy Mills was P50,495.00 and not P60,000.00; that Peggy Mills, does not have a retirement program; that whatever amount complainant is entitled should be offset with the counterclaims; that complainant worked only for 12 years from 1980 to 1992; that complainant was only hired as a consultant and not an employee by Sta.

Rosa; that he has waived this benefit in his 12 years of work with Peggy Mills; that he is not entitled to 13th month pay as consultant; and that he is not entitled to moral and exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nIn his Reply, complainant alleged that all respondents being one and the same entities are solidarily liable for all salaries and benefits and complainant is entitled to; that all respondents have the same address at 12/F B.A. Lepanto Building, Makati City; that their counsel holds office in the same address; that all respondents have the same offices and key personnel such as Patricio Lim and Eric Hu; that respondents\u2019 Position Paper is verified by Marialen C. Corpuz who knows all the corporate officers of all respondents; that the veil of corporate fiction may be pierced if it is used as a shield to perpetuate fraud and confuse legitimate issues; that complainant never accepted the change in his position from Vice-President and Plant Manger to consultant and it is incumbent upon respondents to prove that he was only a consultant; that the Deed of Dation in Payment with Lease (Annex \u201cC\u201d) proves that Sta. Rosa took over the assets of Peggy Mills as early as June 15, 1992 and not 1995 as alleged by respondents; that complainant never resigned from his job but applied for retirement as per letters (Annexes \u201cE-1\u201d, \u201cE-2\u201d and \u201cF\u201d); that documents \u201cG\u201d, \u201cH\u201d and \u201cI\u201d show that Eric Hu is a top official of Peggy Mills that the closure of Peggy Mills cannot be the fault of complainant; that the strike was staged on the issue of CBA negotiations which is not part of the usual duties and responsibilities as Plant Manager; that complainant is a British national and is prohibited by law in engaging in union activities; that as per Resolution (Annex \u201c3\u201d) of the NLRC in the proper case, complainant testified in favor of management; that the alleged attendance record of complainant was lifted from the logbook of a security agency and is hearsay evidence; that in the other attendance record it shows that complainant was reporting daily and even on Saturdays; that his limited hours was due to the strike and cessation of operations; that as plant manager complainant was on call 24 hours a day; that respondents must pay complainant the unpaid portion of his salaries and his retirement benefits that cash voucher No. 17015 (Annex \u201cK\u201d) shows that complainant drew the monthly salary of P60,000.00 which was reduced to P50,495.00 in August 1990 and therefore without the consent of complainant; that complainant was assured that he will be paid the deduction as soon as the company improved its financial standing but this assurance was never fulfilled; that Patricio Lim promised complainant his retirement pay as per the latter\u2019s letters (Annexes \u201cE-1\u201d, \u201cE-2\u201d and \u201cF\u201d); that the law itself provides for retirement benefits; that Patricio Lim by way of Memorandum (Annex \u201cM\u201d) approved vacation and sick leave benefits of 22 days per year effective 1986; that Peggy Mills required monthly paid employees to sign an acknowledgement that their monthly compensation includes holiday pay; that complainant was not made to sign this undertaking precisely because he is entitled to holiday pay over and above his monthly pay; that the company paid for complainant\u2019s two (2) round trip tickets to London in 1983 and 1986 as reflected in the complainant\u2019s passport (Annex \u201cN\u201d); that respondents claim that complainant is not entitled to 13 th month pay but paid in 1993 and all the past 13 years; that complainant is entitled to moral and exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees; that all doubts must be resolved in favor of complainant; and that complainant reserved the right to file perjury cases against those concerned.\n\nIn their Reply, respondents alleged that except for Peggy Mills, the other respondents are not proper persons in interest due to the lack of employer-employee relationship between them and complainant; that undersigned counsel does not represent Peggy Mills, Inc.\n\nIn a separate Position Paper, respondent Peggy Mills alleged that complainant was hired on February 10, 1991 as per Board Minutes (Annex \u201cA\u201d); that on August 19, 1987, the workers staged an illegal strike causing cessation of operations on July 21, 1992; that respondent filed a Notice of Closure with the DOLE (Annex \u201cB\u201d); that all employees were given separation pay except for complainant whose task was extended to December 31, 1992 to wind up the affairs of the company as per vouchers (Annexes \u201cC\u201d and \u201cC-1\u201d); that respondent offered complainant his retirement benefits under RA 7641 but complainant refused; that the regular salaries of complainant from closure up to December 31, 1992 have offset whatever vacation and sick leaves he accumulated; that his claim for unused plane tickets from 1989 to 1992 has no policy basis, the company\u2019s formula of employees monthly rate x 314 days over 12 months already included holiday pay; that complainant\u2019s unpaid portion of the 13th month pay in 1993 has no basis because he was only an employee up to December 31, 1992; that the 13th month pay was based on his last salary; and that complainant is not entitled to damages. [5] On 3 April 1998, the Labor Arbiter rendered his decision with the following dispositive portion:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, We hold all respondents as jointly and solidarily liable for complainant\u2019s money claims as adjudicated above and computed below as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nRetirement Benefits (one month salary for every year of service)6/80 - 11/30/93 = 14 yearsP60,000 x 14.0 mos. ................... | P 840,000.00\nVacation and Sick Leave (3 yrs.)P2,000.00 x 22 days x 3 yrs. ....... | 132,000.00\nUnderpayment of Salaries (3 yrs.)P60,000 - P50,495 = P9,505P 9,505 x 36.0 mos. .................... | 342,180.00\nHoliday Pay (3 yrs.)P2,000 x 30 days ....................... | 60,000.00\nUnderpayment of 13th month pay (1993)... | 15,816.87\nMoral Damages ..................................... | 3,000,000.00\nExemplary Damages .............................. | 1,000,000.00\n10% Attorney\u2019s Fees ............................. | 138,999.68\nTOTAL | P5,528,996.55\n | \nUnused Airline Tickets (3 yrs.)(To be converted in Peso upon payment)$2,450.00 x 3.0 [yrs.] ................. | $7,350.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nRetirement Benefits (one month salary for every year of service)\n6/80 - 11/30/93 = 14 years\nP60,000 x 14.0 mos. ...................\nP 840,000.00 Vacation and Sick Leave (3 yrs.)\nP2,000.00 x 22 days x 3 yrs. .......\n132,000.00 Underpayment of Salaries (3 yrs.)\nP60,000 - P50,495 = P9,505\nP 9,505 x 36.0 mos. ....................\n342,180.00 Holiday Pay (3 yrs.)\nP2,000 x 30 days .......................\n60,000.00 Underpayment of 13th month pay (1993)... 15,816.87 Moral Damages .....................................\n3,000,000.00 Exemplary Damages ..............................\n1,000,000.00 10% Attorney\u2019s Fees .............................\n138,999.68 TOTAL P5,528,996.55 Unused Airline Tickets (3 yrs.)\n(To be converted in Peso upon payment)\n$2,450.00 x 3.0 [yrs.] .................\n$7,350.00\nSO ORDERED. [6]\n\nFilipinas Synthetic Fiber Corporation (Filsyn), Far Eastern Textile Mills, Inc. (FETMI), Sta. Rosa Textiles, Inc. (SRTI), Patricio L. Lim (Patricio), and Eric Hu appealed to the NLRC. The NLRC rendered its decision on 29 December 1998, thus:\nWHEREFORE, the Decision dated 3 April 1998 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one is entered ORDERING respondent Peggy Mills, Inc. to pay complainant his retirement pay equivalent to 22.5 days for every year of service for his twelve (12) years of service from 1980 to 1992 based on a salary rate of P50,495.00 a month.\n\nAll other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7] John F. McLeod (McLeod) filed a motion for reconsideration which the NLRC denied in its Resolution of 30 June 1999. [8] McLeod thus filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals assailing the decision and resolution of the NLRC. [9]\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nOn 15 June 2000, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment as follows:\nWHEREFORE, the decision dated December 29, 1998 of the NLRC is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that respondent Patricio Lim is jointly and solidarily liable with Peggy Mills, Inc., to pay the following amounts to petitioner John F. McLeod:\nretirement pay equivalent to 22.5 days for every year of service for his twelve (12) years of service from 1980 to 1992 based on a salary rate of P50,495, a month;\n\nmoral damages in the amount of one hundred thousand (P100,000.00) Pesos;\n\nexemplary damages in the amount of fifty thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos; and\n\nattorney\u2019s fees equivalent to 10% of the total award. No costs is awarded.\n\nSO ORDERED. [10] The Court of Appeals rejected McLeod\u2019s theory that all respondent corporations are the same corporate entity which should be held solidarily liable for the payment of his monetary claims.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that the fact that (1) all respondent corporations have the same address; (2) all were represented by the same counsel, Atty. Isidro S. Escano; (3) Atty. Escano holds office at respondent corporations\u2019 address; and (4) all respondent corporations have common officers and key personnel, would not justify the application of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction.\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that there should be clear and convincing evidence that SRTI, FETMI, and Filsyn were being used as alter ego, adjunct or business conduit for the sole benefit of Peggy Mills, Inc. (PMI), otherwise, said corporations should be treated as distinct and separate from each other.\n\nThe Court of Appeals pointed out that the Articles of Incorporation of PMI show that it has six incorporators, namely, Patricio, Jose Yulo, Jr., Carlos Palanca, Jr., Cesar R. Concio, Jr., E. A. Picasso, and Walter Euyang. On the other hand, the Articles of Incorporation of Filsyn show that it has 10 incorporators, namely, Jesus Y. Yujuico, Carlos Palanca, Jr., Patricio, Ang Beng Uh, Ramon A. Yulo, Honorio Poblador, Jr., Cipriano Azada, Manuel Tomacruz, Ismael Maningas, and Benigno Zialcita, Jr.\n\nThe Court of Appeals pointed out that PMI and Filsyn have only two interlocking incorporators and directors, namely, Patricio and Carlos Palanca, Jr.\n\nReiterating the ruling of this Court in Laguio v. NLRC , [11] the Court of Appeals held that mere substantial identity of the incorporators of two corporations does not necessarily imply fraud, nor warrant the piercing of the veil of corporate fiction.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also pointed out that when SRTI and PMI executed the Dation in Payment with Lease, it was clear that SRTI did not assume the liabilities PMI incurred before the execution of the contract.\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that McLeod failed to substantiate his claim that all respondent corporations should be treated as one corporate\n\nentity. The Court of Appeals thus upheld the NLRC\u2019s finding that no employer-employee relationship existed between McLeod and respondent corporations except PMI.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that Eric Hu, as an officer of PMI, should be exonerated from any liability, there being no proof of malice or bad faith on his part. The Court of Appeals, however, ruled that McLeod was entitled to recover from PMI and Patricio, the company\u2019s Chairman and President.\n\nThe Court of Appeals pointed out that Patricio deliberately and maliciously evaded PMI\u2019s financial obligation to McLeod. The Court of Appeals stated that, on several occasions, despite his approval, Patricio refused and ignored to pay McLeod\u2019s retirement benefits. The Court of Appeals stated that the delay lasted for one year prompting McLeod to initiate legal action. The Court of Appeals stated that although PMI offered to pay McLeod his retirement benefits, this offer for P300,000 was still below the \u201cfloor limits\u201d provided by law. The Court of Appeals held that an employee could demand payment of retirement benefits as a matter of right.\n\nThe Court of Appeals stated that considering that PMI was no longer in operation, its \u201cofficer should be held liable for acting on behalf of the corporation.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeals also ruled that since PMI did not have a retirement program providing for retirement benefits of its employees, Article 287 of the Labor Code must be followed. The Court of Appeals thus upheld the NLRC\u2019s finding that McLeod was entitled to retirement pay equivalent to 22.5 days for every year of service from 1980 to 1992 based on a salary rate of P50,495 a month.\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that McLeod was not entitled to payment of vacation, sick leave and holiday pay because as Vice President and Plant Manager, McLeod is a managerial employee who, under Article 82 of the Labor Code, is not entitled to these benefits.\n\nThe Court of Appeals stated that for McLeod to be entitled to payment of service incentive leave and holidays, there must be an agreement to that effect between him and his employer.\n\nMoreover, the Court of Appeals rejected McLeod\u2019s argument that since PMI paid for his two round-trip tickets Manila-London in 1983 and 1986, he was also \u201centitled to unused airline tickets.\u201d The Court of Appeals stated that the fact that PMI granted McLeod \u201cfree transport to and from Manila and London for the year 1983 and 1986 does not ipso facto characterize it as regular that would establish a prevailing company policy.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeals also denied McLeod\u2019s claims for underpayment of salaries and his 13 th month pay for the year 1994. The Court of Appeals upheld the NLRC\u2019s ruling that it could be deduced from McLeod\u2019s own narration of facts that he agreed to the reduction of his compensation from P60,000 to P50,495 in August 1990 to November 1993.\n\nThe Court of Appeals found the award of moral damages for P50,000 in order because of the \u201cstubborn refusal\u201d of PMI and Patricio to respect McLeod\u2019s valid claims.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also ruled that attorney\u2019s fees equivalent to 10% of the total award should be given to McLeod under Article 2208, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. [12]\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nThe Issues\n\nMcLeod submits the following issues for our consideration:\nWhether the challenged Decision and Resolution of the 14th Division of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 15 June 2000 and 27 December 2000, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 55130 are in accord with law and jurisprudence;\n\nWhether an employer-employee relationship exists between the private respondents and the petitioner for purposes of determining employer liability to the petitioner;\n\nWhether the private respondents may avoid their financial obligations to the petitioner by invoking the veil of corporate fiction;\n\nWhether petitioner is entitled to the relief he seeks against the private respondents;\n\nWhether the ruling of [this] Court in Special Police and Watchman Association (PLUM) Federation v. National Labor Relations Commission cited by the Office of the Solicitor General is applicable to the case of petitioner; and\n\nWhether the appeal taken by the private respondents from the Decision of the labor arbiter meets the mandatory requirements recited in the Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended. [13] The Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nThe petition must fail.\n\nMcLeod asserts that the Court of Appeals should not have upheld the NLRC\u2019s findings that he was a managerial employee of PMI from 20 June 1980 to 31 December 1992, and then a consultant of SRTI up to 30 November 1993. McLeod asserts that if only for this \u201cbrazen assumption,\u201d the Court of Appeals should not have sustained the NLRC\u2019s ruling that his cause of action was only against PMI.\n\nThese assertions do not deserve serious consideration.\n\nRecords disclose that McLeod was an employee only of PMI. [14] PMI hired McLeod as its acting Vice President and General Manager on 20 June 1980. [15] PMI confirmed McLeod\u2019s appointment as Vice President/Plant Manager in the Special Meeting of its Board of Directors on 10 February 1981. [16] McLeod himself testified during the hearing before the Labor Arbiter that his \u201cregular employment\u201d was with PMI. [17]\n\nWhen PMI\u2019s rank-and-file employees staged a strike on 19 August 1989 to July 1992, PMI incurred serious business losses. [18] This prompted PMI to stop permanently plant operations and to send a notice of closure to the Department of Labor and Employment on 21 July 1992. [19]\n\nPMI informed its employees, including McLeod, of the closure. [20] PMI paid its employees, including managerial employees, except McLeod, their unpaid wages, sick leave, vacation leave, prorated 13 th month pay, and separation pay. Under the compromise agreement between PMI and its employees, the employer-employee relationship between them ended on 25 November 1992. [21]\n\nRecords also disclose that PMI extended McLeod\u2019s service up to 31 December 1992 \u201cto wind up some affairs\u201d of the company. [22] McLeod testified on cross-examination that he received his last salary from PMI in December 1992. [23]\n\nIt is thus clear that McLeod was a managerial employee of PMI from 20 June 1980 to 31 December 1992.\n\nHowever, McLeod claims that after FETMI purchased PMI in January 1993, he \u201ccontinued to work at the same plant with the same responsibilities\u201d until 30 November 1993. McLeod claims that FETMI merely renamed PMI as SRTI. McLeod asserts that it was for this reason that when he reached the retirement age in 1993, he asked all the respondents for the payment of his benefits. [24]\n\nThese assertions deserve scant consideration.\n\nWhat took place between PMI and SRTI was dation in payment with lease. Pertinent portions of the contract that PMI and SRTI executed on 15 June 1992 read:\nWHEREAS, PMI is indebted to the Development Bank of the Philippines (\u201cDBP\u201d) and as security for such debts (the \u201cObligations\u201d) has mortgaged its real properties covered by TCT Nos. T-38647, T-37136, and T-37135, together with all machineries and improvements found thereat, a complete listing of which is hereto attached as Annex \u201cA\u201d (the \u201cAssets\u201d);\n\nWHEREAS, by virtue of an inter-governmental agency arrangement, DBP transferred the Obligations, including the Assets, to the Asset Privatization Trust (\u201cAPT\u201d) and the latter has received payment for the Obligations from PMI, under APT\u2019s Direct Debt Buy-Out (\u201cDDBO\u201d) program thereby causing APT to completely discharge and cancel the mortgage in the Assets and to release the titles of the Assets back to PMI;\n\nWHEREAS, PMI obtained cash advances from SRTC in the total amount of TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION PESOS (P210,000,000.00) (the \u201cAdvances\u201d) to enable PMI to consummate the DDBO with APT, with SRTC subrogating APT as PMI\u2019s creditor thereby;\n\nWHEREAS, in payment to SRTC for PMI\u2019s liability, PMI has agreed to transfer all its rights, title and interests in the Assets by way of a dation in payment to SRTC, provided that simultaneous with the dation in payment, SRTC shall grant unto PMI the right to lease the Assets under terms and conditions stated hereunder;\n\nx x x x\n\nNOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, and of the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n1. CESSION . In consideration of the amount of TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION PESOS (P210,000,000.00), PMI hereby cedes, conveys and transfers to SRTC all of its rights, title and interest in and to the Assets by way of a dation in payment. [25] (Emphasis supplied) As a rule, a corporation that purchases the assets of another will not be liable for the debts of the selling corporation, provided the former acted in good faith and paid adequate consideration for such assets, except when any of the following circumstances is present: (1) where the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the debts, (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporations, (3) where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation, and (4) where the selling corporation fraudulently enters into the transaction to escape liability for those debts. [26]\n\nNone of the foregoing exceptions is present in this case.\n\nHere, PMI transferred its assets to SRTI to settle its obligation to SRTI in the sum of P210,000,000. We are not convinced that PMI fraudulently transferred these assets to escape its liability for any of its debts. PMI had already paid its employees, except McLeod, their money claims.\n\nThere was also no merger or consolidation of PMI and SRTI.\n\nConsolidation is the union of two or more existing corporations to form a new corporation called the consolidated corporation. It is a combination by agreement between two or more corporations by which their rights, franchises, and property are united and become those of a single, new corporation, composed generally, although not necessarily, of the stockholders of the original corporations.\n\nMerger, on the other hand, is a union whereby one corporation absorbs one or more existing corporations, and the absorbing corporation survives and continues the combined business.\n\nThe parties to a merger or consolidation are called constituent corporations. In consolidation, all the constituents are dissolved and absorbed by the new consolidated enterprise. In merger, all constituents, except the surviving corporation, are dissolved. In both cases, however, there is no liquidation of the assets of the dissolved corporations, and the surviving or consolidated corporation acquires all their properties, rights and franchises and their stockholders usually become its stockholders.\n\nThe surviving or consolidated corporation assumes automatically the liabilities of the dissolved corporations, regardless of whether the creditors have consented or not to such merger or consolidation. [27]\n\nIn the present case, there is no showing that the subject dation in payment involved any corporate merger or consolidation. Neither is there any showing of those indicative factors that SRTI is a mere instrumentality of PMI.\n\nMoreover, SRTI did not expressly or impliedly agree to assume any of PMI\u2019s debts. Pertinent portions of the subject Deed of Dation in Payment with Lease provide, thus:\n2. WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS. PMI hereby warrants and represents the following:\n\nx x x x\n\n(e) PMI shall warrant that it will hold SRTC or its assigns, free and harmless from any liability for claims of PMI\u2019s creditors, laborers, and workers and for physical injury or injury to property arising from PMI\u2019s custody, possession, care, repairs, maintenance, use or operation of the Assets except ordinary wear and tear; [28] (Emphasis supplied) Also, McLeod did not present any evidence to show the alleged renaming of \u201cPeggy Mills, Inc.\u201d to \u201cSta. Rosa Textiles, Inc.\u201d\n\nHence, it is not correct for McLeod to treat PMI and SRTI as the same entity.\n\nRespondent corporations assert that SRTI hired McLeod as consultant after PMI stopped operations. [29] On the other hand, McLeod asserts that he was respondent corporations\u2019 employee from 1980 to 30 November 1993. [30] However, McLeod failed to present any proof of employer-employee relationship between him and Filsyn, SRTI, or FETMI. McLeod testified, thus:\nATTY. ESCANO:\nDo you have any employment contract with Far Eastern Textile?\n\nWITNESS:\nIt is my belief up the present time.\n\nATTY. AVECILLA:\nMay I request that the witness be allowed to go through his Annexes, Your Honor.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nYes, but I want a precise answer to that question. If he has an employment contract with Far Eastern Textile?\n\nWITNESS:\nCan I answer it this way, sir? There is not a valid contract but I was under the impression taking into consideration that the closeness that I had at Far Eastern Textile is enough during that period of time of the development of Peggy Mills to reorganize a staff. I was under the basic impression that they might still retain my status as Vice President and Plant Manager of the company.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nBut the answer is still, there is no employment contract in your possession appointing you in any capacity by Far Eastern?\n\nWITNESS:\nThere was no written contract, sir.\n\nx x x x\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nSo, there is proof that you were in fact really employed by Peggy Mills?\n\nWITNESS:\nYes, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nOf course, my interest now is to whether or not there is a similar document to present that you were employed by the other respondents like Filsyn Corporation?\n\nWITNESS:\nI have no document, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nWhat about Far Eastern Textile Mills?\n\nWITNESS:\nI have no document, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nAnd Sta. Rosa Textile Mills?\n\nWITNESS:\nThere is no document, sir. [31]\n\nx x x x\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes. Let me be more specific, Mr. McLeod. Do you have a contract of employment from Far Eastern Textiles, Inc.?\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about Sta. Rosa Textile Mills, do you have an employment contract from this company?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nx x x x\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And what about respondent Eric Hu. Have you had any contract of employment from Mr. Eric Hu?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not a direct contract but I was taken in and I told to take over this from Mr. Eric Hu. Automatically, it confirms that Mr. Eric Hu, in other words, was under the control of Mr. Patricio Lim at that period of time.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No documents to show, Mr. McLeod?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No. No documents, sir. [32] McLeod could have presented evidence to support his allegation of employer-employee relationship between him and any of Filsyn, SRTI, and FETMI, but he did not. Appointment letters or employment contracts, payrolls, organization charts, SSS registration, personnel list, as well as testimony of co-employees, may serve as evidence of employee status. [33]\n\nIt is a basic rule in evidence that parties must prove their affirmative allegations. While technical rules are not strictly followed in the NLRC, this does not mean that the rules on proving allegations are entirely ignored. Bare allegations are not enough. They must be supported by substantial evidence at the very least. [34]\n\nHowever, McLeod claims that \u201cfor purposes of determining employer liability, all private respondents are one and the same employer\u201d because: (1) they have the same address; (2) they are all engaged in the same business; and (3) they have interlocking directors and officers. [35]\n\nThis assertion is untenable.\n\nA corporation is an artificial being invested by law with a personality separate and distinct from that of its stockholders and from that of other corporations to which it may be connected . [36]\n\nWhile a corporation may exist for any lawful purpose, the law will regard it as an association of persons or, in case of two corporations, merge them into one, when its corporate legal entity is used as a cloak for fraud or illegality. This is the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. The doctrine applies only when such corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime, [37] or when it is made as a shield to confuse the legitimate issues, or where a corporation is the mere alter ego or business conduit of a person, or where the corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of another corporation. [38]\n\nTo disregard the separate juridical personality of a corporation, the wrongdoing must be established clearly and convincingly. It cannot be presumed. [39]\n\nHere, we do not find any of the evils sought to be prevented by the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil.\n\nRespondent corporations may be engaged in the same business as that of PMI, but this fact alone is not enough reason to pierce the veil of corporate fiction. [40]\n\nIn Indophil Textile Mill Workers Union v. Calica , [41] the Court ruled, thus:\nIn the case at bar, petitioner seeks to pierce the veil of corporate entity of Acrylic, alleging that the creation of the corporation is a devise to evade the application of the CBA between petitioner Union and private respondent Company. While we do not discount the possibility of the similarities of the businesses of private respondent and Acrylic, neither are we inclined to apply the doctrine invoked by petitioner in granting the relief sought. The fact that the businesses of private respondent and Acrylic are related, that some of the employees of the private respondent are the same persons manning and providing for auxiliary services to the units of Acrylic, and that the physical plants, offices and facilities are situated in the same compound, it is our considered opinion that these facts are not sufficient to justify the piercing of the corporate veil of Acrylic. [42] (Emphasis supplied) Also, the fact that SRTI and PMI shared the same address, i.e., 11/F BA-Lepanto Bldg., Paseo de Roxas, Makati City, [43] can be explained by the two companies\u2019 stipulation in their Deed of Dation in Payment with Lease that \u201csimultaneous with the dation in payment, SRTC shall grant unto PMI the right to lease the Assets under terms and conditions stated hereunder.\u201d [44]\n\nAs for the addresses of Filsyn and FETMI, Filsyn held office at 12 th Floor, BA-Lepanto Bldg., Paseo de Roxas, Makati City, [45] while FETMI held office at 18F, Tun Nan Commercial Building, 333 Tun Hwa South Road, Sec. 2, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. [46] Hence, they did not have the same address as that of PMI.\n\nThat respondent corporations have interlocking incorporators, directors, and officers is of no moment.\n\nThe only interlocking incorporators of PMI and Filsyn were Patricio and Carlos Palanca, Jr. [47] While Patricio was Director and Board Chairman of Filsyn, SRTI, and PMI, [48] he was never an officer of FETMI.\n\nEric Hu, on the other hand, was Director of Filsyn and SRTI. [49] He was never an officer of PMI.\n\nMarialen C. Corpuz, Filsyn\u2019s Finance Officer, [50] testified on cross-examination that (1) among all of Filsyn\u2019s officers, only she was the one involved in the management of PMI; (2) only she and Patricio were the common officers between Filsyn and PMI; and (3) Filsyn and PMI are \u201ctwo separate companies.\u201d [51]\n\nApolinario L. Posio, PMI\u2019s Chief Accountant, testified that \u201cSRTI is a different corporation from PMI.\u201d [52]\n\nAt any rate, the existence of interlocking incorporators, directors, and officers is not enough justification to pierce the veil of corporate fiction, in the absence of fraud or other public policy considerations. [53]\n\nIn Del Rosario v. NLRC , [54] the Court ruled that substantial identity of the incorporators of corporations does not necessarily imply fraud.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, and there being no proof of employer-employee relationship between McLeod and respondent corporations and Eric Hu, McLeod\u2019s cause of action is only against his former employer, PMI.\n\nOn Patricio\u2019s personal liability, it is settled that in the absence of malice, bad faith, or specific provision of law, a stockholder or an officer of a corporation cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities. [55]\n\nTo reiterate, a corporation is a juridical entity with legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it. The rule is that obligations incurred by the corporation, acting through its directors, officers, and employees, are its sole liabilities. [56]\n\nPersonal liability of corporate directors, trustees or officers attaches only when (1) they assent to a patently unlawful act of the corporation, or when they are guilty of bad faith or gross negligence in directing its affairs, or when there is a conflict of interest resulting in damages to the corporation, its stockholders or other persons; (2) they consent to the issuance of watered down stocks or when, having knowledge of such issuance, do not forthwith file with the corporate secretary their written objection; (3) they agree to hold themselves personally and solidarily liable with the corporation; or (4) they are made by specific provision of law personally answerable for their corporate action . [57]\n\nConsidering that McLeod failed to prove any of the foregoing exceptions in the present case, McLeod cannot hold Patricio solidarily liable with PMI.\n\nThe records are bereft of any evidence that Patricio acted with malice or bad faith. Bad faith is a question of fact and is evidentiary. Bad faith does not connote bad judgment or negligence. It imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious wrongdoing. It means breach of a known duty through some ill motive or interest. It partakes of the nature of fraud. [58]\n\nIn the present case, there is nothing substantial on record to show that Patricio acted in bad faith in terminating McLeod\u2019s services to warrant Patricio\u2019s personal liability. PMI had no other choice but to stop plant operations. The work stoppage therefore was by necessity. The company could no longer continue with its plant operations because of the serious business losses that it had suffered. The mere fact that Patricio was president and director of PMI is not a ground to conclude that he should be held solidarily liable with PMI for McLeod\u2019s money claims.\n\nThe ruling in A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU v. NLRC , [59] which the Court of Appeals cited, does not apply to this case. We quote pertinent portions of the ruling, thus:\n(a) Article 265 of the Labor Code, in part, expressly provides:\n\n\u201cAny worker whose employment has been terminated as a consequence of an unlawful lockout shall be entitled to reinstatement with full backwages.\u201d\n\nArticle 273 of the Code provides that:\n\n\u201cAny person violating any of the provisions of Article 265 of this Code shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding five hundred pesos and/or imprisonment for not less than one (1) day nor more than six (6) months.\u201d\n\n(b) How can the foregoing provisions be implemented when the employer is a corporation? The answer is found in Article 212 (c) of the Labor Code which provides:\n\u201c(c) \u2018Employer\u2019 includes any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly. The term shall not include any labor organization or any of its officers or agents except when acting as employer.\u201dThe foregoing was culled from Section 2 of RA 602, the Minimum Wage Law. Since RANSOM is an artificial person, it must have an officer who can be presumed to be the employer, being the \u201cperson acting in the interest of (the) employer\u201d RANSOM. The corporation, only in the technical sense, is the employer. The responsible officer of an employer corporation can be held personally, not to say even criminally, liable for non-payment of back wages. That is the policy of the law.\n\nx x x x\n\n(c) If the policy of the law were otherwise, the corporation employer can have devious ways for evading payment of back wages. In the instant case, it would appear that RANSOM, in 1969, foreseeing the possibility or probability of payment of back wages to the 22 strikers, organized ROSARIO to replace RANSOM, with the latter to be eventually phased out if the 22 strikers win their case. RANSOM actually ceased operations on May 1, 1973, after the December 19, 1972 Decision of the Court of Industrial Relations was promulgated against RANSOM. [60] (Emphasis supplied) Clearly, in A.C. Ransom , RANSOM, through its President, organized ROSARIO to evade payment of backwages to the 22 strikers. This situation, or anything similar showing malice or bad faith on the part of Patricio, does not obtain in the present case. In Santos v. NLRC , [61] the Court held, thus:\nIt is true, there were various cases when corporate officers were themselves held by the Court to be personally accountable for the payment of wages and money claims to its employees. In A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU vs. NLRC , for instance, the Court ruled that under the Minimum Wage Law, the responsible officer of an employer corporation could be held personally liable for nonpayment of backwages for \u201c(i)f the policy of the law were otherwise, the corporation employer (would) have devious ways for evading payment of backwages.\u201d In the absence of a clear identification of the officer directly responsible for failure to pay the backwages, the Court considered the President of the corporation as such officer. The case was cited in Chua vs. NLRC in holding personally liable the vice-president of the company, being the highest and most ranking official of the corporation next to the President who was dismissed for the latter\u2019s claim for unpaid wages.\n\nA review of the above exceptional cases would readily disclose the attendance of facts and circumstances that could rightly sanction personal liability on the part of the company officer. In A.C. Ransom , the corporate entity was a family corporation and execution against it could not be implemented because of the disposition posthaste of its leviable assets evidently in order to evade its just and due obligations. The doctrine of \u201cpiercing the veil of corporate fiction\u201d was thus clearly appropriate. Chua likewise involved another family corporation, and this time the conflict was between two brothers occupying the highest ranking positions in the company. There were incontrovertible facts which pointed to extreme personal animosity that resulted, evidently in bad faith, in the easing out from the company of one of the brothers by the other.\n\nThe basic rule is still that which can be deduced from the Court\u2019s pronouncement in Sunio vs. National Labor Relations Commission ; thus:\nWe come now to the personal liability of petitioner, Sunio, who was made jointly and severally responsible with petitioner company and CIPI for the payment of the backwages of private respondents. This is reversible error. The Assistant Regional Director\u2019s Decision failed to disclose the reason why he was made personally liable. Respondents, however, alleged as grounds thereof, his being the owner of one-half (\u00bd) interest of said corporation, and his alleged arbitrary dismissal of private respondents.\n\nPetitioner Sunio was impleaded in the Complaint in his capacity as General Manager of petitioner corporation. There appears to be no evidence on record that he acted maliciously or in bad faith in terminating the services of private respondents. His act, therefore, was within the scope of his authority and was a corporate act.\n\nIt is basic that a corporation is invested by law with a personality separate and distinct from those of the persons composing it as well as from that of any other legal entity to which it may be related. Mere ownership by a single stockholder or by another corporation of all or nearly all of the capital stock of a corporation is not of itself sufficient ground for disregarding the separate corporate personality. Petitioner Sunio, therefore, should not have been made personally answerable for the payment of private respondents\u2019 back salaries. [62] (Emphasis supplied) Thus, the rule is still that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil applies only when the corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime. In the absence of malice, bad faith, or a specific provision of law making a corporate officer liable, such corporate officer cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities. Neither Article 212(c) nor Article 273 (now 272) of the Labor Code expressly makes any corporate officer personally liable for the debts of the corporation. As this Court ruled in H.L. Carlos Construction, Inc. v. Marina Properties Corporation : [63]\nWe concur with the CA that these two respondents are not liable. Section 31 of the Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68) provides:\n\u201cSection 31. Liability of directors, trustees or officers . - Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith ... shall be liable jointly and severally for all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its stockholders and other persons.\u201d The personal liability of corporate officers validly attaches only when (a) they assent to a patently unlawful act of the corporation; or (b) they are guilty of bad faith or gross negligence in directing its affairs; or (c) they incur conflict of interest, resulting in damages to the corporation, its stockholders or other persons.\n\nThe records are bereft of any evidence that Typoco acted in bad faith with gross or inexcusable negligence, or that he acted outside the scope of his authority as company president. The unilateral termination of the Contract during the existence of the TRO was indeed contemptible \u2013 for which MPC should have merely been cited for contempt of court at the most \u2013 and a preliminary injunction would have then stopped work by the second contractor. Besides, there is no showing that the unilateral termination of the Contract was null and void. [64] McLeod is not entitled to payment of vacation leave and sick leave as well as to holiday pay. Article 82, Title I, Book Three of the Labor Code, on Working Conditions and Rest Periods, provides:\nCoverage. ? The provisions of this title shall apply to employees in all establishments and undertakings whether for profit or not, but not to government employees, managerial employees , field personnel, members of the family of the employer who are dependent on him for support, domestic helpers, persons in the personal service of another, and workers who are paid by results as determined by the Secretary of Labor in appropriate regulations.\n\nAs used herein, \u201cmanagerial employees\u201d refer to those whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff. (Emphasis supplied) As Vice President/Plant Manager, McLeod is a managerial employee who is excluded from the coverage of Title I, Book Three of the Labor Code. McLeod is entitled to payment of vacation leave and sick leave only if he and PMI had agreed on it. The payment of vacation leave and sick leave depends on the policy of the employer or the agreement between the employer and employee. [65] In the present case, there is no showing that McLeod and PMI had an agreement concerning payment of these benefits.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s assertion of underpayment of his 13 th month pay in December 1993 is unavailing. [66] As already stated, PMI stopped plant operations in 1992. McLeod himself testified that he received his last salary from PMI in December 1992. After the termination of the employer-employee relationship between McLeod and PMI, SRTI hired McLeod as consultant and not as employee. Since McLeod was no longer an employee, he was not entitled to the 13 th month pay. [67] Besides, there is no evidence on record that McLeod indeed received his alleged \u201creduced 13 th month pay of P44,183.63\u201d in December 1993. [68]\n\nAlso unavailing is McLeod\u2019s claim that he was entitled to the \u201cunpaid monetary equivalent of unused plane tickets for the period covering 1989 to 1992 in the amount of P279,300.00.\u201d [69] PMI has no company policy granting its officers and employees expenses for trips abroad. [70] That at one time PMI reimbursed McLeod for his and his wife\u2019s plane tickets in a vacation to London [71] could not be deemed as an established practice considering that it happened only once. To be considered a \u201cregular practice,\u201d the giving of the benefits should have been done over a long period, and must be shown to have been consistent and deliberate. [72]\n\nIn American Wire and Cable Daily Rated Employees Union v. American Wire and Cable Co., Inc. , [73] the Court held that for a bonus to be enforceable, the employer must have promised it, and the parties must have expressly agreed upon it, or it must have had a fixed amount and had been a long and regular practice on the part of the employer.\n\nIn the present case, there is no showing that PMI ever promised McLeod that it would continue to grant him the benefit in question. Neither is there any proof that PMI and McLeod had expressly agreed upon the giving of that benefit.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s reliance on Annex M [74] can hardly carry the day for him. Annex M, which is McLeod\u2019s letter addressed to \u201cPhilip Lim, VP Administration,\u201d merely contains McLeod\u2019s proposals for the grant of some benefits to supervisory and confidential employees. Contrary to McLeod\u2019s allegation, Patricio did not sign the letter. Hence, the letter does not embody any agreement between McLeod and the management that would entitle McLeod to his money claims.\n\nNeither can McLeod\u2019s assertions find support in Annex U. [75] Annex U is the Agreement which McLeod and Universal Textile Mills, Inc. executed in 1959. The Agreement merely contains the renewal of the service agreement which the parties signed in 1956.\n\nMcLeod cannot successfully pretend that his monthly salary of P60,000 was reduced without his consent.\n\nMcLeod testified that in 1990, Philip Lim explained to him why his salary would have to be reduced. McLeod said that Philip told him that \u201cthey were short in finances; that it would be repaid.\u201d [76] Were McLeod not amenable to that reduction in salary, he could have immediately resigned from his work in PMI.\n\nMcLeod knew that PMI was then suffering from serious business losses. In fact, McLeod testified that PMI was not able to operate from August 1989 to 1992 because of the strike. Even before 1989, as Vice President of PMI, McLeod was aware that the company had incurred \u201chuge loans from DBP.\u201d [77] As it happened, McLeod continued to work with PMI. We find it pertinent to quote some portions of Apolinario Posio\u2019s testimony, to wit:\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You also stated that before the period of the strike as shown by annex \u201cK\u201d of the reply filed by the complainant which was I think a voucher, the salary of Mr. McLeod was roughly P60,000.00 a month?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And as shown by their annex \u201cL\u201d to their reply, that this was reduced to roughly P50,000.00 a month?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You stated that this was indeed upon the instruction by the Vice-President of Peggy Mills at that time and that was Mr. Philip Lim, would you not?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of your own personal knowledge, can you say if this was, in fact, by agreement between Mr. Philip Lim or any other officers of Peggy Mills and Mr. McLeod?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I recall it correctly, I assume it was an agreement, verbal agreement with, between Mr. Philip Lim and Mr. McLeod, because the voucher that we prepared was actually acknowledged by Mr. McLeod, the reduced amount was acknowledged by Mr. McLeod thru the voucher that we prepared.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, Mr. Witness, you mean to tell us that Mr. McLeod continuously received the reduced amount of P50,000.00 by signing the voucher and receiving the amount in question?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as you remember, Mr. Posio, was there any complaint by Mr. McLeod because of this reduced amount of his salary at that time?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t have any personal knowledge of any complaint, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At least, that is in so far as you were concerned, he said nothing when he signed the voucher in question?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, you also stated that the reason for what appears to be an agreement between Peggy Mills and Mr. McLeod in so far as the reduction of his salary from P60,000.00 to P50,000.00 a month was because he would have a reduced number of working days in view of the strike at Peggy Mills, is that right?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And that this was so because on account of the strike, there was no work to be done in the company?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir. [78]\n\nx x x x\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, you also stated if you remember during the first time that you testified that in the beginning, the monthly salary of the complainant was P60,000.00, is that correct?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And because of the long period of the strike, when there was no work to be done, by agreement with the complainant, his monthly salary was adjusted to only P50,495 because he would not have to report for work on Saturday. Do you remember having made that explanation?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You also stated that the complainant continuously received his monthly salary in the adjusted amount of P50,495.00 monthly signing the necessary vouchers or pay slips for that without complaining, is that not right, Mr. Posio?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir. [79] Since the last salary that McLeod received from PMI was P50,495, that amount should be the basis in computing his retirement benefits. McLeod must be credited only with his service to PMI as it had a juridical personality separate and distinct from that of the other respondent corporations.\n\nSince PMI has no retirement plan, [80] we apply Section 5, Rule II of the Rules Implementing the New Retirement Law which provides:\n5.1 In the absence of an applicable agreement or retirement plan, an employee who retires pursuant to the Act shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.\n\n5.2 Components of One-half (1/2) Month Salary. ? For the purpose of determining the minimum retirement pay due an employee under this Rule, the term \u201cone-half month salary\u201d shall include all of the following:\n(a) Fifteen (15) days salary of the employee based on his latest salary rate . x x x With McLeod having worked with PMI for 12 years, from 1980 to 1992, he is entitled to a retirement pay equivalent to \u00bd month salary for every year of service based on his latest salary rate of P50,495 a month.\n\nThere is no basis for the award of moral damages.\n\nMoral damages are recoverable only if the defendant has acted fraudulently or in bad faith, or is guilty of gross negligence amounting to bad faith, or in wanton disregard of his contractual obligations. The breach must be wanton, reckless, malicious, or in bad faith, oppressive or abusive. [81] From the records of the case, the Court finds no ultimate facts to support a conclusion of bad faith on the part of PMI.\n\nRecords disclose that PMI had long offered to pay McLeod his money claims. In their Comment, respondents assert that they offered to pay McLeod the sum of P840,000, as \u201cseparation benefits, and not P300,000, if only to buy peace and to forestall any complaint\u201d that McLeod may initiate before the NLRC. McLeod admitted at the hearing before the Labor Arbiter that PMI has made this offer ?\nATTY. ESCANO:\nx x x According to your own statement in your Position Paper and I am referring to page 8, your unpaid retirement benefit for fourteen (14) years of service at P60,000.00 per year is P840,000.00, is that correct?\n\nWITNESS:\nThat is correct, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nAnd this amount is correct P840,000.00, according to your Position Paper?\n\nWITNESS:\nThat is correct, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nThe question I want to ask is, are you aware that this amount was offered to you sometime last year through your own lawyer, my good friend, Atty. Avecilla, who is right here with us?\n\nWITNESS:\nI was aware, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nSo this was offered to you, is that correct?\n\nWITNESS:\nI was told that a fixed sum of P840,000.00 was offered.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nAnd , of course, the reason, if I may assume, that you declined this offer was that, according to you, there are other claims which you would like to raise against the Respondents which, by your impression, they were not willing to pay in addition to this particular amount?\n\nWITNESS:\nYes, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nThe question now is, if the same amount is offered to you by way of retirement which is exactly what you stated in your own Position Paper, would you accept it or not?\n\nWITNESS:\nNot on the concept without all the basic benefits due me, I will refuse. [82]\n\nx x x x\n\nATTY. ROXAS:\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You mentioned in the cross-examination of Atty. Escano that you were offered the separation pay in 1994, is that correct, Mr. Witness?\n\nWITNESS:\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was offered a settlement of P300,000.00 for complete settlement and that was I think in January or February 1994, sir.\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nNo. What was mentioned was the amount of P840,000.00.\n\nWITNESS:\nWhat did you say, Atty. Escano?\n\nATTY. ESCANO:\nThe amount that I mentioned was P840,000.00 corresponding to the . . . . . . .\n\nWITNESS:\nMay I ask that the question be clarified, your Honor?\n\nATTY. ROXAS:\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You mentioned that you were offered for the settlement of your claims in 1994 for P840,000.00, is that right, Mr. Witness?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During that period in time, while the petition in this case was ongoing, we already filed a case at that period of time, sir. There was a discussion. To the best of my knowledge, they are willing to settle for P840,000.00 and based on what the Attorney told me, I refused to accept because I believe that my position was not in anyway due to a compromise situation to the benefits I am entitled to. [83] Hence, the awards for exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees are not proper in the present case. [84]\n\nThat respondent corporations, in their appeal to the NLRC, did not serve a copy of their memorandum of appeal upon PMI is of no moment. Section 3(a), Rule VI of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure provides:\nRequisites for Perfection of Appeal. ? (a) The appeal shall be filed within the reglementary period as provided in Section 1 of this Rule; shall be under oath with proof of payment of the required appeal fee and the posting of a cash or surety bond as provided in Section 5 of this Rule; shall be accompanied by a memorandum of appeal x x x and proof of service on the other party of such appeal. (Emphasis supplied) The \u201cother party\u201d mentioned in the Rule obviously refers to the adverse party, in this case, McLeod. Besides, Section 3, Rule VI of the Rules which requires, among others, proof of service of the memorandum of appeal on the other party, is merely a rundown of the contents of the required memorandum of appeal to be submitted by the appellant. These are not jurisdictional requirements. [85]\n\nWHEREFORE, we DENY the petition and AFFIRM the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 55130, with the following MODIFICATIONS : (a) the retirement pay of John F. McLeod should be computed at \u00bd month salary for every year of service for 12 years based on his salary rate of P50,495 a month; (b) Patricio L. Lim is absolved from personal liability; and (c) the awards for moral and exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees are deleted.

NO. 154739, January 23, 2007 ]\n\nROGELIO (ROGER) PANOTES (THRU ARACELI BUMATAY, AS SUCCESSOR-IN-INTEREST), PETITIONER, VS. CITY TOWNHOUSE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nROGELIO (ROGER) PANOTES (THRU ARACELI BUMATAY, AS SUCCESSOR-IN-INTEREST), PETITIONER, VS. CITY TOWNHOUSE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nSANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:\n\nFor our resolution is the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated January 29, 2002 in CA-G.R. SP No. 52621 and its Resolution [2] dated August 5, 2002 denying the motion for reconsideration.\n\nThis case stemmed from a complaint filed with the National Housing Authority (NHA) in April 1979 by Rogelio (Roger) Panotes, petitioner, then president of the Provident Village Homeowners Association, Inc., against Provident Securities Corporation (PROSECOR), owner-developer of the Provident Village in Marikina City. The complaint, docketed as NHA Case No. 4175, alleges that PROSECOR violated Sections 19, 20, 21, 38, and 39 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957. [3] One of the violations complained of was its failure to provide an open space in the said subdivision.\n\nDuring the proceedings before the NHA, an ocular inspection showed that the subdivision has no open space. The NHA found, however, that Block 40, with an area of 22,916 square meters, could be utilized as open space. Thus, in its Resolution dated August 14, 1980, the NHA directed PROSECOR to provide the Provident Village an open space which is Block 40.\n\nIn a letter of the same date, then NHA Acting General Manager Antonio A. Fernando ordered PROSECOR to \u201cprovide Block 40 of the subdivision as open space.\u201d\n\nPROSECOR was served copies of the NHA Resolution and the letter on August 22, 1980.\n\nConsidering that PROSECOR did not appeal from the NHA Resolution, it became final and executory.\n\nWhen Panotes filed a motion for execution of the NHA Resolution, it was found that the records of the case were \u201cmysteriously missing.\u201d Hence, his motion \u201cwas provisionally dismissed\u201d without prejudice.\n\nMeanwhile, PROSECOR sold to City Townhouse Development Corporation (CTDC), respondent, several lots in the subdivision. Among the lots sold were those comprising Block 40. CTDC was unaware of the NHA Resolution ordering PROSECOR to have Block 40 utilized as open space of Provident Village.\n\nEventually, Panotes was succeeded by Araceli Bumatay as president of the Provident Village Homeowners Association, Inc. On July 17, 1990, she filed with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) a complaint for revival of the NHA Resolution dated August 14, 1980. Impleaded therein as defendant was CTDC, whom she alleged as successor-in-interest of PROSECOR.\n\nIn its answer, CTDC averred, among others, that (1) Araceli Bumatay has no legal personality to file the action for revival of judgment; (2) there is a pending litigation between CTDC and PROSECOR involving Block 40; and (3) other entities like the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas and Provident Savings Bank have existing liens over Block 40.\n\nOn October 15, 1991, the HLURB, through Housing and Land Use Arbiter Charito M. Bunagan, rendered its Decision in favor of Bumatay, reviving the NHA Resolution and declaring Block 40 of the Provident Village as \u201copen space\u201d for the said subdivision, thus:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Block 40 (with an area of 22,916 square meters) of the Subdivision Plan Pcs-5683 of the Provident Villages located at Marikina, Metro Manila as the legally mandated \u201copen space\u201d for said subdivision project; and the Register of Deeds for Marikina is hereby directed to cause the annotation of this fact on the corresponding Torrens Title which describes and covers said open space; said area to be reserved and utilized exclusively in the manner and for the purposes provided for under P.D. N0. 957 and P.D. No. 1216. [4]\n\nFurthermore, let a Cease and Desist Order be, as it is hereby, issued against respondent Provident Securities Corp. and City Townhouse Development Corporation, restraining said respondents, and all persons, agents, or other associations or corporate entities acting on their behalf, from asserting or perpetrating any or further acts of dominion or claim over said Block 40, Pcs-5683, the open space allocated and reserved for the Provident Villages in Marikina, Metro Manila.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. On appeal to the HLURB Board of Commissioners, Arbiter Bunagan\u2019s Decision was affirmed with modification in the sense that CTDC has the right to recover from PROSECOR \u201cwhat it has lost.\u201d\n\nAfter its motion for reconsideration was denied, CTDC then interposed an appeal to the Office of the President (OP). On February 10, 1999, the OP rendered its Decision affirming in toto the judgment of the HLURB Board of Commissioners. CTDC filed a motion for reconsideration, but it was denied in a Resolution dated April 14, 1999.\n\nCTDC then filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Procedure, as amended, docketed therein as CA-G.R. SP No. 52621.\n\nIn a Resolution [5] dated May 10, 1999, the Court of Appeals dismissed CTDC\u2019s petition for its failure to attach thereto a certification against forum shopping. The Court of Appeals also found that the petition was not supported by certified true copies of such material portions of the records and other pertinent papers referred to in the petition.\n\nCTDC filed a motion for reconsideration which was opposed by Bumatay.\n\nOn June 10, 1999, CTDC submitted to the Court of Appeals a certification of non-forum shopping as well as the pleadings mentioned in its Resolution.\n\nOn July 27, 1999, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution granting CTDC\u2019s motion for reconsideration and reinstated its petition.\n\nOn January 29, 2002, the appellate court rendered its Decision reversing the Decision of the OP and dismissing the complaint for revival of judgment, thus:\nIN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, finding merit in this petition for review, the assailed Decision of the Office of the President dated February 10, 1999, together with its Resolution dated February 14, 1999 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one entered dismissing HLRB Case No. REM-071790-4052 (NHA Case No. 4175; HLRB Case No. REM-A-1089). Costs against the respondent.\n\nSO ORDERED. The basic issue for our resolution is whether the NHA Resolution dated August 14, 1980 may be enforced against CTDC.\n\nAn action for revival of judgment is no more than a procedural means of securing the execution of a previous judgment which has become dormant after the passage of five years without it being executed upon motion of the prevailing party. It is not intended to re-open any issue affecting the merits of the judgment debtor\u2019s case nor the propriety or correctness of the first judgment. [6]\n\nHere, the original judgment or the NHA Resolution sought to be revived was between Rogelio Panotes and PROSECOR, not between petitioner Araceli Bumatay and respondent CTDC.\n\nIn maintaining that CTDC is bound by the NHA Resolution, petitioner claims that CTDC is the successor-in-interest of PROSECOR and, therefore, assumed the obligations of the latter to provide an open space for Provident Village.\n\nCTDC purchased from PROSECOR Block 40 in the said village, not as an owner-developer like PROSECOR, but as an ordinary buyer of lots. Even after the sale, CTDC did not become an owner-developer. The Deed of Sale executed by CTDC, as buyer, and PROSECOR, as seller, shows that the subject matter of the sale is the unsold lots comprising Block 40 within the subdivision to CTDC. The contract does not include the transfer of rights of PROSECOR as owner-developer of the said subdivision. Clearly, there is no basis to conclude that CTDC is the successor-in-interest of PROSECOR.\n\nIt bears stressing that when CTDC bought Block 40, there was no annotation on PROSECOR\u2019s title showing that the property is encumbered. In fact, the NHA Resolution was not annotated thereon. CTDC is thus a buyer in good faith and for value, and as such, may not be deprived of the ownership of Block 40. Verily, the NHA Resolution may not be enforced against CTDC.\n\nSection 2 of P.D. No. 1216 provides:\nSection 2 . Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 957 is hereby amended to read as follows:\nSection 31. Roads, Alleys, Sidewalks and Open Spaces. \u2013 The owner or developer of a subdivision shall provide adequate roads, alleys and sidewalks. For subdivision projects of one (1) hectare or more, the owner shall reserve thirty percent (30%) of the gross area for open space.\nxxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx. Clearly, providing an open space within the subdivision remains to be the obligation of PROSECOR, the owner-developer and the real party-in-interest in the case for revival of judgment. As aptly held by the Court of Appeals:\n\nQuintessentially, the real party-in-interest in the revival of NHA Case No. 4175 is PROSECOR and not CTDC. PROSECOR was the lone defendant or respondent in that case against whom judgment was rendered. To insist that CTDC is a successor-in-interest of PROSECOR may have some truth if we are talking about the ownership of the lots sold by PROSECOR in favor of CTDC as a result of a civil action between the two. But then, to hold CTDC as the successor-in-interest of PROSECOR as the developer of the subdivision, is far from realty. CTDC is simply on the same footing as any lot buyer-member of PVHIA. x x x.\n\nFurthermore, strangers to a case, like CTDC, are not bound by the judgment rendered by a court. It will not divest the rights of a party who has not and never been a party to a litigation. Execution of a judgment can be issued only against a party to the action and not against one who did not have his day in court. [7]\n\nWHEREFORE, we DENY the petition and AFFIRM the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 52621.

NO. 166645, January 23, 2007 ]\n[ G.R. NO. 166645, January 23, 2007 ]\n\nVICENTE D. HERCE, JR., PETITIONER, VS. MUNICIPALITY OF CABUYAO, LAGUNA AND JOSE B. CARPENA, RESPONDENTS. \nRESOLUTION\nVICENTE D. HERCE, JR., PETITIONER, VS. MUNICIPALITY OF CABUYAO, LAGUNA AND JOSE B. CARPENA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nFor resolution is the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioner Vicente D. Herce, Jr. of the Decision dated November 11, 2005, the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The validity of Decree No. 4244 issued on March 3, 1991 in favor of respondent Municipality of Cabuy[a]o, Laguna is AFFIRMED, whereas Decree No. N-216115 and Original Certificate of Title No. 0-2099, issued in the name of petitioner Herce, are declared NULL and VOID.\n\nSO ORDERED. In denying the petition, we held that:\n\n[I]t is clear that Decree No. 4244 issued in favor of the respondent municipality in 1911 has become indefeasible; as such, petitioner is now barred from claiming the subject land. Although the municipality\u2019s claim of ownership is based on the entry in the Ordinary Decree Book, LRC (CLR) Rec. No. 6763, showing that Decree No. 4244 was issued on March 3, 1911 and that Lot I Plan II-2719 was one of the six parcels of land previously applied for registration by the Municipality of Cabuyao in LRC (GLRO) Record No. 6763, being a public document, the Ordinary Decree Book is prima facie proof of the entries appearing therein. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Ordinary Decree Book, LRC (CLR) Rec. No. 6763, showing that Decree No. 4244 was issued on March 3, 1911, is presumed to have been regularly issued by the accountable public officers who enjoy the legal presumption of regularity in the performance of their functions. Thus, the proceedings that led to the issuance of Decree No. 4244 in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao cannot be overturned without any countervailing proof to the contrary. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nAccordingly, the decree of registration issued by the LRA on January 28, 1997 in favor of petitioner, followed by the issuance of OCT No. O-2099, pertaining to the same parcel of land covered by Decree No. 4244, has no legal basis and should be nullified.\nIn his Motion for Reconsideration , petitioner principally claimed that the entries in the Ordinary Decree Book of the Land Registration Authority (LRA) did not categorically state that the property covered by Decree No. N-216115 and OCT No. O-2099 was included in Decree No. 4244. As such, the title issued in his favor could not be declared void, because it had not been shown by competent proof that the lot covered thereby was included in Decree No. 4244.\n\nPetitioner thus prayed that: (a) The parcel of land identified as Lot Plan II-2719-A and Cadastral Lot No. 3484 be declared as not included in Decree No. 4244 issued in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao; (b) The Municipality of Cabuyao be declared as having been barred by laches from recovering the title and ownership over the subject property; (c) Jose B. Carpena should be declared as having been barred by laches from asserting ownership over the subject property; and (d) Decree No. N-216115 and OCT No. 0-2099 issued in favor of petitioner should be declared as valid. In the alternative, petitioner prayed that the assailed Decision be partially reconsidered by remanding the case to the trial court for the determination of whether the property subject of litigation was included in Decree No. 4244 issued in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao. If found to be included, then OCT No. 0-2099 and Decree No. N-216115 issued in favor of petitioner should be declared as void.\n\nIn its Opposition/Comment to petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration , respondents maintained that Lot 1, Plan II-2719-A, the property subject of litigation, was included in Decree No. 4244 issued in the name of the Municipality of Cabuyao, as shown by the following pieces of evidence, to wit:\n(a) Survey Plan conducted by the Bureau of Lands with notation at the bottom portion indicating that Decree No. 4244 was issued in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao on March 3, 1911 over the Lot 1, Plan II-2719-A;\n\n(b) Certification issued by Mr. Teodoro Bonifacio, then Administrator of the Land Registration Authority, stating that Plan SWO-25706 (II-2719-A) was presented as evidence in the \u201cCarpena case;\u201d\n\n(c) Entries in the Ordinary Decree Book of the LRA;\n\n(d) LRA Report dated December 2, 1980 narrating the history of the subject property; and\n\n(e) Survey Plan over Lot 3484.\nThe motion is partially granted.\n\nThe inherent power of a court to amend and control its processes and orders includes the right to reverse itself if only to make its findings and conclusions conformable to law and justice. Every court has the power and the corresponding duty to review, amend or reverse its findings and conclusions whenever its attention is seasonably called to any error or defect that it may have committed.\n\nWe have given the assailed Decision as well as the parties\u2019 respective evidence and arguments a hard second look. It appearing that we have overlooked certain crucial points and arguments and calling to mind the Court\u2019s duty to rectify its mistakes when warranted by the facts and the law at hand, we are constrained to partially grant petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\nAfter a careful and more circumspect re-evaluation of the evidence before us, we are convinced that the case should be remanded to the trial court. It must be recalled that on August 21, 1998, the trial court issued an Order, the dispositive portion of which states:\nIn view of the foregoing rule, and considering the Report dated December 2, 1980, of the Acting Commissioner of Land Registration x x x that Decree No. 4244 was issued on x x x March 3, 1911 in LRC (GLRO), Record No. 6763, in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao for apparently the same parcel of land applied for herein, this Court resolves to open the decree of registration issued herein. The Decision of this Court dated May 29, 1957, in Land Registration Case No. N-438, LRC Record No. 10514, insofar as Lot 1, Plan II-2719 only is concerned, and the Order of this Court dated May 3, 1996 are both set aside.\n\nSet this case for presentation of evidence for claimant Vicente Herce, Jr. on September 28, 1998 at 8:30 a.m.\n\nSO ORDERED. [1]\nFrom the foregoing Order, it is clear that petitioner must still present evidence to prove his claim over the subject property. Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the Order was denied; hence, he filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals where the sole issue for resolution was whether the trial court gravely abused its discretion in granting respondent municipality\u2019s motion to reopen the decree of registration. Finding that the latter met all the requirements to reopen the decree of registration, the Court of Appeals denied the petition. At the same time, it ruled that:\nIt should be recalled that the basis of the issuance of the Decree in favor of the petitioner in the case at bar is the May 30, 1980 Decision of Branch I of the Court of First Instance of Laguna in Cad. Case No. N-B-1-LRC Cad No. N-651 instituted by the Republic of the Philippines denying the latter\u2019s petition for registration which is in turn based on the opposition filed by the petitioner alleging therein that he is the rightful owner of the property having acquired the same from Jose Carpena.\n\nNoticeable from the said May 30, 1980 decision however is that the existence of Decree No. 4244 issued on March 3, 1911 was never mentioned. Neither was it mentioned in the petitioner\u2019s motion to modify decision dated June 26, 1995. In fact, when asked to comment on the petitioner\u2019s motion to modify decision, the LRA interposed no objection thereto, but with the caveat that \u201cxxx provided it will not adversely affect the government as well as third parties.\u201d\n\nOf course, the controversy could have easily ended at this point had LRA exercised prudence in checking its records and would have found out the existence of Decree No. 4244 in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao. As it were, however, the motion to modify decision was granted, notwithstanding the fact that the 1957 decision of the trial court directing the issuance of the corresponding decrees over the 44 parcels of land applied for by the group of Juanita Carpena had already attained finality, that decrees over the 42 of these parcels have already been issued, and that the property subject of the present case was not issued a decree in view precisely of the existence of Decree 4244.\n\nClearly, the decree was issued upon the petitioner\u2019s manifestation before the trial court that it was the rightful owner of the property subject of the controversy and that as transferee and therefore the successor-in-interest of the original applicant Juanita Carpena, he was entitled to the issuance of a decree of registration as decreed in the 1957 Decision of the CFI of Laguna.\n\nx x x x\n\nIn the case at bar, the respondent municipality in its petition/motion to reopen/review decree alleged that as early as March 3, 1911, it has been issued Decree No. 4244 over Lot I Plan II 2719-A (now Lot 3484, Cabuyao Cadastral 455-1). In 1975, petitioner entered his opposition to the case claiming to be the possessor of the said parcel. While the court ruled in favor of the petitioner in the said case and ordered a decree of registration in his favor, it was subsequently found out in a report dated December 2, 1980 that the decree ordered by the court could not be issued as it appears in the Ordinary Decree Book of the LRC Record 6763, a previous decree (Decree 4244) dated March 3, 1911 was already issued in favor of the Municipality which is the same parcel of land sought to be registered by the oppositor in his name.\n\nSpecifically, the ground relied upon by the municipality in seeking the reopening of the decree of registration is the Report dated December 2, 1980 of the Land Registration Authority in Cadastral Case No. N-B-1, LRC Cadastral No. N-651 that after plotting the technical descriptions of Lot 3484, in the Municipal Index Map, it was found that said lot is more or less identical to the parcel of land described in Plan II-2719-A for which no final decree of registration has as yet been issued.\n\nTo hold otherwise would result in a situation wherein the LRA would be compelled to issue a decree of registration over a piece of land which has already been decreed and titled in the name of another, if it were found out that indeed, the property has already been earlier titled in the name of the municipality.\n\nConsidering the existence of two conflicting titles \u2013 one in favor of petitioner, and the other in the name of the Municipality of Cabuyao, the court properly granted the reopening of the decree of title in order to finally settle the issue of ownership over the property subject of the instant controversy and to end this litigation which has dragged on for decades. [2]\nThe foregoing pronouncements of the Court of Appeals do not expressly state that the property covered by OCT No. 0-2099 and Decree No. N-216115 issued in favor of petitioner is included and within the scope of Decree No. 4244 earlier issued in 1911 in favor of respondent municipality.\n\nAs we have ruled in the assailed Decision, there is no doubt that Decree No. 4244 issued in favor of the municipality has become indefeasible. However, based on the records before us, there is insufficient information to conclude that Decree No. 4244 includes the property covered by OCT No. 0-2099 and Decree No. N-216115. As such, there is a need to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings. As correctly noted by the Court of Appeals:\nConsidering the existence of two conflicting titles \u2013 one in favor of petitioner, and the other in the name of the Municipality of Cabuyao, the court properly granted the reopening of the decree of title in order to finally settle the issue of ownership over the property subject of the instant controversy and to end this litigation which has dragged on for decades. [3]\nIt is elementary that a court must render judgment confirming the title of the applicant only if it finds that the latter has sufficient title proper for registration. An application for land registration may include two or more parcels of land, but the court may at any time order an application to be amended by striking out one or more of the parcels or order a severance of the application.\n\nWHEREFORE, the assailed Decision is PARTIALLY RECONSIDERED . The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Laguna, Branch 24 for the determination of whether the subject property is included in Decree No. 4244 issued in favor of the Municipality of Cabuyao.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] See CA Decision, pp. 3-4; rollo , pp. 47-48.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 55-58.\n\n[3] Id. at 58.\n\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

REYES, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, CJ.:\n\nUnder the present provisions of the Tax Code and pursuant to elementary due process, taxpayers must be informed in writing of the law and the facts upon which a tax assessment is based; otherwise, the assessment is void. Being invalid, the assessment cannot in turn be used as a basis for the perfection of a tax compromise.\n\nThe Case\n\nBefore us are two consolidated [1] Petitions for Review [2] filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the August 8, 2003 Decision [3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 71392. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads as follows:\n\"WHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . The assailed decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE without prejudice to the action of the National Evaluation Board on the proposed compromise settlement of the Maria C. Tancinco estate's tax liability.\" [4]\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe CA narrated the facts as follows:\n\n\"On July 8, 1993, Maria C. Tancinco (or \"decedent\") died, leaving a 1,292 square-meter residential lot and an old house thereon (or \"subject property\") located at 4931 Pasay Road, Dasmari\u00f1as Village, Makati City.\n\n\"On the basis of a sworn information-for-reward filed on February 17, 1997 by a certain Raymond Abad (or \"Abad\"), Revenue District Office No. 50 (South Makati) conducted an investigation on the decedent's estate (or \"estate\"). Subsequently, it issued a Return Verification Order. But without the required preliminary findings being submitted, it issued Letter of Authority No. 132963 for the regular investigation of the estate tax case. Azucena T. Reyes (or \"[Reyes]\"), one of the decedent's heirs, received the Letter of Authority on March 14, 1997.\n\n\"On February 12, 1998, the Chief, Assessment Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue (or \"BIR\"), issued a preliminary assessment notice against the estate in the amount of P14,580,618.67. On May 10, 1998, the heirs of the decedent (or \"heirs\") received a final estate tax assessment notice and a demand letter, both dated April 22, 1998, for the amount of P14,912,205.47, inclusive of surcharge and interest.\n\n\"On June 1, 1998, a certain Felix M. Sumbillo (or \"Sumbillo\") protested the assessment [o]n behalf of the heirs on the ground that the subject property had already been sold by the decedent sometime in 1990.\n\n\"On November 12, 1998, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (or \"[CIR]\") issued a preliminary collection letter to [Reyes], followed by a Final Notice Before Seizure dated December 4, 1998.\n\n\"On January 5, 1999, a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was served upon the estate, followed on February 11, 1999 by Notices of Levy on Real Property and Tax Lien against it.\n\n\"On March 2, 1999, [Reyes] protested the notice of levy. However, on March 11, 1999, the heirs proposed a compromise settlement of P1,000,000.00.\n\n\"In a letter to [the CIR] dated January 27, 2000, [Reyes] proposed to pay 50% of the basic tax due, citing the heirs' inability to pay the tax assessment. On March 20, 2000, [the CIR] rejected [Reyes's] offer, pointing out that since the estate tax is a charge on the estate and not on the heirs, the latter's financial incapacity is immaterial as, in fact, the gross value of the estate amounting to P32,420,360.00 is more than sufficient to settle the tax liability. Thus, [the CIR] demanded payment of the amount of P18,034,382.13 on or before April 15, 2000[;] otherwise, the notice of sale of the subject property would be published.\n\n\"On April 11, 2000, [Reyes] again wrote to [the CIR], this time proposing to pay 100% of the basic tax due in the amount of P5,313,891.00. She reiterated the proposal in a letter dated May 18, 2000.\n\n\"As the estate failed to pay its tax liability within the April 15, 2000 deadline, the Chief, Collection Enforcement Division, BIR, notified [Reyes] on June 6, 2000 that the subject property would be sold at public auction on August 8, 2000.\n\n\"On June 13, 2000, [Reyes] filed a protest with the BIR Appellate Division. Assailing the scheduled auction sale, she asserted that x x x the assessment, letter of demand[,] and the whole tax proceedings against the estate are void ab initio. She offered to file the corresponding estate tax return and pay the correct amount of tax without surcharge [or] interest.\n\n\"Without acting on [Reyes's] protest and offer, [the CIR] instructed the Collection Enforcement Division to proceed with the August 8, 2000 auction sale. Consequently, on June 28, 2000, [Reyes] filed a [P]etition for [R]eview with the Court of Tax Appeals (or \"CTA\"), docketed as CTA Case No. 6124.\n\n\"On July 17, 2000, [Reyes] filed a Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction or Status Quo Order, which was granted by the CTA on July 26, 2000. Upon [Reyes's] filing of a surety bond in the amount of P27,000,000.00, the CTA issued a [R]esolution dated August 16, 2000 ordering [the CIR] to desist and refrain from proceeding with the auction sale of the subject property or from issuing a [W]arrant of [D]istraint or [G]arnishment of [B]ank [A]ccount[,] pending determination of the case and/or unless a contrary order is issued.\n\n\"[The CIR] filed a [M]otion to [D]ismiss the petition on the grounds (i) that the CTA no longer has jurisdiction over the case[,] because the assessment against the estate is already final and executory; and (ii) that the petition was filed out of time. In a [R]esolution dated November 23, 2000, the CTA denied [the CIR's] motion.\n\n\"During the pendency of the [P]etition for [R]eview with the CTA, however, the BIR issued Revenue Regulation (or \"RR\") No. 6-2000 and Revenue Memorandum Order (or \"RMO\") No. 42-2000 offering certain taxpayers with delinquent accounts and disputed assessments an opportunity to compromise their tax liability.\n\n\"On November 25, 2000, [Reyes] filed an application with the BIR for the compromise settlement (or \"compromise\") of the assessment against the estate pursuant to Sec. 204(A) of the Tax Code, as implemented by RR No. 6-2000 and RMO No. 42-2000.\n\n\"On December 26, 2000, [Reyes] filed an Ex-Parte Motion for Postponement of the hearing before the CTA scheduled on January 9, 2001, citing her pending application for compromise with the BIR. The motion was granted and the hearing was reset to February 6, 2001.\n\n\"On January 29, 2001, [Reyes] moved for postponement of the hearing set on February 6, 2001, this time on the ground that she had already paid the compromise amount of P1,062,778.20 but was still awaiting approval of the National Evaluation Board (or \"NEB\"). The CTA granted the motion and reset the hearing to February 27, 2001.\n\n\"On February 19, 2001, [Reyes] filed a Motion to Declare Application for the Settlement of Disputed Assessment as a Perfected Compromise. In said motion, she alleged that [the CIR] had not yet signed the compromise[,] because of procedural red tape requiring the initials of four Deputy Commissioners on relevant documents before the compromise is signed by the [CIR]. [Reyes] posited that the absence of the requisite initials and signature[s] on said documents does not vitiate the perfected compromise.\n\n\"Commenting on the motion, [the CIR] countered that[,] without the approval of the NEB, [Reyes's] application for compromise with the BIR cannot be considered a perfected or consummated compromise.\n\n\"On March 9, 2001, the CTA denied [Reyes's] motion, prompting her to file a Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam . In a [R]esolution dated April 10, 2001, the CTA denied the [M]otion for [R]econsideration with the suggestion that[,] for an orderly presentation of her case and to prevent piecemeal resolutions of different issues, [Reyes] should file a [S]upplemental [P]etition for [R]eview[,] setting forth the new issue of whether there was already a perfected compromise.\n\n\"On May 2, 2001, [Reyes] filed a Supplemental Petition for Review with the CTA, followed on June 4, 2001 by its Amplificatory Arguments (for the Supplemental Petition for Review), raising the following issues:\n\"1. Whether or not an offer to compromise by the [CIR], with the acquiescence by the Secretary of Finance, of a tax liability pending in court, that was accepted and paid by the taxpayer, is a perfected and consummated compromise.\n\n\"2. Whether this compromise is covered by the provisions of Section 204 of the Tax Code (CTRP) that requires approval by the BIR [NEB].\" \"Answering the Supplemental Petition, [the CIR] averred that an application for compromise of a tax liability under RR No. 6-2000 and RMO No. 42-2000 requires the evaluation and approval of either the NEB or the Regional Evaluation Board (or \"REB\"), as the case may be.\n\n\"On June 14, 2001, [Reyes] filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings; the motion was granted on July 11, 2001. After submission of memoranda, the case was submitted for [D]ecision.\n\n\"On June 19, 2002, the CTA rendered a [D]ecision, the decretal portion of which pertinently reads:\n\"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the instant [P]etition for [R]eview is hereby DENIED. Accordingly, [Reyes] is hereby ORDERED to PAY deficiency estate tax in the amount of Nineteen Million Five Hundred Twenty Four Thousand Nine Hundred Nine and 78/100 (P19,524,909.78), computed as follows:\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\n\"[Reyes] is likewise ORDERED to PAY 20% delinquency interest on deficiency estate tax due of P17,934,382.13 from January 11, 2001 until full payment thereof pursuant to Section 249(c) of the Tax Code, as amended.\"\n\"In arriving at its decision, the CTA ratiocinated that there can only be a perfected and consummated compromise of the estate's tax liability[,] if the NEB has approved [Reyes's] application for compromise in accordance with RR No. 6-2000, as implemented by RMO No. 42-2000.\n\n\"Anent the validity of the assessment notice and letter of demand against the estate, the CTA stated that \"at the time the questioned assessment notice and letter of demand were issued, the heirs knew very well the law and the facts on which the same were based.\" It also observed that the petition was not filed within the 30-day reglementary period provided under Sec. 11 of Rep. Act No. 1125 and Sec. 228 of the Tax Code.\" [5] Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nIn partly granting the Petition, the CA said that Section 228 of the Tax Code and RR 12-99 were mandatory and unequivocal in their requirement. The assessment notice and the demand letter should have stated the facts and the law on which they were based; otherwise, they were deemed void. [6] The appellate court held that while administrative agencies, like the BIR, were not bound by procedural requirements, they were still required by law and equity to observe substantive due process. The reason behind this requirement, said the CA, was to ensure that taxpayers would be duly apprised of -- and could effectively protest -- the basis of tax assessments against them. [7] Since the assessment and the demand were void, the proceedings emanating from them were likewise void, and any order emanating from them could never attain finality.\n\nThe appellate court added, however, that it was premature to declare as perfected and consummated the compromise of the estate's tax liability. It explained that, where the basic tax assessed exceeded P1 million, or where the settlement offer was less than the prescribed minimum rates, the National Evaluation Board's (NEB) prior evaluation and approval were the conditio sine qua non to the perfection and consummation of any compromise. [8] Besides, the CA pointed out, Section 204(A) of the Tax Code applied to all compromises, whether government-initiated or not. [9] Where the law did not distinguish, courts too should not distinguish.\n\nHence, this Petition. [10]\n\nThe Issues\n\nIn GR No. 159694, petitioner raises the following issues for the Court's consideration:\n\n\"I.\nWhether petitioner's assessment against the estate is valid.\n\n\"II.\nWhether respondent can validly argue that she, as well as the other heirs, was not aware of the facts and the law on which the assessment in question is based, after she had opted to propose several compromises on the estate tax due, and even prematurely acting on such proposal by paying 20% of the basic estate tax due.\" [11] The foregoing issues can be simplified as follows: first, whether the assessment against the estate is valid; and, second , whether the compromise entered into is also valid.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Petition is unmeritorious.\n\nFirst Issue:\nValidity of the Assessment Against the Estate\n\nThe second paragraph of Section 228 of the Tax Code [12] is clear and mandatory. It provides as follows:\n\"Sec. 228. Protesting of Assessment. --\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\n\"The taxpayers shall be informed in writing of the law and the facts on which the assessment is made: otherwise, the assessment shall be void.\" In the present case, Reyes was not informed in writing of the law and the facts on which the assessment of estate taxes had been made. She was merely notified of the findings by the CIR, who had simply relied upon the provisions of former Section 229 [13] prior to its amendment by Republic Act (RA) No. 8424, otherwise known as the Tax Reform Act of 1997.\n\nFirst, RA 8424 has already amended the provision of Section 229 on protesting an assessment. The old requirement of merely notifying the taxpayer of the CIR's findings was changed in 1998 to informing the taxpayer of not only the law, but also of the facts on which an assessment would be made; otherwise, the assessment itself would be invalid.\n\nIt was on February 12, 1998, that a preliminary assessment notice was issued against the estate. On April 22, 1998, the final estate tax assessment notice, as well as demand letter, was also issued. During those dates, RA 8424 was already in effect. The notice required under the old law was no longer sufficient under the new law.\n\nTo be simply informed in writing of the investigation being conducted and of the recommendation for the assessment of the estate taxes due is nothing but a perfunctory discharge of the tax function of correctly assessing a taxpayer. The act cannot be taken to mean that Reyes already knew the law and the facts on which the assessment was based. It does not at all conform to the compulsory requirement under Section 228. Moreover, the Letter of Authority received by respondent on March 14, 1997 was for the sheer purpose of investigation and was not even the requisite notice under the law.\n\nThe procedure for protesting an assessment under the Tax Code is found in Chapter III of Title VIII, which deals with remedies. Being procedural in nature, can its provision then be applied retroactively? The answer is yes.\n\nThe general rule is that statutes are prospective. However, statutes that are remedial, or that do not create new or take away vested rights, do not fall under the general rule against the retroactive operation of statutes. [14] Clearly, Section 228 provides for the procedure in case an assessment is protested. The provision does not create new or take away vested rights. In both instances, it can surely be applied retroactively. Moreover, RA 8424 does not state, either expressly or by necessary implication, that pending actions are excepted from the operation of Section 228, or that applying it to pending proceedings would impair vested rights.\n\nSecond , the non-retroactive application of Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 12-99 is of no moment, considering that it merely implements the law.\n\nA tax regulation is promulgated by the finance secretary to implement the provisions of the Tax Code. [15] While it is desirable for the government authority or administrative agency to have one immediately issued after a law is passed, the absence of the regulation does not automatically mean that the law itself would become inoperative.\n\nAt the time the pre-assessment notice was issued to Reyes, RA 8424 already stated that the taxpayer must be informed of both the law and facts on which the assessment was based. Thus, the CIR should have required the assessment officers of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to follow the clear mandate of the new law. The old regulation governing the issuance of estate tax assessment notices ran afoul of the rule that tax regulations -- old as they were -- should be in harmony with, and not supplant or modify, the law. [16]\n\nIt may be argued that the Tax Code provisions are not self-executory. It would be too wide a stretch of the imagination, though, to still issue a regulation that would simply require tax officials to inform the taxpayer, in any manner, of the law and the facts on which an assessment was based. That requirement is neither difficult to make nor its desired results hard to achieve.\n\nMoreover, an administrative rule interpretive of a statute, and not declarative of certain rights and corresponding obligations, is given retroactive effect as of the date of the effectivity of the statute. [17] RR 12-99 is one such rule. Being interpretive of the provisions of the Tax Code, even if it was issued only on September 6, 1999, this regulation was to retroact to January 1, 1998 -- a date prior to the issuance of the preliminary assessment notice and demand letter.\n\nThird , neither Section 229 nor RR 12-85 can prevail over Section 228 of the Tax Code.\n\nNo doubt, Section 228 has replaced Section 229. The provision on protesting an assessment has been amended. Furthermore, in case of discrepancy between the law as amended and its implementing but old regulation, the former necessarily prevails. [18] Thus, between Section 228 of the Tax Code and the pertinent provisions of RR 12-85, the latter cannot stand because it cannot go beyond the provision of the law. The law must still be followed, even though the existing tax regulation at that time provided for a different procedure. The regulation then simply provided that notice be sent to the respondent in the form prescribed, and that no consequence would ensue for failure to comply with that form.\n\nFourth, petitioner violated the cardinal rule in administrative law that the taxpayer be accorded due process. Not only was the law here disregarded, but no valid notice was sent, either. A void assessment bears no valid fruit.\n\nThe law imposes a substantive, not merely a formal, requirement. To proceed heedlessly with tax collection without first establishing a valid assessment is evidently violative of the cardinal principle in administrative investigations: that taxpayers should be able to present their case and adduce supporting evidence. [19] In the instant case, respondent has not been informed of the basis of the estate tax liability. Without complying with the unequivocal mandate of first informing the taxpayer of the government's claim, there can be no deprivation of property, because no effective protest can be made. [20] The haphazard shot at slapping an assessment, supposedly based on estate taxation's general provisions that are expected to be known by the taxpayer, is utter chicanery.\n\nEven a cursory review of the preliminary assessment notice, as well as the demand letter sent, reveals the lack of basis for -- not to mention the insufficiency of -- the gross figures and details of the itemized deductions indicated in the notice and the letter. This Court cannot countenance an assessment based on estimates that appear to have been arbitrarily or capriciously arrived at. Although taxes are\nthe lifeblood of the government, their assessment and collection \"should be made in accordance with law as any arbitrariness will negate the very reason for government itself.\" [21]\n\nFifth, the rule against estoppel does not apply. Although the government cannot be estopped by the negligence or omission of its agents, the obligatory provision on protesting a tax assessment cannot be rendered nugatory by a mere act of the CIR .\n\nTax laws are civil in nature. [22] Under our Civil Code, acts executed against the mandatory provisions of law are void, except when the law itself authorizes the validity of those acts. [23] Failure to comply with Section 228 does not only render the assessment void, but also finds no validation in any provision in the Tax Code. We cannot condone errant or enterprising tax officials, as they are expected to be vigilant and law-abiding.\n\nSecond Issue:\nValidity of Compromise\n\nIt would be premature for this Court to declare that the compromise on the estate tax liability has been perfected and consummated, considering the earlier determination that the assessment against the estate was void. Nothing has been settled or finalized. Under Section 204(A) of the Tax Code, where the basic tax involved exceeds one million pesos or the settlement offered is less than the prescribed minimum rates, the compromise shall be subject to the approval of the NEB composed of the petitioner and four deputy commissioners.\n\nFinally, as correctly held by the appellate court, this provision applies to all compromises, whether government-initiated or not. Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemos. Where the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby DENIED and the assailed Decision AFFIRMED . No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago , Austria-Martinez , Callejo Sr., and Chico-Nazario , JJ., concur.\n\n[1] The June 21, 2004 Resolution ordering the consolidation of GR No. 163581 with GR No. 159694 had been issued before the petitioner in the former case filed a Petition for Review. (GR No. 163581; rollo, p. 5.)\n\nAfterwards, per Resolution dated August 16, 2004, this Court denied the Petition for Review in GR No. 163581 for failure to comply with the requirements in Rules 46 and 56 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Lacking was an affidavit of service of copies on the CA and on the respondent, and a duplicate original or a certified true copy of the assailed Decision and Resolution. (GR No. 163581; rollo, pp. 80-81.)\n\nUltimately, per Resolution dated December 6, 2004, this Court denied with finality petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration in GR No. 163581 of the August 16, 2004 Resolution. (GR No. 163581; rollo, unnumbered after p. 105.)\n\n[2] GR No. 159694, rollo, pp. 8-40; GR No. 163581, rollo, pp. 7-20.\n\n[3] Eighth Division. Penned by Justice Edgardo P.

San Vicente and Associate Solicitor Sherri Lynn S. Cheng. Respondent's Memorandum, signed by Atty. Reynoso B. Floreza, was received by this Court on July 28, 2004.\n\n[11] GR No. 159694.

TEMPLONUEVO, RESPONDENTS.\nDECISION\nBANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, ANNABELLE A. SALAZAR, AND JULIO R. TEMPLONUEVO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nAZCUNA, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision [1] dated April 3, 1998, and the Resolution [2] dated November 9, 1998, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 42241.\n\nThe facts [3] are as follows:\n\nA.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services filed an action for a sum of money with damages against herein petitioner Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) on December 5, 1991 before Branch 156 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City. The complaint was later amended by substituting the name of Annabelle A. Salazar as the real party in interest in place of A.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services. Private respondent Salazar prayed for the recovery of the amount of Two Hundred Sixty-Seven Thousand, Seven Hundred Seven Pesos and Seventy Centavos (P267,707.70) debited by petitioner BPI from her account. She likewise prayed for damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nPetitioner BPI, in its answer, alleged that on August 31, 1991, Julio R. Templonuevo, third-party defendant and herein also a private respondent, demanded from the former payment of the amount of Two Hundred Sixty-Seven Thousand, Six Hundred Ninety-Two Pesos and Fifty Centavos (P267,692.50) representing the aggregate value of three (3) checks, which were allegedly payable to him, but which were deposited with the petitioner bank to private respondent Salazar\u2019s account (Account No. 0203-1187-67) without his knowledge and corresponding endorsement.\n\nAccepting that Templonuevo\u2019s claim was a valid one, petitioner BPI froze Account No. 0201-0588-48 of A.A. Salazar and Construction and Engineering Services, instead of Account No. 0203-1187-67 where the checks were deposited, since this account was already closed by private respondent Salazar or had an insufficient balance.\n\nPrivate respondent Salazar was advised to settle the matter with Templonuevo but they did not arrive at any settlement. As it appeared that private respondent Salazar was not entitled to the funds represented by the checks which were deposited and accepted for deposit, petitioner BPI decided to debit the amount of P267,707.70 from her Account No. 0201-0588-48 and the sum of P267,692.50 was paid to Templonuevo by means of a cashier\u2019s check. The difference between the value of the checks (P267,692.50) and the amount actually debited from her account (P267,707.70) represented bank charges in connection with the issuance of a cashier\u2019s check to Templonuevo.\n\nIn the answer to the third-party complaint, private respondent Templonuevo admitted the payment to him of P267,692.50 and argued that said payment was to correct the malicious deposit made by private respondent Salazar to her private account, and that petitioner bank\u2019s negligence and tolerance regarding the matter was violative of the primary and ordinary rules of banking. He likewise contended that the debiting or taking of the reimbursed amount from the account of private respondent Salazar by petitioner BPI was a matter exclusively between said parties and may be pursuant to banking rules and regulations, but did not in any way affect him. The debiting from another account of private respondent Salazar, considering that her other account was effectively closed, was not his concern.\n\nAfter trial, the RTC rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads thus:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff [private respondent Salazar] and against the defendant [petitioner BPI] and ordering the latter to pay as follows:\nThe amount of P267,707.70 with 12% interest thereon from September 16, 1991 until the said amount is fully paid; The amount of P30,000.00 as and for actual damages; The amount of P50,000.00 as and for moral damages; The amount of P50,000.00 as and for exemplary damages; The amount of P30,000.00 as and for attorney\u2019s fees; and Costs of suit. The counterclaim is hereby ordered DISMISSED for lack of factual basis.\n\nThe third-party complaint [filed by petitioner] is hereby likewise ordered DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nThird-party defendant\u2019s [i.e., private respondent Templonuevo\u2019s] counterclaim is hereby likewise DISMISSED for lack of factual basis.\n\nSO ORDERED. [4] On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision of the RTC and held that respondent Salazar was entitled to the proceeds of the three (3) checks notwithstanding the lack of endorsement thereon by the payee. The CA concluded that Salazar and Templonuevo had previously agreed that the checks payable to JRT Construction and Trading [5] actually belonged to Salazar and would be deposited to her account, with petitioner acquiescing to the arrangement. [6]\n\nPetitioner therefore filed this petition on these grounds:\nI.\nThe Court of Appeals committed reversible error in misinterpreting Section 49 of the Negotiable Instruments Law and Section 3 (r and s) of Rule 131 of the New Rules on Evidence.\n\nII.\nThe Court of Appeals committed reversible error in NOT applying the provisions of Articles 22, 1278 and 1290 of the Civil Code in favor of BPI.\n\nIII.\nThe Court of Appeals committed a reversible error in holding, based on a misapprehension of facts, that the account from which BPI debited the amount of P267,707.70 belonged to a corporation with a separate and distinct personality.\n\nIV.\nThe Court of Appeals committed a reversible error in holding, based entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures, that there was an agreement between SALAZAR and TEMPLONUEVO that checks payable to TEMPLONUEVO may be deposited by SALAZAR to her personal account and that BPI was privy to this agreement.\n\nV.\nThe Court of Appeals committed reversible error in holding, based entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures, that SALAZAR suffered great damage and prejudice and that her business standing was eroded.\n\nVI.\nThe Court of Appeals erred in affirming instead of reversing the decision of the lower court against BPI and dismissing SALAZAR\u2019s complaint.\n\nVII.\nThe Honorable Court erred in affirming the decision of the lower court dismissing the third-party complaint of BPI. [7] The issues center on the propriety of the deductions made by petitioner from private respondent Salazar\u2019s account. Stated otherwise, does a collecting bank, over the objections of its depositor, have the authority to withdraw unilaterally from such depositor\u2019s account the amount it had previously paid upon certain unendorsed order instruments deposited by the depositor to another account that she later closed?\n\nPetitioner argues thus:\nThere is no presumption in law that a check payable to order, when found in the possession of a person who is neither a payee nor the indorsee thereof, has been lawfully transferred for value. Hence, the CA should not have presumed that Salazar was a transferee for value within the contemplation of Section 49 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, [8] as the latter applies only to a holder defined under Section 191of the same. [9]\n\nSalazar failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that her possession of the three checks was lawful despite her allegations that these checks were deposited pursuant to a prior internal arrangement with Templonuevo and that petitioner was privy to the arrangement.\n\nThe CA should have applied the Civil Code provisions on legal compensation because in deducting the subject amount from Salazar\u2019s account, petitioner was merely rectifying the undue payment it made upon the checks and exercising its prerogative to alter or modify an erroneous credit entry in the regular course of its business.\n\nThe debit of the amount from the account of A.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services was proper even though the value of the checks had been originally credited to the personal account of Salazar because A.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services, an unincorporated single proprietorship, had no separate and distinct personality from Salazar.\n\nAssuming the deduction from Salazar\u2019s account was improper, the CA should not have dismissed petitioner\u2019s third-party complaint against Templonuevo because the latter would have the legal duty to return to petitioner the proceeds of the checks which he previously received from it.\n\nThere was no factual basis for the award of damages to Salazar. The petition is partly meritorious.\n\nFirst, the issue raised by petitioner requires an inquiry into the factual findings made by the CA. The CA\u2019s conclusion that the deductions from the bank account of A.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services were improper stemmed from its finding that there was no ineffective payment to Salazar which would call for the exercise of petitioner\u2019s right to set off against the former\u2019s bank deposits. This finding, in turn, was drawn from the pleadings of the parties, the evidence adduced during trial and upon the admissions and stipulations of fact made during the pre-trial, most significantly the following:\n\n(a) That Salazar previously had in her possession the following checks:\n(1) Solid Bank Check No. CB766556 dated January 30, 1990 in the amount of P57,712.50;\n(2) Solid Bank Check No. CB898978 dated July 31, 1990 in the amount of P55,180.00; and,\n(3) Equitable Banking Corporation Check No. 32380638 dated August 28, 1990 for the amount of P154,800.00; (b) That these checks which had an aggregate amount of P267,692.50 were payable to the order of JRT Construction and Trading, the name and style under which Templonuevo does business;\n\n(c) That despite the lack of endorsement of the designated payee upon such checks, Salazar was able to deposit the checks in her personal savings account with petitioner and encash the same;\n\n(d) That petitioner accepted and paid the checks on three (3) separate occasions over a span of eight months in 1990; and\n\n(e) That Templonuevo only protested the purportedly unauthorized encashment of the checks after the lapse of one year from the date of the last check. [10]\n\nPetitioner concedes that when it credited the value of the checks to the account of private respondent Salazar, it made a mistake because it failed to notice the lack of endorsement thereon by the designated payee. The CA, however, did not lend credence to this claim and concluded that petitioner\u2019s actions were deliberate, in view of its admission that the \u201cmistake\u201d was committed three times on three separate occasions, indicating acquiescence to the internal arrangement between Salazar and Templonuevo. The CA explained thus:\nIt was quite apparent that the three checks which appellee Salazar deposited were not indorsed. Three times she deposited them to her account and three times the amounts borne by these checks were credited to the same. And in those separate occasions, the bank did not return the checks to her so that she could have them indorsed. Neither did the bank question her as to why she was depositing the checks to her account considering that she was not the payee thereof, thus allowing us to come to the conclusion that defendant-appellant BPI was fully aware that the proceeds of the three checks belong to appellee.\n\nFor if the bank was not privy to the agreement between Salazar and Templonuevo, it is most unlikely that appellant BPI (or any bank for that matter) would have accepted the checks for deposit on three separate times nary any question. Banks are most finicky over accepting checks for deposit without the corresponding indorsement by their payee. In fact, they hesitate to accept indorsed checks for deposit if the depositor is not one they know very well. [11] The CA likewise sustained Salazar\u2019s position that she received the checks from Templonuevo pursuant to an internal arrangement between them, ratiocinating as follows:\nIf there was indeed no arrangement between Templonuevo and the plaintiff over the three questioned checks, it baffles us why it was only on August 31, 1991 or more than a year after the third and last check was deposited that he demanded for the refund of the total amount of P267,692.50.\n\nA prudent man knowing that payment is due him would have demanded payment by his debtor from the moment the same became due and demandable. More so if the sum involved runs in hundreds of thousand of pesos. By and large, every person, at the very moment he learns that he was deprived of a thing which rightfully belongs to him, would have created a big fuss. He would not have waited for a year within which to do so. It is most inconceivable that Templonuevo did not do this. [12] Generally, only questions of law may be raised in an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. [13] Factual findings of the CA are entitled to great weight and respect, especially when the CA affirms the factual findings of the trial court. [14] Such questions on whether certain items of evidence should be accorded probative value or weight, or rejected as feeble or spurious, or whether or not the proofs on one side or the other are clear and convincing and adequate to establish a proposition in issue, are questions of fact. The same holds true for questions on whether or not the body of proofs presented by a party, weighed and analyzed in relation to contrary evidence submitted by the adverse party may be said to be strong, clear and convincing, or whether or not inconsistencies in the body of proofs of a party are of such gravity as to justify refusing to give said proofs weight \u2013 all these are issues of fact which are not reviewable by the Court. [15]\n\nThis rule, however, is not absolute and admits of certain exceptions, namely: a) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises, or conjectures; b) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; c) when there is a grave abuse of discretion; d) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; e) when the findings of fact are conflicting; f) when the CA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; g) when the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; h) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; i) when the finding of fact of the CA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence but is contradicted by the evidence on record; and j) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. [16]\n\nIn the present case, the records do not support the finding made by the CA and the trial court that a prior arrangement existed between Salazar and Templonuevo regarding the transfer of ownership of the checks. This fact is crucial as Salazar\u2019s entitlement to the value of the instruments is based on the assumption that she is a transferee within the contemplation of Section 49 of the Negotiable Instruments Law.\n\nSection 49 of the Negotiable Instruments Law contemplates a situation whereby the payee or indorsee delivers a negotiable instrument for value without indorsing it, thus:\nTransfer without indorsement; effect of - Where the holder of an instrument payable to his order transfers it for value without indorsing it, the transfer vests in the transferee such title as the transferor had therein, and the transferee acquires in addition, the right to have the indorsement of the transferor. But for the purpose of determining whether the transferee is a holder in due course, the negotiation takes effect as of the time when the indorsement is actually made. [17] It bears stressing that the above transaction is an equitable assignment and the transferee acquires the instrument subject to defenses and equities available among prior parties. Thus, if the transferor had legal title, the transferee acquires such title and, in addition, the right to have the indorsement of the transferor and also the right, as holder of the legal title, to maintain legal action against the maker or acceptor or other party liable to the transferor. The underlying premise of this provision, however, is that a valid transfer of ownership of the negotiable instrument in question has taken place.\n\nTransferees in this situation do not enjoy the presumption of ownership in favor of holders since they are neither payees nor indorsees of such instruments. The weight of authority is that the mere possession of a negotiable instrument does not in itself conclusively establish either the right of the possessor to receive payment, or of the right of one who has made payment to be discharged from liability. Thus, something more than mere possession by persons who are not payees or indorsers of the instrument is necessary to authorize payment to them in the absence of any other facts from which the authority to receive payment may be inferred. [18]\n\nThe CA and the trial court surmised that the subject checks belonged to private respondent Salazar based on the pre-trial stipulation that Templonuevo incurred a one-year delay in demanding reimbursement for the proceeds of the same. To the Court\u2019s mind, however, such period of delay is not of such unreasonable length as to estop Templonuevo from asserting ownership over the checks especially considering that it was readily apparent on the face of the instruments [19] that these were crossed checks.\n\nIn State Investment House v. IAC , [20] the Court enumerated the effects of crossing a check, thus: (1) that the check may not be encashed but only deposited in the bank; (2) that the check may be negotiated only once - to one who has an account with a bank; and (3) that the act of crossing the check serves as a warning to the holder that the check has been issued for a definite purpose so that such holder must inquire if the check has been received pursuant to that purpose.\n\nThus, even if the delay in the demand for reimbursement is taken in conjunction with Salazar\u2019s possession of the checks, it cannot be said that the presumption of ownership in Templonuevo\u2019s favor as the designated payee therein was sufficiently overcome. This is consistent with the principle that if instruments payable to named payees or to their order have not been indorsed in blank, only such payees or their indorsees can be holders and entitled to receive payment in their own right. [21]\n\nThe presumption under Section 131(s) of the Rules of Court stating that a negotiable instrument was given for a sufficient consideration will not inure to the benefit of Salazar because the term \u201cgiven\u201d does not pertain merely to a transfer of physical possession of the instrument. The phrase \u201cgiven or indorsed\u201d in the context of a negotiable instrument refers to the manner in which such instrument may be negotiated. Negotiable instruments are negotiated by \u201ctransfer to one person or another in such a manner as to constitute the transferee the holder thereof. If payable to bearer it is negotiated by delivery. If payable to order it is negotiated by the indorsement completed by delivery.\u201d [22] The present case involves checks payable to order. Not being a payee or indorsee of the checks, private respondent Salazar could not be a holder thereof.\n\nIt is an exception to the general rule for a payee of an order instrument to transfer the instrument without indorsement. Precisely because the situation is abnormal, it is but fair to the maker and to prior holders to require possessors to prove without the aid of an initial presumption in their favor, that they came into possession by virtue of a legitimate transaction with the last holder. [23] Salazar failed to discharge this burden, and the return of the check proceeds to Templonuevo was therefore warranted under the circumstances despite the fact that Templonuevo may not have clearly demonstrated that he never authorized Salazar to deposit the checks or to encash the same. Noteworthy also is the fact that petitioner stamped on the back of the checks the words: \"All prior endorsements and/or lack of endorsements guaranteed,\" thereby making the assurance that it had ascertained the genuineness of all prior endorsements. Having assumed the liability of a general indorser, petitioner\u2019s liability to the designated payee cannot be denied.\n\nConsequently, petitioner, as the collecting bank, had the right to debit Salazar\u2019s account for the value of the checks it previously credited in her favor. It is of no moment that the account debited by petitioner was different from the original account to which the proceeds of the check were credited because both admittedly belonged to Salazar, the former being the account of the sole proprietorship which had no separate and distinct personality from her, and the latter being her personal account.\n\nThe right of set-off was explained in Associated Bank v. Tan : [24]\nA bank generally has a right of set-off over the deposits therein for the payment of any withdrawals on the part of a depositor. The right of a collecting bank to debit a client's account for the value of a dishonored check that has previously been credited has fairly been established by jurisprudence. To begin with, Article 1980 of the Civil Code provides that \"[f]ixed, savings, and current deposits of money in banks and similar institutions shall be governed by the provisions concerning simple loan.\u201d\n\nHence, the relationship between banks and depositors has been held to be that of creditor and debtor. Thus, legal compensation under Article 1278 of the Civil Code may take place \"when all the requisites mentioned in Article 1279 are present,\" as follows:\n(1) That each one of the obligors be bound principally, and that he be at the same time a principal creditor of the other;\n(2) That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the things due are consumable, they be of the same kind, and also of the same quality if the latter has been stated;\n(3) That the two debts be due;\n(4) That they be liquidated and demandable;\n(5) That over neither of them there be any retention or controversy, commenced by third persons and communicated in due time to the debtor. While, however, it is conceded that petitioner had the right of set-off over the amount it paid to Templonuevo against the deposit of Salazar, the issue of whether it acted judiciously is an entirely different matter. [25] As businesses affected with public interest, and because of the nature of their functions, banks are under obligation to treat the accounts of their depositors with meticulous care, always having in mind the fiduciary nature of their relationship. [26] In this regard, petitioner was clearly remiss in its duty to private respondent Salazar as its depositor.\n\nTo begin with, the irregularity appeared plainly on the face of the checks. Despite the obvious lack of indorsement thereon, petitioner permitted the encashment of these checks three times on three separate occasions. This negates petitioner\u2019s claim that it merely made a mistake in crediting the value of the checks to Salazar\u2019s account and instead bolsters the conclusion of the CA that petitioner recognized Salazar\u2019s claim of ownership of checks and acted deliberately in paying the same, contrary to ordinary banking policy and practice. It must be emphasized that the law imposes a duty of diligence on the collecting bank to scrutinize checks deposited with it, for the purpose of determining their genuineness and regularity. The collecting bank, being primarily engaged in banking, holds itself out to the public as the expert on this field, and the law thus holds it to a high standard of conduct. [27] The taking and collection of a check without the proper indorsement amount to a conversion of the check by the bank. [28]\n\nMore importantly, however, solely upon the prompting of Templonuevo, and with full knowledge of the brewing dispute between Salazar and Templonuevo, petitioner debited the account held in the name of the sole proprietorship of Salazar without even serving due notice upon her. This ran contrary to petitioner\u2019s assurances to private respondent Salazar that the account would remain untouched, pending the resolution of the controversy between her and Templonuevo. [29] In this connection, the CA cited the letter dated September 5, 1991 of Mr. Manuel Ablan, Senior Manager of petitioner bank\u2019s Pasig/Ortigas branch, to private respondent Salazar informing her that her account had been frozen, thus:\nFrom the tenor of the letter of Manuel Ablan, it is safe to conclude that Account No. 0201-0588-48 will remain frozen or untouched until herein [Salazar] has settled matters with Templonuevo. But, in an unexpected move, in less than two weeks (eleven days to be precise) from the time that letter was written, [petitioner] bank issued a cashier\u2019s check in the name of Julio R. Templonuevo of the J.R.T. Construction and Trading for the sum of P267,692.50 (Exhibit \u201c8\u201d) and debited said amount from Ms. Arcilla\u2019s account No. 0201-0588-48 which was supposed to be frozen or controlled. Such a move by BPI is, to Our minds, a clear case of negligence, if not a fraudulent, wanton and reckless disregard of the right of its depositor. The records further bear out the fact that respondent Salazar had issued several checks drawn against the account of A.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services prior to any notice of deduction being served. The CA sustained private respondent Salazar\u2019s claim of damages in this regard:\nThe act of the bank in freezing and later debiting the amount of P267,692.50 from the account of A.A. Salazar Construction and Engineering Services caused plaintiff-appellee great damage and prejudice particularly when she had already issued checks drawn against the said account. As can be expected, the said checks bounced. To prove this, plaintiff-appellee presented as exhibits photocopies of checks dated September 8, 1991, October 28, 1991, and November 14, 1991 (Exhibits \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d respectively) [30] These checks, it must be emphasized, were subsequently dishonored, thereby causing private respondent Salazar undue embarrassment and inflicting damage to her standing in the business community. Under the circumstances, she was clearly not given the opportunity to protect her interest when petitioner unilaterally withdrew the above amount from her account without informing her that it had already done so.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court finds no reason to disturb the award of damages granted by the CA against petitioner. This whole incident would have been avoided had petitioner adhered to the standard of diligence expected of one engaged in the banking business. A depositor has the right to recover reasonable moral damages even if the bank\u2019s negligence may not have been attended with malice and bad faith, if the former suffered mental anguish, serious anxiety, embarrassment and humiliation. [31] Moral damages are not meant to enrich a complainant at the expense of defendant. It is only intended to alleviate the moral suffering she has undergone. The award of exemplary damages is justified, on the other hand, when the acts of the bank are attended by malice, bad faith or gross negligence. The award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is proper where exemplary damages are awarded. It is proper where depositors are compelled to litigate to protect their interest. [32]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is partially GRANTED . The assailed Decision dated April 3, 1998 and Resolution dated April 3, 1998 rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

MODESTO CALAUNAN, RESPONDENT. \nD E C I S I O N\nMAURICIO MANLICLIC AND PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS LINES, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. MODESTO CALAUNAN, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nAssailed before Us is the decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 55909 which affirmed in toto the decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dagupan City, Branch 42, in Civil Case No. D-10086, finding petitioners Mauricio Manliclic and Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. (PRBLI) solidarily liable to pay damages and attorney\u2019s fees to respondent Modesto Calaunan.\n\nThe factual antecedents are as follows:\n\nThe vehicles involved in this case are: (1) Philippine Rabbit Bus No. 353 with plate number CVD-478, owned by petitioner PRBLI and driven by petitioner Mauricio Manliclic; and (2) owner-type jeep with plate number PER-290, owned by respondent Modesto Calaunan and driven by Marcelo Mendoza.\n\nAt around 6:00 to 7:00 o\u2019clock in the morning of 12 July 1988, respondent Calaunan, together with Marcelo Mendoza, was on his way to Manila from Pangasinan on board his owner-type jeep. The Philippine Rabbit Bus was likewise bound for Manila from Concepcion, Tarlac. At approximately Kilometer 40 of the North Luzon Expressway in Barangay Lalangan, Plaridel, Bulacan, the two vehicles collided. The front right side of the Philippine Rabbit Bus hit the rear left side of the jeep causing the latter to move to the shoulder on the right and then fall on a ditch with water resulting to further extensive damage. The bus veered to the left and stopped 7 to 8 meters from point of collision.\n\nRespondent suffered minor injuries while his driver was unhurt. He was first brought for treatment to the Manila Central University Hospital in Kalookan City by Oscar Buan, the conductor of the Philippine Rabbit Bus, and was later transferred to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center.\n\nBy reason of such collision, a criminal case was filed before the RTC of Malolos, Bulacan, charging petitioner Manliclic with Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Damage to Property with Physical Injuries, docketed as Crim. Case No. 684-M-89. Subsequently on 2 December 1991, respondent filed a complaint for damages against petitioners Manliclic and PRBLI before the RTC of Dagupan City, docketed as Civil Case No. D-10086. The criminal case was tried ahead of the civil case. Among those who testified in the criminal case were respondent Calaunan, Marcelo Mendoza and Fernando Ramos.\n\nIn the civil case (now before this Court), the parties admitted the following:\nThe parties agreed on the capacity of the parties to sue and be sued as well as the venue and the identities of the vehicles involved;\n\nThe identity of the drivers and the fact that they are duly licensed;\n\nThe date and place of the vehicular collision;\n\nThe extent of the injuries suffered by plaintiff Modesto Calaunan and the existence of the medical certificate;\n\nThat both vehicles were going towards the south; the private jeep being ahead of the bus;\n\nThat the weather was fair and the road was well paved and straight, although there was a ditch on the right side where the jeep fell into. [3] When the civil case was heard, counsel for respondent prayed that the transcripts of stenographic notes (TSNs) [4] of the testimonies of respondent Calaunan, Marcelo Mendoza and Fernando Ramos in the criminal case be received in evidence in the civil case in as much as these witnesses are not available to testify in the civil case.\n\nFrancisco Tuliao testified that his brother-in-law, respondent Calaunan, left for abroad sometime in November, 1989 and has not returned since then. Rogelio Ramos took the stand and said that his brother, Fernando Ramos, left for Amman, Jordan, to work. Rosalia Mendoza testified that her husband, Marcelo Mendoza, left their residence to look for a job. She narrated that she thought her husband went to his hometown in Panique, Tarlac, when he did not return after one month. She went to her husband\u2019s hometown to look for him but she was informed that he did not go there.\n\nThe trial court subpoenaed the Clerk of Court of Branch 8, RTC, Malolos, Bulacan, the court where Criminal Case No. 684-M-89 was tried, to bring the TSNs of the testimonies of respondent Calaunan, [5] Marcelo Mendoza [6] and Fernando Ramos [7] in said case, together with other documentary evidence marked therein. Instead of the Branch Clerk of Court, it was Enrique Santos Guevara, Court Interpreter, who appeared before the court and identified the TSNs of the three afore-named witnesses and other pertinent documents he had brought. [8] Counsel for respondent wanted to mark other TSNs and documents from the said criminal case to be adopted in the instant case, but since the same were not brought to the trial court, counsel for petitioners compromised that said TSNs and documents could be offered by counsel for respondent as rebuttal evidence.\n\nFor the defendants, petitioner Manliclic and bus conductor Oscar Buan testified. The TSN [9] of the testimony of Donato Ganiban, investigator of the PRBLI, in Criminal Case No. 684-M-89 was marked and allowed to be adopted in the civil case on the ground that he was already dead.\n\nRespondent further marked, among other documents, as rebuttal evidence, the TSNs [10] of the testimonies of Donato Ganiban, Oscar Buan and petitioner Manliclic in Criminal Case No. 684-M-89.\n\nThe disagreement arises from the question: Who is to be held liable for the collision?\n\nRespondent insists it was petitioner Manliclic who should be liable while the latter is resolute in saying it was the former who caused the smash up.\n\nThe versions of the parties are summarized by the trial court as follows:\nThe parties differed only on the manner the collision between the two (2) vehicles took place. According to the plaintiff and his driver, the jeep was cruising at the speed of 60 to 70 kilometers per hour on the slow lane of the expressway when the Philippine Rabbit Bus overtook the jeep and in the process of overtaking the jeep, the Philippine Rabbit Bus hit the rear of the jeep on the left side. At the time the Philippine Rabbit Bus hit the jeep, it was about to overtake the jeep. In other words, the Philippine Rabbit Bus was still at the back of the jeep when the jeep was hit. Fernando Ramos corroborated the testimony of the plaintiff and Marcelo Mendoza. He said that he was on another jeep following the Philippine Rabbit Bus and the jeep of plaintiff when the incident took place. He said, the jeep of the plaintiff overtook them and the said jeep of the plaintiff was followed by the Philippine Rabbit Bus which was running very fast. The bus also overtook the jeep in which he was riding. After that, he heard a loud sound. He saw the jeep of the plaintiff swerved to the right on a grassy portion of the road. The Philippine Rabbit Bus stopped and they overtook the Philippine Rabbit Bus so that it could not moved (sic), meaning they stopped in front of the Philippine Rabbit Bus. He testified that the jeep of plaintiff swerved to the right because it was bumped by the Philippine Rabbit bus from behind.\n\nBoth Mauricio Manliclic and his driver, Oscar Buan admitted that the Philippine Rabbit Bus bumped the jeep in question. However, they explained that when the Philippine Rabbit bus was about to go to the left lane to overtake the jeep, the latter jeep swerved to the left because it was to overtake another jeep in front of it. Such was their testimony before the RTC in Malolos in the criminal case and before this Court in the instant case. [Thus, which of the two versions of the manner how the collision took place was correct, would be determinative of who between the two drivers was negligent in the operation of their respective vehicles.] [11] Petitioner PRBLI maintained that it observed and exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its employee, specifically petitioner Manliclic.\n\nOn 22 July 1996, the trial court rendered its decision in favor of respondent Calaunan and against petitioners Manliclic and PRBLI. The dispositive portion of its decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants ordering the said defendants to pay plaintiff jointly and solidarily the amount of P40,838.00 as actual damages for the towing as well as the repair and the materials used for the repair of the jeep in question; P100,000.00 as moral damages and another P100,000.00 as exemplary damages and P15,000.00 as attorney\u2019s fees, including appearance fees of the lawyer. In addition, the defendants are also to pay costs. [12] Petitioners appealed the decision via Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals. [13]\n\nIn a decision dated 28 September 2001, the Court of Appeals, finding no reversible error in the decision of the trial court, affirmed it in all respects. [14]\n\nPetitioners are now before us by way of petition for review assailing the decision of the Court of Appeals. They assign as errors the following:\nI\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S QUESTIONABLE ADMISSION IN EVIDENCE OF THE TSN\u2019s AND OTHER DOCUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE CRIMINAL CASE.\n\nII\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RELIANCE ON THE VERSION OF THE RESPONDENT ON HOW THE ACCIDENT SUPPOSEDLY OCCURRED.\n\nIII\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S UNFAIR DISREGARD OF HEREIN PETITIONER PRBL\u2019s DEFENSE OF EXERCISE OF DUE DILIGENCE IN THE SELECTION AND SUPERVISION OF ITS EMPLOYEES.\n\nIV\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S QUESTIONABLE AWARD OF DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY\u2019S FEE. With the passing away of respondent Calaunan during the pendency of this appeal with this Court, we granted the Motion for the Substitution of Respondent filed by his wife, Mrs. Precila Zarate Vda. De Calaunan, and children, Virgilio Calaunan, Carmelita Honeycomb, Evelyn Calaunan, Marko Calaunan and Liwayway Calaunan. [15]\n\nIn their Reply to respondent\u2019s Comment, petitioners informed this Court of a Decision [16] of the Court of Appeals acquitting petitioner Manliclic of the charge [17] of Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Damage to Property with Physical Injuries attaching thereto a photocopy thereof.\n\nOn the first assigned error, petitioners argue that the TSNs containing the testimonies of respondent Calaunan, [18] Marcelo Mendoza [19] and Fernando Ramos [20] should not be admitted in evidence for failure of respondent to comply with the requisites of Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.\n\nFor Section 47, Rule 130 [21] to apply, the following requisites must be satisfied: (a) the witness is dead or unable to testify; (b) his testimony or deposition was given in a former case or proceeding, judicial or administrative, between the same parties or those representing the same interests; (c) the former case involved the same subject as that in the present case, although on different causes of action; (d) the issue testified to by the witness in the former trial is the same issue involved in the present case; and (e) the adverse party had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness in the former case. [22]\n\nAdmittedly, respondent failed to show the concurrence of all the requisites set forth by the Rules for a testimony given in a former case or proceeding to be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Petitioner PRBLI, not being a party in Criminal Case No. 684-M-89, had no opportunity to cross-examine the three witnesses in said case. The criminal case was filed exclusively against petitioner Manliclic, petitioner PRBLI\u2019s employee. The cases dealing with the subsidiary liability of employers uniformly declare that, strictly speaking, they are not parties to the criminal cases instituted against their employees. [23]\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that petitioner PRBLI was not a party in said criminal case, the testimonies of the three witnesses are still admissible on the ground that petitioner PRBLI failed to object on their admissibility.\n\nIt is elementary that an objection shall be made at the time when an alleged inadmissible document is offered in evidence; otherwise, the objection shall be treated as waived, since the right to object is merely a privilege which the party may waive. Thus, a failure to except to the evidence because it does not conform to the statute is a waiver of the provisions of the law. Even assuming ex gratia argumenti that these documents are inadmissible for being hearsay, but on account of failure to object thereto, the same may be admitted and considered as sufficient to prove the facts therein asserted. [24] Hearsay evidence alone may be insufficient to establish a fact in a suit but, when no objection is made thereto, it is, like any other evidence, to be considered and given the importance it deserves. [25]\n\nIn the case at bar, petitioner PRBLI did not object to the TSNs containing the testimonies of respondent Calaunan, Marcelo Mendoza and Fernando Ramos in the criminal case when the same were offered in evidence in the trial court. In fact, the TSNs of the testimonies of Calaunan and Mendoza were admitted by both petitioners. [26] Moreover, petitioner PRBLI even offered in evidence the TSN containing the testimony of Donato Ganiban in the criminal case. If petitioner PRBLI argues that the TSNs of the testimonies of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses in the criminal case should not be admitted in the instant case, why then did it offer the TSN of the testimony of Ganiban which was given in the criminal case? It appears that petitioner PRBLI wants to have its cake and eat it too. It cannot argue that the TSNs of the testimonies of the witnesses of the adverse party in the criminal case should not be admitted and at the same time insist that the TSN of the testimony of the witness for the accused be admitted in its favor. To disallow admission in evidence of the TSNs of the testimonies of Calaunan, Marcelo Mendoza and Fernando Ramos in the criminal case and to admit the TSN of the testimony of Ganiban would be unfair.\n\nWe do not subscribe to petitioner PRBLI\u2019s argument that it will be denied due process when the TSNs of the testimonies of Calaunan, Marcelo Mendoza and Fernando Ramos in the criminal case are to be admitted in the civil case. It is too late for petitioner PRBLI to raise denial of due process in relation to Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, as a ground for objecting to the admissibility of the TSNs. For failure to object at the proper time, it waived its right to object that the TSNs did not comply with Section 47.\n\nIn Mangio v. Court of Appeals , [27] this Court, through Associate Justice Reynato S. Puno, [28] admitted in evidence a TSN of the testimony of a witness in another case despite therein petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be denied due process. In admitting the TSN, the Court ruled that the raising of denial of due process in relation to Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, as a ground for objecting to the admissibility of the TSN was belatedly done. In so doing, therein petitioner waived his right to object based on said ground.\n\nPetitioners contend that the documents in the criminal case should not have been admitted in the instant civil case because Section 47 of Rule 130 refers only to \u201ctestimony or deposition.\u201d We find such contention to be untenable. Though said section speaks only of testimony and deposition, it does not mean that documents from a former case or proceeding cannot be admitted. Said documents can be admitted they being part of the testimonies of witnesses that have been admitted. Accordingly, they shall be given the same weight as that to which the testimony may be entitled. [29]\n\nOn the second assigned error, petitioners contend that the version of petitioner Manliclic as to how the accident occurred is more credible than respondent\u2019s version. They anchor their contention on the fact that petitioner Manliclic was acquitted by the Court of Appeals of the charge of Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Damage to Property with Physical Injuries.\n\nTo be resolved by the Court is the effect of petitioner Manliclic\u2019s acquittal in the civil case.\n\nFrom the complaint, it can be gathered that the civil case for damages was one arising from, or based on, quasi-delict. [30] Petitioner Manliclic was sued for his negligence or reckless imprudence in causing the collision, while petitioner PRBLI was sued for its failure to exercise the diligence of a good father in the selection and supervision of its employees, particularly petitioner Manliclic. The allegations read:\n\u201c4. That sometime on July 12, 1988 at around 6:20 A.M. plaintiff was on board the above-described motor vehicle travelling at a moderate speed along the North Luzon Expressway heading South towards Manila together with MARCELO MENDOZA, who was then driving the same;\n\n\u201c5. That approximately at kilometer 40 of the North Luzon Express Way, the above-described motor vehicle was suddenly bumped from behind by a Philippine Rabbit Bus with Body No. 353 and with plate No. CVD 478 then being driven by one Mauricio Manliclic of San Jose, Concepcion, Tarlac, who was then travelling recklessly at a very fast speed and had apparently lost control of his vehicle;\n\n\u201c6. That as a result of the impact of the collision the above-described motor vehicle was forced off the North Luzon Express Way towards the rightside where it fell on its driver\u2019s side on a ditch, and that as a consequence, the above-described motor vehicle which maybe valued at EIGHTY THOUSAND PESOS (P80,000) was rendered a total wreck as shown by pictures to be presented during the pre-trial and trial of this case;\n\n\u201c7. That also as a result of said incident, plaintiff sustained bodily injuries which compounded plaintiff\u2019s frail physical condition and required his hospitalization from July 12, 1988 up to and until July 22, 1988, copy of the medical certificate is hereto attached as Annex \u201cA\u201d and made an integral part hereof;\n\n\u201c8. That the vehicular collision resulting in the total wreckage of the above-described motor vehicle as well as bodily (sic) sustained by plaintiff, was solely due to the reckless imprudence of the defendant driver Mauricio Manliclic who drove his Philippine Rabbit Bus No. 353 at a fast speed without due regard or observance of existing traffic rules and regulations;\n\n\u201c9. That defendant Philippine Rabbit Bus Line Corporation failed to exercise the diligence of a good father of (sic) family in the selection and supervision of its drivers; x x x\u201d [31] Can Manliclic still be held liable for the collision and be found negligent notwithstanding the declaration of the Court of Appeals that there was an absence of negligence on his part?\n\nIn exonerating petitioner Manliclic in the criminal case, the Court of Appeals said:\nTo the following findings of the court a quo , to wit: that accused-appellant was negligent \u201cwhen the bus he was driving bumped the jeep from behind\u201d; that \u201cthe proximate cause of the accident was his having driven the bus at a great speed while closely following the jeep\u201d; x x x\n\nWe do not agree.\n\nThe swerving of Calaunan\u2019s jeep when it tried to overtake the vehicle in front of it was beyond the control of accused-appellant.\n\nx x x x\n\nAbsent evidence of negligence, therefore, accused-appellant cannot be held liable for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Damage to Property with Physical Injuries as defined in Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code. [32] From the foregoing declaration of the Court of Appeals, it appears that petitioner Manliclic was acquitted not on reasonable doubt, but on the ground that he is not the author of the act complained of which is based on Section 2(b) of Rule 111 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure which reads:\n(b) Extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist. In spite of said ruling, petitioner Manliclic can still be held liable for the mishap. The afore-quoted section applies only to a civil action arising from crime or ex delicto and not to a civil action arising from quasi-delict or culpa aquiliana . The extinction of civil liability referred to in Par. (e) of Section 3, Rule 111 [now Section 2 (b) of Rule 111], refers exclusively to civil liability founded on Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code, whereas the civil liability for the same act considered as a quasi-delict only and not as a crime is not extinguished even by a declaration in the criminal case that the criminal act charged has not happened or has not been committed by the accused. [33]\n\nA quasi-delict or culpa aquiliana is a separate legal institution under the Civil Code with a substantivity all its own, and individuality that is entirely apart and independent from a delict or crime \u2013 a distinction exists between the civil liability arising from a crime and the responsibility for quasi-delicts or culpa extra-contractual . The same negligence causing damages may produce civil liability arising from a crime under the Penal Code, or create an action for quasi-delicts or culpa extra-contractual under the Civil Code. [34] It is now settled that acquittal of the accused, even if based on a finding that he is not guilty, does not carry with it the extinction of the civil liability based on quasi delict. [35]\n\nIn other words, if an accused is acquitted based on reasonable doubt on his guilt, his civil liability arising from the crime may be proved by preponderance of evidence only. However, if an accused is acquitted on the basis that he was not the author of the act or omission complained of (or that there is declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist), said acquittal closes the door to civil liability based on the crime or ex delicto . In this second instance, there being no crime or delict to speak of, civil liability based thereon or ex delicto is not possible. In this case, a civil action, if any, may be instituted on grounds other than the delict complained of.\n\nAs regards civil liability arising from quasi-delict or culpa aquiliana , same will not be extinguished by an acquittal, whether it be on ground of reasonable doubt or that accused was not the author of the act or omission complained of (or that there is declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil liability might arise did not exist). The responsibility arising from fault or negligence in a quasi-delict is entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal Code. [36] An acquittal or conviction in the criminal case is entirely irrelevant in the civil case [37] based on quasi-delict or culpa aquiliana .\n\nPetitioners ask us to give credence to their version of how the collision occurred and to disregard that of respondent\u2019s. Petitioners insist that while the PRBLI bus was in the process of overtaking respondent\u2019s jeep, the latter, without warning, suddenly swerved to the left (fast) lane in order to overtake another jeep ahead of it, thus causing the collision.\n\nAs a general rule, questions of fact may not be raised in a petition for review.\u00a0 The factual findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the appellate court, are binding and conclusive on the Supreme Court. [38] Not being a trier of facts, this Court will not allow a review thereof unless:\n(1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise and conjecture; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case and its findings are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellees; (7) the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) said findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record. [39] After going over the evidence on record, we do not find any of the exceptions that would warrant our departure from the general rule. We fully agree in the finding of the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that it was petitioner Manliclic who was negligent in driving the PRBLI bus which was the cause of the collision. In giving credence to the version of the respondent, the trial court has this say:\nx x x Thus, which of the two versions of the manner how the collision took place was correct, would be determinative of who between the two drivers was negligent in the operation of their respective vehicle.\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that in the statement of Mauricio Manliclic (Exh. 15) given to the Philippine Rabbit Investigator CV Cabading no mention was made by him about the fact that the driver of the jeep was overtaking another jeep when the collision took place. The allegation that another jeep was being overtaken by the jeep of Calaunan was testified to by him only in Crim. Case No. 684-M-89 before the Regional Trial Court in Malolos, Bulacan and before this Court. Evidently, it was a product of an afterthought on the part of Mauricio Manliclic so that he could explain why he should not be held responsible for the incident. His attempt to veer away from the truth was also apparent when it would be considered that in his statement given to the Philippine Rabbit Investigator CV Cabading (Exh. 15), he alleged that the Philippine Rabbit Bus bumped the jeep of Calaunan while the Philippine Rabbit Bus was behind the said jeep. In his testimony before the Regional Trial Court in Malolos, Bulacan as well as in this Court, he alleged that the Philippine Rabbit Bus was already on the left side of the jeep when the collision took place. For this inconsistency between his statement and testimony, his explanation regarding the manner of how the collision between the jeep and the bus took place should be taken with caution. It might be true that in the statement of Oscar Buan given to the Philippine Rabbit Investigator CV Cabading, it was mentioned by the former that the jeep of plaintiff was in the act of overtaking another jeep when the collision between the latter jeep and the Philippine Rabbit Bus took place. But the fact, however, that his statement was given on July 15, 1988, one day after Mauricio Manliclic gave his statement should not escape attention. The one-day difference between the giving of the two statements would be significant enough to entertain the possibility of Oscar Buan having received legal advise before giving his statement. Apart from that, as between his statement and the statement of Manliclic himself, the statement of the latter should prevail. Besides, in his Affidavit of March 10, 1989, (Exh. 14), the unreliability of the statement of Oscar Buan (Exh. 13) given to CV Cabading rear its \u201cugly head\u201d when he did not mention in said affidavit that the jeep of Calaunan was trying to overtake another jeep when the collision between the jeep in question and the Philippine Rabbit bus took place.\n\nx x x x\n\nIf one would believe the testimony of the defendant, Mauricio Manliclic, and his conductor, Oscar Buan, that the Philippine Rabbit Bus was already somewhat parallel to the jeep when the collision took place, the point of collision on the jeep should have been somewhat on the left side thereof rather than on its rear. Furthermore, the jeep should have fallen on the road itself rather than having been forced off the road. Useless, likewise to emphasize that the Philippine Rabbit was running very fast as testified to by Ramos which was not controverted by the defendants. [40] Having ruled that it was petitioner Manliclic\u2019s negligence that caused the smash up, there arises the juris tantum presumption that the employer is negligent, rebuttable only by proof of observance of the diligence of a good father of a family. [41] Under Article 2180 [42] of the New Civil Code, when an injury is caused by the negligence of the employee, there instantly arises a presumption of law that there was negligence on the part of the master or employer either in the selection of the servant or employee, or in supervision over him after selection or both. The liability of the employer under Article 2180 is direct and immediate; it is not conditioned upon prior recourse against the negligent employee and a prior showing of the insolvency of such employee. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the private respondents to prove that they exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of their employee. [43]\n\nIn the case at bar, petitioner PRBLI maintains that it had shown that it exercised the required diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees, particularly petitioner Manliclic. In the matter of selection, it showed the screening process that petitioner Manliclic underwent before he became a regular driver. As to the exercise of due diligence in the supervision of its employees, it argues that presence of ready investigators (Ganiban and Cabading) is sufficient proof that it exercised the required due diligence in the supervision of its employees.\n\nIn the selection of prospective employees, employers are required to examine them as to their qualifications, experience and service records. In the supervision of employees, the employer must formulate standard operating procedures, monitor their implementation and impose disciplinary measures for the breach thereof. To fend off vicarious liability, employers must submit concrete proof, including documentary evidence, that they complied with everything that was incumbent on them. [44]\n\nIn Metro Manila Transit Corporation v. Court of Appeals , [45] it was explained that:\nDue diligence in the supervision of employees on the other hand, includes the formulation of suitable rules and regulations for the guidance of employees and the issuance of proper instructions intended for the protection of the public and persons with whom the employer has relations through his or its employees and the imposition of necessary disciplinary measures upon employees in case of breach or as may be warranted to ensure the performance of acts indispensable to the business of and beneficial to their employer. To this, we add that actual implementation and monitoring of consistent compliance with said rules should be the constant concern of the employer, acting through dependable supervisors who should regularly report on their supervisory functions.\n\nIn order that the defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision of employees may be deemed sufficient and plausible, it is not enough to emptily invoke the existence of said company guidelines and policies on hiring and supervision. As the negligence of the employee gives rise to the presumption of negligence on the part of the employer, the latter has the burden of proving that it has been diligent not only in the selection of employees but also in the actual supervision of their work. The mere allegation of the existence of hiring procedures and supervisory policies, without anything more, is decidedly not sufficient to overcome such presumption.\n\nWe emphatically reiterate our holding, as a warning to all employers, that \u201cthe formulation of various company policies on safety without showing that they were being complied with is not sufficient to exempt petitioner from liability arising from negligence of its employees. It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that in recruiting and employing the erring driver the recruitment procedures and company policies on efficiency and safety were followed.\u201d x x x. The trial court found that petitioner PRBLI exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection but not in the supervision of its employees. It expounded as follows:\nFrom the evidence of the defendants, it seems that the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines has a very good procedure of recruiting its driver as well as in the maintenance of its vehicles. There is no evidence though that it is as good in the supervision of its personnel. There has been no iota of evidence introduced by it that there are rules promulgated by the bus company regarding the safe operation of its vehicle and in the way its driver should manage and operate the vehicles assigned to them. There is no showing that somebody in the bus company has been employed to oversee how its driver should behave while operating their vehicles without courting incidents similar to the herein case. In regard to supervision, it is not difficult to observe that the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. has been negligent as an employer and it should be made responsible for the acts of its employees, particularly the driver involved in this case. We agree. The presence of ready investigators after the occurrence of the accident is not enough to exempt petitioner PRBLI from liability arising from the negligence of petitioner Manliclic. Same does not comply with the guidelines set forth in the cases above-mentioned. The presence of the investigators after the accident is not enough supervision. Regular supervision of employees, that is, prior to any accident, should have been shown and established. This, petitioner failed to do. The lack of supervision can further be seen by the fact that there is only one set of manual containing the rules and regulations for all the drivers of PRBLI. [46] How then can all the drivers of petitioner PRBLI know and be continually informed of the rules and regulations when only one manual is being lent to all the drivers?\n\nFor failure to adduce proof that it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its employees, petitioner PRBLI is held solidarily responsible for the damages caused by petitioner Manliclic\u2019s negligence.\n\nWe now go to the award of damages. The trial court correctly awarded the amount of P40,838.00 as actual damages representing the amount paid by respondent for the towing and repair of his jeep. [47] As regards the awards for moral and exemplary damages, same, under the circumstances, must be modified. The P100,000.00 awarded by the trial court as moral damages must be reduced to P50,000.00. [48] Exemplary damages are imposed by way of example or correction for the public good. [49] The amount awarded by the trial court must, likewise, be lowered to P50,000.00. [50] The award of P15,000.00 for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of litigation is in order and authorized by law. [51]\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition for review is DENIED . The decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 55909 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that (1) the award of moral damages shall be reduced to P50,000.00; and (2) the award of exemplary damages shall be lowered to P50,000.00.

VILLANUEVA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. AMADO B. DELORIA, RESPONDENT.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nROGELIO H. VILLANUEVA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. AMADO B. DELORIA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis treats of the Complaint [1] for Disbarment dated February 17, 1999 filed by Rogelio H. Villanueva (Villanueva) against Atty. Amado B. Deloria in connection with HLRB Case No. REM-080592-5166, entitled \u201cSpouses Conrado De Gracia v. Estate of Jaime Gonzales, et al.\u201d Atty. Deloria, a former full-time Commissioner of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), appeared as counsel for the spouses De Gracia.\n\nVillanueva avers that a decision in that case was rendered by Housing and Land Use Arbiter, [2] Atty. Teresita R. Alferez, requiring the Estate of Jaime Gonzales to, among other things, refund to the spouses De Gracia the amount of P69,000.00 plus interest at the prevailing commercial interest rates.\u00a0 The case was eventually assigned to Villanueva upon the latter\u2019s designation as Arbiter.\n\nIt appears that Atty. Deloria filed a Motion for Issuance of Substitute Judgment and for Consignation [3] claiming that the Estate of Jaime Gonzales does not want to pay interest based on commercial interest rates.\u00a0 Villanueva asserts, however, that Atty. Deloria\u2019s allegation is belied by two motions filed by counsel for the Estate of Jaime Gonzales which merely seek to clarify the precise interest rate applicable to the case in order for it to fully comply with the decision.\n\nAtty. Deloria\u2019s misrepresentation is allegedly a violation of the Code \u00a0of \u00a0Professional \u00a0Responsibility \u00a0(Code), particularly Canons 1, [4]\n\n10, [5] 12 [6] and 19 [7] thereof, the Attorney\u2019s Oath of Office and Art. 19 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Atty. Deloria also allegedly violated Canon 11 [8] of the Code because he sought the substitution of a decision which he knew had already become final and partially executed.\n\nVillanueva notes that Atty. Deloria enclosed with his motion a check in the amount of P69,000.00 payable to the order of the Estate of Jaime Gonzales and Corazon Gonzales, representing the principal refunded to the spouses De Gracia in compliance with the decision.\u00a0 Villanueva states that the check was drawn against Atty. Deloria\u2019s personal checking account in violation of Canon 16 [9] of the Code.\n\nMoreover, according to Villanueva, Atty. Deloria offered him 50% of the recoverable amount in the case if he resolves the latter\u2019s motion favorably. [10] Atty. Deloria\u2019s conduct allegedly violates the previously cited canons of the Code, Canon 13, [11] Rule 15.06, [12] Canon 15 of the Code, Art. 212 of the Revised Penal Code, the Attorney\u2019s Oath of Office and Art. 19 of the Civil Code.\n\nVillanueva also alleges that Atty. Deloria used his influence as former Commissioner of the HLURB to persuade Atty. Alferez to impose interest based on commercial rates instead of the interest rate fixed in Resolution No. R-421 [13] and Memorandum Circular No. 19, [14] both of which provide a uniform rate of interest in decisions involving refunds. Atty. Deloria also allegedly used his connections in the HLURB to prevent Villanueva from releasing an Order denying the former\u2019s motion and to prevail upon the agency\u2019s Legal Services Group to interpret the term \u201ccommercial rate of interest\u201d in a way that is favorable to his client\u2019s case, again in violation of the Code. [15]\n\nFurther, Villanueva claims that Atty. Deloria assisted his client in filing an unfounded criminal case against him before the Office of the Ombudsman with the purpose of getting even with Villanueva for denying their motion.\u00a0 When his client pursued this course of action, Atty. Deloria allegedly should have withdrawn his services in accordance with Rule 22.01, [16] Canon 22 of the Code.\n\nIn his Comment [17] dated September 22, 2000, Atty. Deloria denies any wrongdoing and sought the dismissal of the Complaint for lack of merit.\u00a0 He avers that the refusal of the Estate of Jaime Gonzales to pay the interest stipulated in the decision is evident from the various motions it has filed.\u00a0 On the alleged commingling of his funds with those of his clients\u2019, Atty. Deloria claims that the spouses De Gracia requested him to advance the amount intended for consignation as they were then on vacation in the United States.\u00a0 He also maintains that he did not exert any influence on the HLURB to rule in his clients\u2019 favor, adding that the draft order which he filed in the case is required under the rules of the agency.\n\nAtty. Deloria counters that it is Villanueva who has exhibited partiality in favor of the Estate of Jaime Gonzales by failing to rule on the motions for clarification filed by the latter, thereby forcing the spouses De Gracia to wait for an inordinately long time for the decision in their favor to be fully implemented.\n\nVillanueva, in his Reply [18] dated November 10, 2000, contends that he would have been indicted by the Office of the Ombudsman if it were true that his Order in the case was motivated by bias and partiality in favor of the Estate of Jaime Gonzales.\n\nIn a Resolution [19] dated February 19, 2001, we referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nInvestigating Commissioner Renato G. Cunanan submitted a Report [20] dated September 29, 2005, finding merit in the Complaint and recommending that Atty. Deloria be suspended from the practice of law for two (2) years and/or be fined in the amount of P20,000.00.\u00a0 This recommendation was annulled and set aside by the IBP in its Resolution No. XVII-2006-279 dated May 26, 2006.\u00a0 The case was instead dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nThe report and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner appears to be based solely on the Rollo of the case which the Court sent to the IBP pursuant to the Resolution dated February 19, 2001.\u00a0 The Investigating Commissioner did not conduct any hearing to determine the veracity of the allegations in Villanueva\u2019s Complaint and the truthfulness of Atty. Deloria\u2019s answers thereto.\n\nA formal investigation is a mandatory requirement which may not be dispensed with except for valid and compelling reasons. [21] In Baldomar v. Paras , [22] we held:\nComplaints against lawyers for misconduct are normally addressed to the Court. If, at the outset, the Court finds a complaint to be clearly wanting in merit, it outrightly dismisses the case. If, however, the Court deems it necessary that further inquiry should be made, such as when the matter could not be resolved by merely evaluating the pleadings submitted, a referral is made to the IBP for a formal investigation of the case during which the parties are accorded an opportunity to be heard. An ex-parte investigation may only be conducted when respondent fails to appear despite reasonable notice. x x x Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court provides the procedure for investigation in disbarment and disciplinary proceedings against attorneys before the IBP, thus:\nSec. 8. Investigation .\u2014Upon joinder of issues or upon failure of the respondent to answer, the Investigator shall, with deliberate speed, proceed with the investigation of the case. He shall have the power to issue subpoenas and administer oaths. The respondent shall be given full opportunity to defend himself, to present witnesses on his behalf, and be heard by himself and counsel. However, if upon reasonable notice, the respondent fails to appear, the investigation shall proceed ex-parte .\n\nThe Investigator shall terminate the investigation within three (3) months from the date of its commencement, unless extended for good cause by the Board of Governors upon prior application.\n\nWillful failure or refusal to obey a subpoena or any other lawful order issued by the Investigator shall be dealt with as for indirect contempt of court. The corresponding charge shall be filed by the Investigator before the IBP Board of Governors which shall require the alleged contemnor to show cause within ten (10) days from notice. The IBP Board of Governors may thereafter conduct hearings, if necessary, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Rule for hearings before the Investigator. Such hearing shall as far as practicable be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its commencement. Thereafter, the IBP Baord of Governors shall within a like period of fifteen (15) days issue a resolution setting forth its findings and recommendations, which shall forthwith be transmitted to the Supreme Court for final action and if warranted, the imposition of penalty. We find that due observance of the foregoing rules is necessary for the proper resolution of this case.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant administrative case is REMANDED to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for further proceedings.\u00a0 The IBP is also directed to act on this referral with deliberate dispatch.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio-Morales, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , Vol. 1, pp. 1-38.\n\n[2] Now HLURB Commissioner.\n\n[3] Rollo, Vol. 1, pp. 47-49.\n\n[4] CANON 1\u2014A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW AND LEGAL PROCESSES.\n\nRule 1.01\u2014A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.\n\n[5] CANON 10\u2014A LAWYER OWES CANDOR, FAIRNESS AND GOOD FAITH TO THE COURT.\n\nRule 10.01\u2014A lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice.\nRule 10.02\u2014A lawyer shall not knowingly misquote or misrepresent the contents of a paper, the language or the argument of opposing counsel, or the text of a decision or authority, or knowingly cite as law a provision already rendered inoperative by repeal or amendment, or assert as a fact that which has not been proved.\n\n[6] CANON 12\u2014A LAWYER SHALL EXERT EVERY EFFORT AND CONSIDER IT HIS DUTY TO ASSIST IN THE SPEEDY AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.\n\n[7] CANON 19\u2014A LAWYER SHALL REPRESENT HIS CLIENT WITH ZEAL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW.\n\n[8] CANON 11\u2014A LAWYER SHALL OBSERVE AND MAINTAIN THE RESPECT DUE TO THE COURTS AND TO JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND SHOULD INSIST ON SIMILAR CONDUCT BY OTHERS.\n\n[9] CANON 16\u2014A LAWYER SHALL HOLD IN TRUST ALL MONEYS AND PROPERTIES OF HIS CLIENT THAT MAY COME INTO HIS POSSESSION.\n\nRule 16.01\u2014A lawyer shall account for all money or property collected or received for or from the client.\n\n[10] Rollo , Vol. 1, p. 13.\n\n[11] CANON 13\u2014A LAWYER SHALL RELY UPON THE MERITS OF HIS CAUSE AND REFRAIN FROM ANY IMPROPRIETY WHICH TENDS TO INFLUENCE OR GIVES THE APPEARANCE OF INFLUENCING THE COURT.\n\n[12] Rule 15.06\u2014A lawyer shall not state or imply that he is able to influence any public official, tribunal or legislative body.\n\n[13] Rollo , p. 71.\n\n[14] Id. at 60.\n\n[15] Id. at 17-21.\n\n[16] Rule 22.01\u2014A lawyer may withdraw his services in any of the following cases:\n\na) When the client pursues an illegal or immoral course of conduct in connection with the matter he is handling;\nb) When the client insists that the lawyer pursue conduct violative of these canons and rules;\nc) When his inability to work with co-counsel will not promote the best interest of the client;\nd) When the mental or physical condition of the lawyer renders it difficult for him to carry out the employment effectively;\ne) When the client deliberately fails to pay the fees for the services or fails to comply with the retainer agreement;\nf)\u00a0 When the lawyer is elected or appointed to public office; and\ng) Other similar cases.\n\n[17] Rollo , \u00a0Vol. 1, pp. 177-190.\n\n[18] Id. at 195-203.\n\n[19] Id. at 233.\n\n[20] Rollo , Vol. 2, pp. 245-255.\n\n[21] Tabang v.

ABROGAR, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF REGIONAL TRIAL COURT BRANCH 150, MAKATI, AND INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK, RESPONDENTS D E C I S I O N\nJIMMY T. GO A.K.A., JAIME T. GAISANO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. ZEUS C. ABROGAR, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF REGIONAL TRIAL COURT BRANCH 150, MAKATI, AND INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAZCUNA, J.:\n\nThis is an appeal by petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from a decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\nPetitioner Jimmy T. Go raises the issue of whether or not his Notice of Appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court\u00a0 (RTC) should be given due course despite having been filed late.\n\nThe facts are not in dispute.\n\nOn March 31, 1998, respondent International Exchange Bank (Bank) filed a Complaint before the RTC of Makati [1] for Collection of a Sum of Money against petitioner and Alberto T. Looyuko, docketed as Civil Case No. 98-791. The complaint alleged that the Bank opened a credit line in favor of Looyuko to which petitioner executed a Surety Agreement binding himself solidarily for all debts incurred under the credit line. On various occasions, the defendants availed of the credit line to the total amount of P98,000,000, as evidenced by eight (8) promissory notes co-signed by both defendants. When the debts became due, the Bank demanded that the defendants settle their obligations. The defendants, however, failed to pay, prompting the Bank to institute the case against them. [2]\n\nPetitioner, at the start of the proceedings and until the case was submitted for decision, was represented by counsel, Atty. Ronald E. Javier. On October 7, 1999, the RTC rendered a decision, finding petitioner and Looyuko jointly and severally liable to the Bank for the amount of P96,000,000, plus interests and costs. [3] The decision was received by Atty. Javier, as counsel of record for petitioner, on October 20, 1999. Prior to this receipt, however, the relationship had apparently turned sour for counsel and client. On September 30, 1999, Atty. Javier wrote to petitioner, informing the latter that he was withdrawing his services as counsel. Petitioner, however, formally released Atty. Javier only on October 29, 1999 through a Notice of Termination [4] attached as Annex \"A\" to the \"Entry of Appearance,\" filed with the RTC on November 5, 1999 by petitioner's new counsel, Atty. Gregorio D. Caneda, Jr.\n\nOn November 5, 1999, petitioner, now represented by Atty. Caneda, Jr., filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the October 7, 1999 decision. [5] When the RTC denied the motion, [6] petitioner through his new lawyer filed a Notice of Appeal [7] on November 5, 1999. On February 8, 2000, the RTC issued an Order [8] denying the Notice of Appeal on the ground that the reglementary period had already expired on November 4, 1999, or one day before petitioner filed his Notice of Appeal, considering that the Registry Return Card showed that Atty. Ronald Javier received a copy of the decision on October 20, 1999.\u00a0 The decision having become final and executory, upon motion by the Bank, the RTC ordered the issuance of a Writ of Execution against petitioner. [9]\n\nOn March 6, 2000, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals to assail the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration and the Notice of Appeal and the granting of the issuance of a Writ of Execution. [10] Petitioner claims that he should not be bound by the receipt of the decision by Atty. Javier who was no longer his counsel when the latter received the decision.\n\nOn May 15, 2000, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision that denied the petition for lack of merit. [11] The appellate court held that the reglementary period to file the appeal began to run when Atty. Javier, who was still counsel of record as far as the RTC was concerned, received a copy of the decision on October 20, 1999, giving petitioner until November 4, 1999 within which to file his appeal or motion for reconsideration. It ruled that petitioner filed his Motion for Reconsideration a day after the period to file had lapsed, so that he had already lost his right to appeal from the decision.\n\nPetitioner is now before this Court on a Petition for Review by Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to reverse the denial of his Petition for Certiorari by the Court of Appeals. Petitioner argues that he should be given a new trial as his former counsel, Atty. Javier, was grossly negligent in the handling of his case and that he has a meritorious defense.\n\nThe Court finds the petition without merit. It should be noted that the assailed decision was decided by the Court of Appeals under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. To be granted relief under a special civil action, it must be convincingly proven that the court a quo committed grave abuse of discretion, or an act constituting a patent and gross evasion of a duty, or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, or that the trial court exercised its powers in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and personal hostility. [12] Bearing this standard in mind, the Court finds no error in the denial of the petition by the Court of Appeals as there was no showing that the RTC had gravely abused its discretion or whimsically exercised its judgment. The Court agrees with the RTC and the Court of Appeals that the decision was properly mailed to Atty. Javier as he was still counsel of record. His receipt of the decision on October 20, 1999 is, therefore, the starting point from which to count the 15-day reglementary period. The RTC, therefore, correctly dismissed the Notice of Appeal that was filed late.\n\nMoreover, under Section 26 of Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, an attorney may withdraw his representation by written consent of his client filed in court. Otherwise, notice and hearing on the withdrawal are necessary. Therefore, even if Atty. Javier had already written a letter to petitioner withdrawing his services as counsel, it did not become effective until after the submission by petitioner of the letter officially terminating Atty. Javier's services on October 29, 1999. In fact, petitioner even stated in the letter that his termination of Atty. Javier's services was effective only beginning October 29, 1999. [13] This constitutes an admission by petitioner that when Atty. Javier received the decision, he was still considered by petitioner as his counsel.\n\nPetitioner also argues that he should not be bound by the acts of Atty. Javier whom he claimed was grossly negligent in the handling of his case, even to the extent of calling him incompetent or that his actions were intentionally done. This argument has already been discredited as Atty. Javier was absolved of all negligence in connection with the case by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), after conducting an investigation upon a complaint filed by petitioner himself. [14] The IBP furnished this Court a copy of the resolution dismissing the complaint which the Court noted in a Resolution dated May 8, 2002 and thereafter the Court declared the case closed and terminated. Considering that petitioner's contention is that he should not be made to suffer the consequences of his counsel's negligence, his argument has no leg to stand on since Atty. Javier was declared not negligent in the first place.\n\nEven on the merits, the Court finds no substantial reason to reverse the RTC's decision finding petitioner liable solidarily with Looyuko to the Bank. There was no denying that he had signed the promissory notes as a co-maker and that he executed a Surety Agreement. Petitioner argues that the parties had actually intended their liabilities to be joint and that he has evidence to prove that his liability was less than what the RTC declared him liable for. Petitioner's liability is largely a factual assessment that has been thoroughly and extensively passed upon by the RTC and should not be disturbed on appeal. [15]\n\nBefore closing, the Court has a few observations regarding the conduct of petitioner and his counsel in this case. The petitioner alleges that:\nNow it can be told, that the fishy and suspicious actuations of Atty. Javier was done for the sole purpose of making sure that Jimmy T. Go will lose his case. With due respect, to our mind, it can even be said that the respondent IBank and its counsel Atty. Benedicto Valerio, Alberto Looyuko, petitioner's nemesis against whom he initiated several cases, and Looyuko's counsel Atty. Flaminiano, the Honorable Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 150 Zeuz Abrogar and Petitioner's negligent counsel Atty. Javier are in cahoots with one another in their common objective to pin down Mr. Jimmy T. Go. Our apprehension is not without basis, consider the following:\u00a0 x x x [16]\nPetitioner thereafter goes on to state the basis for his accusations against everyone connected to the case: [17] 1) Looyuko had withdrawn his appeal; 2) Atty. Flaminiano conformed to the writ of execution; 3) Atty. Javier neglected his case and continued to represent Looyuko in other cases; 4) Looyuko supported the Motion to Cite petitioner for contempt that was filed by the Bank; and, 5) Judge Abrogar was once an assistant fiscal under then Manila City Fiscal Atty. Flaminiano.\n\nPetitioner's particular attack against an RTC Judge is a serious accusation that erodes trust and confidence in our judicial system. This Court will not hesitate to sanction persons who recklessly and nonchalantly impute ill motives that are nothing more than unfounded speculations. The above \"suspicious\" circumstances enumerated, whether taken together or separately, are plainly unjustified as they fail to even remotely show the existence of a grand conspiracy against petitioner. For all their derogatory implication, they are clearly unsubstantiated and disrespectful to a member of the Bench.\n\nThe Court is also dismayed that such baseless attacks were assisted by counsel, who is an officer of the court. Under Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, A LAWYER SHALL OBSERVE AND MAINTAIN RESPECT DUE TO THE COURTS AND TO JUDICIAL OFFICERS. In particular, he shall not attribute to a judge motives not supported by the records or by evidence. A lawyer should submit grievances against a Judge to the proper authorities only. Atty. Caneda, Jr. should have known better than to permit the irresponsible and unsupported claim against Judge Abrogar to be included in the pleadings.\u00a0 Allowing such statements to be made is against a lawyer's oath of office and goes against the Code of Professional Responsibility. Petitioner Jimmy T. Go and Atty. Gregorio D. Caneda, Jr. are STRICTLY WARNED not to make disrespectful statements against a Judge without basis in the records or the evidence.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED . The decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 15, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 57572 is AFFIRMED.

THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, AND SPOUSES RUSTICO AND FE SANTOS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nVELASCO, JR., J.:\n\nChallenged in this Petition for Review on Certiorari is the June 25, 1996 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 32374, entitled Fernando Santiago v. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), et al. , which affirmed with modification the July 29, 1988 Decision of the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch XXVI in Civil Case No. R-81-616 for specific performance and damages against GSIS and for ejectment and damages against spouses Santos.\u00a0 Likewise assailed is the December 10, 1996 CA Resolution rejecting petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe Facts\n\nOn October 8, 1959, a Contract to Sell [1] was entered into by and between petitioner Fernando Santiago, with residence at 756 Padilla St., San Miguel, Manila and respondent GSIS over Lot 15, Block 2, Leonila Hills Subdivision, Baguio City, for a consideration of Thirty-three Thousand Pesos (PhP 33,000.00), subject to the following terms and conditions, viz:\n1. The PURCHASER agrees to pay the CORPORATION, upon signing this Agreement, the sum of (15% for Member and 25% for Non-Member) FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS ONLY (P4,950.00) Pesos, and the amount of THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN PESOS & 41/100 (P311.41) Pesos, Philippine Currency, monthly thereafter until the whole or full amount of the purchase price hereinabove stipulated has been fully paid to the entire and full satisfaction of the CORPORATION, with interest at the rate of Six Percent (6%) per annum or Eight percent (8%) for Non-Member, said interest to be payable monthly.\u00a0 Interest at the rate of 1% per month, payable monthly, will be charged by the CORPORATION on all payments delinquent for more than thirty (30) days.\n\nx x x x\n\n3. Possession of the building, the improvements thereon and the parcel of land hereinby contracted to be sold will be delivered to the PURCHASER by the CORPORATION, or its duly authorized representative, after the approval of the application by the Board of Trustees, the signing of this contract, and the payment of the down payment of (15% for Member) (25% for Non-Member) P4,950.00 in the office of the CORPORATION at Manila.\n\nx x x x\n\n7. No promises, verbal or written agreement, contracts or stipulations entered into by the PURCHASER with third parties, contrary to any of the contents of this agreement, shall in any way supersede, alter, modify or nullify this contract, nor shall they be valid unless authorized herein.\n\n8. Should the PURCHASER fail to pay any of the monthly installments herein provided within ninety (90) days of the date due, this contract shall be deemed automatically cancelled and forfeited, of no force and effect, and the CORPORATION shall have the complete, absolute, and boundless power, authority, jurisdiction and discretion, and without reservation by the PURCHASER, to dispose, sell, transfer, convey, assign and encumber the herein mentioned properties to any other person or persons, natural or juridical, in the same manner as if this contract or agreement has never been made, provided, however, that extension has been authorized expressly in writing by the CORPORATION or its duly authorized representative, may be allowed the PURCHASER upon proof of extra-ordinary misfortune satisfactory to the CORPORATION.\n\n9. In the event of the cancellation and forfeiture mentioned in the next preceding [sic] paragraph, all sums of money paid by or due from the PURCHASER under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this contract shall be considered as rental for the use of said property and the PURCHASER waives and forfeits rights to ask or demand the return thereof.\n\nx x x x\n\n15. Any single violation of this agreement shall be sufficient and adequate reason to consider the contract forfeited and the PURCHASER agrees to leave or vacate the property, leaving all improvements made [thereon] in good and serviceable condition, after notice in writing have been made on PURCHASER that he violated this agreement and PURCHASER failed or refused to rectify or correct said violation of the agreement.\n\nx x x x\n\n17. The PURCHASER shall not sell, cede, encumber, transfer in any manner [nor] assign his rights under this contract without the express consent of the CORPORATION in writing and until all the stipulations of this contract shall have been fulfilled faithfully as of the date of the transfer, assignment, conveyance or resale.\n\nx x x x\n\n19. The PURCHASER hereby agrees to respect and abide [by] all rules that may be promulgated by the CORPORATION or its management for the protection of the property rights of the CORPORATION, the PURCHASERS and/or residents of the project; and for the enforcement of said rules and regulations, the CORPORATION shall have the right to bring court action which may be proper in the premises. At the time petitioner Santiago signed the Contract to Sell, he was connected with the Law Division of the Department of Justice with office address at 756 Padilla St., San Miguel, Manila, the address he indicated in the contract.\u00a0 However, his home address was at 151 Cebu Avenue (now Mother Ignacia Avenue), Quezon City.\n\nIn 1963, petitioner became Chief of the Agrarian Counsel.\u00a0 In 1970, he was appointed Judge of the Court of First Instance of Quezon, Lucena City.\u00a0 He leased his Quezon City residence and he and his family resided in Lucena City.\n\nWith regard to the Baguio City property, petitioner took possession of it, undertook valuable improvements on the house, furnished it, and had it repainted twice.\n\nSometime in 1961, petitioner requested Mrs. Lydia B. Salonga, his first cousin and immediate neighbor in Quezon City, to take physical custody and care of the disputed property in Baguio City. \u00a0Mrs. Salonga is married to Sen. Jovito Salonga.\u00a0 The property is situated near the house and lot of Mr. Fernando Busuego, uncle of petitioner. [2]\n\nLikewise, petitioner asked Mrs. Salonga to lease or sell the property in order to at least recoup his investment. In summer of 1973, Dr. Jose De la Rosa, a resident of Baguio and a friend of the Busuegos, offered to rent the premises, in behalf of a certain American, Mr. Dennis Ireton. \u00a0Mrs. Salonga authorized Dr. De la Rosa to sell or lease the property to Ireton, who eventually became a tenant. [3]\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. De la Rosa negotiated with Mrs. Salonga for the eventual sale of the property to him. She apprised the petitioner of the developments. Thereafter, petitioner sent Mr. Agustin Ortega to the GSIS to verify the records.\n\nHowever, based on the GSIS records, petitioner failed to pay the agreed monthly amortizations of the subject property.\u00a0 Consequently, the GSIS Acquired Assets Department sent a September 9, 1968 demand letter to petitioner at his given address at 756 Padilla St., San Miguel, Manila based on the Contract to Sell; however, he failed to comply with the demand letter.\u00a0 Subsequently, the Acquired Assets Accounts Division of GSIS sent two (2) additional demand letters dated February 5, 1970 and December 7, 1972 to petitioner through registered mail at the same address.\n\nMeanwhile, the GSIS Claims Department sent two letters dated July 24, 1970 and November 16, 1970 to petitioner through mail at Lucena City regarding the refund to him of the insurance premiums he paid with interest. \u00a0While said department was informed of the office address of petitioner at the Court of First Instance of Quezon, Lucena City, the Acquired Assets Department was not aware of his new address which was why all communications relating to the Baguio lot were sent to his Manila address.\n\nSometime in October 1973, petitioner thought that he had already fully paid for the property and even exceeded his payments to GSIS.\u00a0 Thus, he sent a representative to the GSIS to ask the latter to execute a final deed of sale and to deliver the torrens title of the subject property to him, but he was apprised by his representative that his GSIS account was in arrears.\n\nOn October 29, 1973, Dr. Jose Dela Rosa wrote a letter to the GSIS informing the latter that he allegedly acquired the property of Senator Jovito Salonga at Leonila Hills, Baguio City, which the latter purchased from petitioner. He sent Fe Santos to find out the amount due to GSIS because of his desire to pay it in full so that he could have the title to the property transferred to him. [4] It appeared that Dr. De la Rosa allowed Fe Santos to rent petitioner\u2019s house and he offered to sell the lot to her. [5] Santos wanted to verify the papers with GSIS but in the process, she discovered that the owner of the subject property was petitioner Santiago and not De la Rosa.\u00a0 She also found out that petitioner was in arrears for 71 installments.\u00a0 A GSIS employee advised her to apply for the purchase of the property. Thus, on November 12, 1973, she filed an application with the GSIS to purchase the subject property. [6]\n\nWith regard to the rent of the premises, she tendered the payments of rentals to GSIS corresponding to two (2) months pending the processing of her application to purchase. [7] Through a November 23, 1973 letter, [8] GSIS then informed Santos to comply with its requirements in order to process her application; and she deposited PhP 622.82 to GSIS after complying with its requirements. [9]\n\nOn November 15, 1973, petitioner sent a letter to Mr. Cesar S. del Rosario, Accounting Chief of the Acquired Assets Accounts Division of the GSIS, stating that he was surprised to learn, through his representative, that he still had arrearages amounting to PhP 22,324.28 as of September 30, 1973. He reasoned that since he had already paid PhP 44,549.94, he concluded that the purchase price of PhP 33,000.00 was already fully paid. He also stated that he was informed that GSIS had sent letters or notices to his old address in San Miguel, Manila and not to the Court of First Instance of Quezon, Lucena City. Thus, he wanted to make arrangements with GSIS to settle his arrearages through his representatives, Agustin Ortega and Leopoldo Echevarria, Jr. [10]\n\nOn November 27, 1973, petitioner filed a letter of protest with Atty. Jaime Marcelo, Manager of the GSIS Acquired Assets Department. \u00a0He vehemently objected to any plan of awarding the property to any other person and manifested his willingness to pay whatever balance he may owe the GSIS. He also stated that Fe Santos and her family, who had been able to enter the premises without his knowledge or consent, may wish to leave the premises. [11]\n\nMeanwhile, on December 5, 1973, Fe Santos gave PhP 3,300.00 to GSIS in the nature of good faith deposit and PhP 100.00 processing fee. [12]\n\nOn December 6, 1973, petitioner sent a letter to Atty. Marcelo, which was hand carried by petitioner\u2019s representatives, Ortega and Echevarria, enclosing the check in the amount of PhP 17,024.71 as full payment of the alleged unpaid balance of the purchase price. [13] The letter and check were presented to the Manager of the Acquired Assets Department but these were transferred to his Assistant Manager for comment and recommendation. [14]\n\nIt was only on December 7, 1973 that GSIS sent a letter to petitioner at the Court of First Instance of Quezon, Lucena City notifying him of the cancellation of his award of the subject property effective October 25, 1973 for non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the Contract to Sell. [15] Specifically, he was in arrears for seventy-one (71) monthly amortizations as of September 30, 1973.\u00a0 Petitioner then sent a telegram of protest to the Manager of the Acquired Assets Department and requested reconsideration of the revocation of the award.\n\nOn December 12, 1973, the Assistant Manager of the Acquired Assets Department stated that \u201cJudge Santiago, [the former owner,] should be given preference per existing policy provided that the new purchase price is paid in full .\u201d He likewise averred that the new applicant, Fe Santos, had no perfected contract as her application was not yet approved by the Board and her payment would be subjected to refund under the GSIS\u2019 November 23, 1973 letter of proposal. [16]\n\nOn December 26, 1973, petitioner wrote a letter to GSIS to reconsider the cancellation of his award. [17] Then, on January 2, 1974, he repeated his request for reconsideration through a memorandum. [18] He argued that he failed to receive any notice of arrears or delinquency from the GSIS, notwithstanding the fact that it knew the address of his residence and all his changes of address and residence as a consequence of his promotions.\n\nOn February 12, 1974, Santos paid PhP 934.24 to the GSIS corresponding to the three (3)-month rental. [19]\n\nOn March 4, 1974, GSIS informed Santos that any improvements introduced to the lot or building, if any, were unauthorized, and the expenses that would be incurred were chargeable against her account. [20]\n\nOn June 11, 1974, Atty. Manuel Lazaro, Assistant General Manager of the GSIS Legal Affairs, recommended that the cancellation of the award of petitioner be set aside but with conditions that he would hold GSIS free and unharmed from any and all liability by reason of the cancellation, and to defend GSIS in any and all suits connected or related to the return of the money of Fe Santos. [21] On August 1, 1974, in its Board Resolution No. 21, the GSIS Board of Trustees approved the recommendation of Atty. Lazaro, with the conditions that were set forth in the meeting. [22]\n\nIn a letter dated August 31, 1974, Santiago accepted the terms and conditions of Board Resolution No. 21 provided however that \u201cthe full force and effect of the said original Deed of Conditional Sale x x x is recognized conformably with law x x x.\u201d [23] He later designated Leopoldo Echevarria as his attorney-in-fact, through a Special Power of Attorney, [24] to sign the Deed of Absolute Sale covering the property located at Leonila Hills, Baguio City.\n\nThrough a July 2, 1974 letter, GSIS notified Santos that her application to purchase the subject property was denied by its Board of Trustees and that GSIS was returning to her the amount of PhP 3,300.00 deposit she previously paid. [25] Moreover, through an August 15, 1974 letter, GSIS also informed Santos that it set aside the cancellation of the Contract to Sell in petitioner\u2019s favor. [26]\n\nOn September 16, 1974, petitioner sent a letter [27] to GSIS indicating his readiness to pay the balance he owed the latter, provided that he would not pay the interest charges and that the rental fees paid by Santos to the GSIS should be deducted from the total amount. \u00a0Thereafter, he paid the amount of PhP 17,230.78 to GSIS under protest. [28]\n\nOn December 12, 1974, petitioner, through Enrique Andres, sent a letter [29] to Santos demanding that she pay PhP 50,000.00 for damages for her continued illegal occupation of the premises, and asking her to immediately vacate them. [30]\n\nOn February 5, 1975, GSIS and petitioner executed a Deed of Absolute Sale. [31] Leopoldo Echevarria signed in favor of petitioner as his attorney-in-fact. However, petitioner asked GSIS to reform said deed to conform to the stipulations in the Contract to Sell because the deed contained onerous stipulations, but the latter rejected the demand. \u00a0The new conditions stated that:\n1. Within a period of five (5) years from and after the issuance of a Certificate of Title in favor of the VENDEE, the latter agrees and obligates not to assign, sell, lease, sublease, or otherwise encumber the above-described property or any portion thereof in favor of any party except in case of hereditary succession or resale in favor of the VENDOR. In case of breach thereof, the VENDEE obligates to pay liquidated damages in the amount of ?5,000.00 or to resell the property in favor of the VENDOR at the original price [at] which it was sold to the VENDEE, less the amount of ?5,000.00 by way of liquidated damages, at the option of the VENDOR.\n\nx x x x\n\n6. The VENDEE agrees to finally and unconditionally abide by the interpretation or construction of the VENDOR of any term, condition, or stipulation contained in this deed including its implementation. Should the VENDEE violate this provision or any provision contained in this Deed, VENDEE agrees, warrants and obligates to pay liquidated damages in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND (?5,000.00) PESOS. [32] On August 25, 1975, petitioner filed a Complaint [33] before the Manila RTC for specific performance to compel GSIS to execute a new Deed of Absolute Sale without any onerous conditions as petitioner alleged, to place him in peaceful possession of the premises, to refund to him the interest charges he paid to GSIS, to pay him the rentals paid by Fe Santos to GSIS, and for GSIS and Spouses Rustico and Fe Santos to pay damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nOn July 29, 1988, the trial court rendered its Decision in favor of petitioner, as follows:\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered DECLARING\u2013\n\n(1) \u00a0the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by and between the GSIS and plaintiff Fernando A. Santiago dated February 5, 1975 valid and enforceable as of the date of execution, February 5, 1975;\n\nand ORDERS the following:\n\n(2) The GSIS to refund to the plaintiff the interest it collected from the plaintiff for the months of December 6, 1973 to September 1974;\n\n(3) \u00a0The GSIS to deliver to the plaintiff all rentals it has received and paid by the defendants Rustico and Fe Santos;\n\n(4) The defendants Rustico Santos and Fe Santos to immediately vacate the premises, Lot No. 15, Block No. 2 with an area of four hundred ninety four (494) square meters, together with the building and improvements thereon and deliver the possession to the plaintiff;\n\n(5) \u00a0The defendants Rustico Santos and Fe Santos to pay the plaintiff the rentals for occupying the house and lot from November 1973 to and until they have vacated the premises, at the prevailing rate in the vicinity;\n\n(6) Defendants Rustico Santos and Fe Santos to pay the plaintiff the amount of P200,000.00 as moral damages and P200,000.00 as exemplary damages and P50,000.00 as attorney\u2019s fees;\n\n(7) \u00a0All improvements introduced by the defendants Rustico Santos and Fe Santos as builders in bad faith, to be forfeited in favor of the plaintiff; and\n\n(8) \u00a0Defendants Rustico Santos and Fe Santos to pay [the] costs of suit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [34] Unconvinced of the Decision, both petitioner Santiago and respondents Santos spouses appealed to the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 32374.\n\nOn June 25, 1996, the CA rendered its assailed Decision [35] affirming the July 29, 1988 Decision of the Manila RTC, but deleted the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe CA upheld the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by and between GSIS and petitioner on February 5, 1975, and ruled that the latter remains the absolute owner of the disputed property at Leonila Hills, Baguio City.\n\nWith respect to Fe Santos\u2019 application to buy the disputed property, the appellate court observed that said application was received by GSIS on November 12, 1973, when the Contract to Sell was already deemed automatically cancelled and of no force and effect pursuant to paragraph eight (8) of the contract; hence, GSIS acted in good faith. Likewise, it had no participation in placing Santos in possession of the disputed property, since it was Dr. dela Rosa who authorized her to occupy the house and lot. More importantly, the Santos application was denied by GSIS in 1974; thus, there was no perfected contract of sale between her and the GSIS, and she had no preferential or legal right over the property. Lastly, the CA held that spouses Santos should pay petitioner the fair rental value or the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the disputed property from November 1973 up to the time they vacate said property.\n\nThe CA however considered the award of moral or temperate, exemplary damages, and attorney\u2019s fee unwarranted because the trial court failed to state any factual basis for the award.\n\nAfter petitioner\u2019s plea for reconsideration was rejected in the December 10, 1996 CA Resolution, [36] he interposed the instant petition raising the following issues, viz:\nI\n\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling that respondent GSIS had acted in good faith is contrary to the documentary evidence and the established facts on record.\n\nII\n\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling that respondent Santos\u2019 possession of the property is in the concept of a lessee \u2013 is contrary to the evidence and this honorable court\u2019s affirmation of the finding of the court a quo.\n\nIII\n\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of the award of moral and exemplary damages is not in accord with the rulings of this Honorable Supreme Court. [37]\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nUnfortunately, the petition has to fail.\n\nFactual Matters Subject of Issues I and II Barred\n\nThe aforequoted grounds in petitioner\u2019s issues I and II raise factual issues which are precluded in this petition under the factual issue bar rule under Section 1, Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the petition shall raise only questions of law.\n\nUnder the first ground, petitioner claims GSIS acted in bad faith as shown by documentary evidence and the facts extant on the record.\u00a0 The query whether GSIS acted in bad faith is a question of fact as it will necessitate the examination of the probative value of the evidence adduced before the Manila RTC.\u00a0 The Court is not predisposed to render a review of such evidence as it is not a trier of facts.\n\nEven if we entertain the issue on whether GSIS acted in good faith in its dealings with petitioner, we agree with the CA that the GSIS acted aboveboard with regard to petitioner\u2019s contract.\u00a0 We uphold the ruling of the CA, thus:\nWe agree with the trial court that appellee GSIS acted in good faith in its transaction with the appellants regarding the properties in question.\n\nGood faith is defined as an honest intention to abstain from taking unconscientious advantage of another (Guzman Bocalinga v. Bonnevie, 206 SCRA 668).\u00a0 On the other hand, bad faith is a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive of self-interest or ill-will or for ulterior purpose (Air France v. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155).\n\nThe undeniable fact is that appellant Santiago was in arrears for 71 monthly amortizations as of September 1973.\u00a0 Under the provision of the Contract to Sell (Exhibit A) x x x, said contract was automatically cancelled on account of the long delay of appellant Santiago in settling those 71 amortizations.\u00a0 Appellant Santos filed her application to buy said properties on November 12, 1973 \u2013 at the time when the Contract to Sell was already deemed cancelled.\u00a0 Additionally, appellee GSIS had nothing to do with placing appellant Santos in possession of the properties in question.\u00a0 It was a certain Dr. Jose dela Rosa who put appellant Santos in possession of said properties as confirmed in his letter (Exhibit 17) dated November 10, 1973.\u00a0 Under these fully established facts, there is no way to label appellee GSIS as having acted in bad faith. [38] Under paragraph eight (8) of the Contract to Sell, GSIS had every right to cancel petitioner\u2019s contract for he was delinquent for five (5) years and eleven (11) months, and still, respondent GSIS was even generous enough to reinstate petitioner\u2019s contract.\u00a0 GSIS\u2019 act of restoring petitioner\u2019s contract is eloquent proof of its fairness to its members like petitioner and the absence of bad faith on its part.\n\nMoreover, GSIS entertained Santos\u2019 application to purchase the subject property only after petitioner Santiago committed the breach of the latter\u2019s contractual obligation to pay 71 monthly amortizations.\u00a0 Under the Contract to Sell, GSIS had the discretion to consider the contract automatically revoked even after a delinquency of only one monthly installment under paragraph eight (8) of the contract, but it did not.\u00a0 In this situation, GSIS had been more than liberal and accommodating to petitioner.\n\nIn addition, GSIS neither assisted nor placed Fe Santos in possession of the subject property.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, it was petitioner who indirectly authorized Santos to take possession of his lot by allowing Dr. Jose De la Rosa, through Mrs. Salonga, to manage the property by permitting Santos to use the lot as lessee. [39] This is the only plausible explanation for Santos\u2019 possession of the lot as there was no allegation that she committed acts of forcible entry on the lot.\u00a0 Thus, the act of petitioner in leasing the property through Dr. De la Rosa is a violation of paragraph 17 of the Contract to Sell, which prohibits him from selling or encumbering the property without GSIS\u2019 consent.\n\nFurthermore, Ortega and Echevarria, authorized representatives of petitioner, notified the Manager of the GSIS Acquired Assets Departments, through a December 12, 1973 letter, [40] that Fe Santos be allowed to be a sub-tenant by Dr. Jose De la Rosa, who, in turn, previously informed GSIS that he had purchased the subject property awarded to petitioner.\n\nGSIS was cautious in its dealings with Santos so as not to prejudice petitioner. It apprised Santos that her application to purchase was conditioned upon the approval of the GSIS Board of Trustees inclusive of its other terms and conditions.\u00a0 Eventually, her application was disapproved in 1974 after GSIS granted petitioner\u2019s request to reconsider its cancellation of his award.\n\nIt is hard to believe that GSIS acted in bad faith by colluding with Santos in depriving petitioner Santiago of the disputed lot.\u00a0 As a whole, we do not find the acts of GSIS dishonest or malicious to take an unconscionable advantage of petitioner.\n\nSimilarly, the second ground to support the instant petition likewise pertains to a factual issue\u2014whether the possession of respondents spouses Rustico and Fe Santos is in the nature of a lessee based on the evidence. Again, petitioner would like the Court to evaluate and calibrate the evidence anew\u2014a task already accomplished by the Manila RTC and later by the CA.\u00a0 We deny petitioner\u2019s request for it is not the Court\u2019s duty to analyze or weigh evidence all over again.\n\nAs a rule, the findings of fact of the CA are final and conclusive and cannot be reviewed on appeal by this Court. [41] More so, as in this case, when the findings of fact of the trial court were affirmed by the CA, the Court perforce must confirm and approve said findings.\u00a0 While every rule has its exceptions, petitioner has not satisfactorily shown that his appeal can lead to a departure from the aforementioned rule.\n\nEven if we consider the second issue as proper under Rule 45, still, the Court agrees with the CA that respondent Santos be treated as petitioner\u2019s lessee.\u00a0 This conclusion stems from the admission of petitioner himself in his RTC Complaint in Civil Case No. R-81-616, where he alleged:\n3. The [respondent] GSIS to refund the amount of interest charges paid by the herein plaintiff to the [respondent] GSIS for the period covering December 11, 1973 to September 30, 1974 and to deliver to the plaintiff the amount of monthly rentals collected by the [respondent] GSIS from the [respondent] Fe Santos; [42] Secondly, the December 12, 1973 letter of Ortega and Echevarria, [43] petitioner\u2019s authorized representatives, reveals without equivocation that respondent Fe Santos was allowed to be a sub-tenant of Dr. Jose Dela Rosa.\u00a0 Mr. Dela Rosa previously wrote to GSIS on October 29, 1973 that he had purchased the lot from petitioner. Thus, an implied lease was entered into between Santos and petitioner in view of the cancellation of Santos\u2019 GSIS application and her prolonged stay in said property.\n\nDeletion of damages sanctioned\n\nAnent the third issue, the Court rules that no reversible error was committed by the CA in recalling the award of moral and exemplary damages in petitioner\u2019s favor.\n\nIn awarding damages, it is settled principle that the trial court should state the factual bases of the award of these damages and attorney\u2019s fees. [44] A simple perusal of the July 29, 1988 Decision of the Manila RTC easily reveals the absence of any basis for the award of PhP 200,000.00 as moral damages and PhP 200,000.00 as exemplary damages in petitioner\u2019s favor.\u00a0 Such being the case, the CA is correct in disregarding said damages.\n\nIt is also a firm rule that while no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral damages may be awarded, the amount of indemnity being left to the discretion of the court, \u201cit is, nevertheless, essential that the claimant satisfactorily prove the existence of the factual basis of the damage and its causal relation to defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d [45]\n\nAs previously discussed, the Court has adopted the findings of fact of the CA, more particularly, its finding that spouses Santos are occupying the disputed lot as lessees.\u00a0 We agree with the CA that petitioner can recover only the fair rental value or the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the disputed property.\u00a0 The fact that the trial court awarded petitioner the rentals from respondents Santos spouses for the use of the house and lot from November 1973 until the latter vacates the premises necessarily precludes an additional award of damages.\u00a0 Hence, petitioner has not demonstrated ample justification for the reinstatement of moral damages.\n\nIn addition, Article 2234 of the Civil Code bars the award of exemplary damages since respondent spouses were not held liable for moral damages.\n\nFrom the foregoing considerations, petitioner has not shown that the CA deviated from applicable laws and pertinent Supreme Court rulings and hence, the Court rules that the CA has not committed any reversible error in its June 25, 1996 Decision and December 10, 1996 Resolution.\n\nWHEREFORE, we DENY the petition for lack of merit and AFFIRM the assailed CA Decision and Resolution, with no costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, and Tinga, concur.\nCarpio-Morales, J., no part, having concurred in the assailed decision.\n\n[1] Records, pp. 599-604.\n\n[2] Id. at 606.\n\n[3] Contract of Lease, id. at 715; Memorandum in Support of Judge Santiago\u2019s Request to Set Aside Notice of Cancellation, id. at 611-617, 612.\n\n[4] Id. at 690.\n\n[5] Id. at 621.\n\n[6] Id. at 691.\n\n[7] Id. at 512.\n\n[8] Id. at 592.\n\n[9] Id. at 692.\n\n[10] Id. at 495.\n\n[11] Id. at 497.\n\n[12] Id. at 693.\n\n[13] Id. at 10 & 498.\n\n[14] Id. at 503.\n\n[15] Id. at 499.\n\n[16] Id. at 503.\n\n[17] Id. at 550-555.\n\n[18] Id. at 382A-388.\n\n[19] Id. at 512.\n\n[20] Id. at 593.\n\n[21] Id. at 607-609.\n\n[22] Id. at 510-513.\n\n[23] Id. at 509.\n\n[24] Id. at 622-623.\n\n[25] Id. at 595.\n\n[26] Id. at 598.\n\n[27] Id. at 505-506.\n\n[28] Id. at 516-517.\n\n[29] Id. at 713.\n\n[30] Id. at 716.\n\n[31] Id. at 522-527.\n\n[32] Id. at 523-525.\n\n[33] Id. at 7-22.\n\n[34] CA rollo , pp. 146-147.\n\n[35] Rollo , pp. 41-49.

DATAR) AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis treats of the petition for review on certiorari assailing the Decision [1] and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 54035 entitled Presentacion D. Billones, et al. v. Felipa Delfin, et al., promulgated on 13 October 2000 and 26 December 2000, respectively, which reversed the 27 May 1996 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 15 of Roxas City.\n\nThe antecedents are as follows:\n\nOn 29 July 1960, a Deed of Absolute Sale [2] over Lot No. 213, covered by RO-5563 (14516) of the Cadastral Survey of Panitan, Capiz,\u00a0 was executed by Teresa Da\u00f1os, Esperanza Daradar, Estrella Daradar and Maria Daradar, with the marital consent of Cipriano Degala, husband of Teresa Da\u00f1os,\u00a0 in favor of the spouses\u00a0 Rodolfo Delfin and Felipa Belo (spouses Delfin).\u00a0 The document, so it appears, bore the signatures of Esperanza and Estrella, as well as the thumb marks of Teresa, Maria, and Cipriano, and was acknowledged before a notary public.\u00a0 On 18 November 1980, the spouses Delfin registered the Deed of Absolute Sale with the Register of Deeds of the Province of Capiz. Thereupon, a new title, Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-17071, was issued in the name of the spouses Delfin. [3]\n\nMeanwhile, on 26 March 1965, an Extra-Judicial Partition and Absolute Deed of Sale [4] involving Lot No. 3414 then covered by TCT No. T-16804 was made between Teresa Da\u00f1os, Trinidad Degala, Leopoldo\u00a0 Degala,\u00a0 Presentacion\u00a0 Degala,\u00a0 Rosario\u00a0 Degala\u00a0 and Pedro\n\nDegala, on one part, and the spouses Delfin, on the other.\u00a0 The deed, bearing either the thumb marks or the signatures of the sellers, was likewise notarized.\u00a0 Said document was registered by the spouses Delfin on 24 June 1980.\u00a0 Thus, TCT No. T-16804 covering Lot No. 3414 was cancelled and a new one, TCT No. T-16805, was issued in the names of the spouses Delfin on 24 June 1980. [5]\n\nThe spouses Delfin then consolidated Lots No. 213 and No. 3414 and subdivided the resulting lot into six (6) smaller lots. [6] Lot No. 1, covered by TCT No. T-19618, was sold to Roberto Delfin on 21 October 1989; Lot No. 2 covered by TCT No. T-19619 to Recio Da\u00f1os on 25 April 1985; Lot No. 3 covered by TCT No. T-19620 to Gina Maalat on 14 June 1989, and; Lot No. 4 covered by TCT No. T-19621 to Shirley Tamayo on 11 August 1989. Lot No. 5 remained with the spouses Delfin, while Lot No. 6 was used as an access road. [7]\n\nOn 12 April 1994, herein respondents, claiming to be the heirs of the former owners of Lots No. 213 and No. 3414, filed an action for annulment, reconveyance, recovery of ownership and possession and\u00a0 damages. [8] According\u00a0 to\u00a0 them,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was only in 1989 [9] when they\n\ndiscovered that Teresa Da\u00f1os, sick and in dire need of money, was constrained to mortgage the one-half (1/2) portion of Lot No. 3414 to the spouses Delfin for P300.00 sometime in 1965. [10] Taking advantage of her condition, the spouses Delfin made her sign a document purporting to be a mortgage, but which turned out to be an extrajudicial partition with deed of absolute sale. As to Lot No. 213, respondents averred that the Deed of Sale covering the property was fictitious and the signatures and thumb marks contained therein were all forged because three (3) of the signatories therein died before the alleged sale in 1960, namely: Estrella Daradar, who died in 1934, and Esperanza Daradar and Cipriano Degala, who both died in 1946. [11] As proof thereof, respondents presented certifications [12] on the deaths of Esperanza Daradar and Cipriano Degala by the Local Civil Registrar of Panitan, Capiz.\n\nTo counter respondents' arguments, petitioners alleged that respondents' action was already barred by prescription and laches.\u00a0 Further, they argued that the spouses Delfin, as well as the subsequent owners of the subject properties, are innocent purchasers for value and in good faith, whose titles to the lots at the time of the purchase were all\u00a0 clean\u00a0 and\u00a0 free\u00a0 from\u00a0 liens\u00a0 and\u00a0 encumbrances. [13] The documents evidencing the conveyance of the properties were personally and unilaterally executed by the vendors-signatories therein without any intervention from the spouses Delfin, and duly acknowledged before a notary public, petitioners averred. [14]\n\nGiving credence to the claims of petitioners, the trial court ruled that respondents' claim of ownership over the subject properties was not established by a preponderance of evidence.\u00a0 Compared to respondents' verbal claims of ownership, the spouses Delfin were able to prove that they bought the properties from the original owners, the trial court added.\u00a0 The trial court held that the deeds of sale being duly executed notarial and public documents, they enjoy the presumption of regularity which can only be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.\u00a0 In addition, respondents' claims based on fraud were barred by prescription, having been filed more than four (4) years from the time the instruments were registered with the Register of Deeds, and they are estopped from annulling the documents by reason of laches, the action having been filed 15 years after the deeds were registered.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court also denied respondents' claims for damages. [15]\n\nRespondents elevated the case to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the ruling of the trial court.\u00a0 In its Decision, [16] the Court of Appeals ruled that while an action for reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten (10) years from the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the property, such prescriptive period does not apply if the person claiming to be the owner of the property is in possession thereof, such as respondents in this case. [17] Moreover, considering that a similar action for reconveyance was filed by respondents as early as 1989 which was eventually dismissed without prejudice, respondents' action to annul the two (2) deeds on the ground of fraud has not yet prescribed, according to the Court of Appeals. [18]\n\nThe appellate court annulled the Extra-Judicial Partition and Deed of Sale covering Lot No. 3414. The appellate court noted that: (i) Teresa Da\u00f1os was a very old and sickly woman; (ii) she and her children lacked formal education to fully comprehend the document to which they affixed their signatures and/or thumb marks; (iii) P300.00 was inadequate consideration for a lot consisting of 1,565 square meters\u00a0 even in 1965; (iv) respondents were allowed to remain in the subject properties; and (v) the questioned document was registered in the name of the spouses Delfin 15 years after the alleged date of its execution, when most of the alleged vendors have already died.\u00a0 These circumstances surrounding the execution of the said document show that the real intention was merely to secure the loan of P300.00.\u00a0 Thus, what took place was in fact, an equitable mortgage and not a sale .[19]\n\nAs for Lot No. 213, the Court of Appeals held that the Deed of Absolute Sale could not have been executed on 9 July 1960. Relying on the certifications of death presented by respondents, the Court of Appeals ruled that the defense of due execution cannot prevail over the fact that two (2) of the signatories therein have already died prior to said date. [20] Roberto Delfin, Recio Da\u00f1os, Gina Maalat, and\u00a0 Shirley Tamayo, buyers of the subdivided lot, could not be considered as purchasers in good faith nor entitled to be protected in their rights because\u00a0 they were informed by respondents prior to the purchase that they, and not the spouses Delfin, are the real owners of the lots, the appellate court added. [21]\n\nThe Court of Appeals thus ruled:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the present appeal is hereby GRANTED.\u00a0 The Decision dated May 27, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court of Roxas City, Capiz, Branch 15 presided over by Judge Roger B. Patricio is hereby REVERSED and SET SIDE and a new one entered:\n\n(1) Annulling the Extra-Judicial Partition and Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 26, 1965 and Deed of Absolute Sale dated July 9, 1960;\n\n(2) Reinstating OCT No. RO-5563 (14516) referring to Lot 213 registered in the names of Teresa Da\u00f1os (1/2 portion), and the children of Lucia Da\u00f1os, namely: Esperanza Daradar, Estrella Daradar and Maria Daradar (1/2 pro-indiviso) and OCT No. (4650) RO-5529 referring to Lot 3414 registered in the names of the late\u00a0 spouses Cipriano Degala and Teresa Da\u00f1os, and canceling the TCTs issued thereafter;\n\n(3) Ordering plaintiffs-appellants, jointly and severally, to pay defendant Felipa Belo Delfin the amount of P300.00 within thirty (30) days from the date of finality of this decision;\n\n(4) Ordering defendants-appellees to free Lots 3414 and 213 from any and all obligations and encumbrances that may have been attached to both lots and thereafter to deliver possession of the same to plaintiffs-appellants; and\n\n(5) Ordering defendants-appellees, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiffs-appellants P10,000.00 as exemplary damages, and [sic] for attorney's fees and P10,000.00 as litigation expenses.\n\nCosts against defendants-appellees.\n\nSO ORDERED. [22]\nIn the present petition for review under Rule 45, petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that respondents retained possession of the subject properties. Moreover, petitioners posit that respondent's allegations of fraud and forgery confine their action to a four (4)-year prescriptive period which has long expired.\u00a0 Additionally, they argue that respondents failed to: (i) prove the inadequacy of the selling price of Lot No. 3414; (ii) prove the frail condition of Teresa Da\u00f1os; (iii) show that fraud attended the sale of Lot No. 213; (iv) show that Roberto Delfin, Recio Da\u00f1os, Gina Maalat and Shirley Tamayo are not purchasers in good faith; and (v) overcome the presumption of regularity enjoyed by the notarized deeds of sale.\u00a0 Petitioners also question the award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees in favor of respondents. [23] On the other hand, respondents for the most part merely reiterated the ruling of the Court of Appeals. [24]\n\nThe complete resolution of the issues presented before the Court requires a determination of facts, which this Court, not being a trier of facts, does not normally exercise in an appeal by certiorari. [25] This rule, however, is subject to exceptions, such as where the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are conflicting or contradictory, [26] as in the instant case.\n\nWhen one's property is registered in another's name without the former's consent, an implied trust is created by law in favor of the true owner. [27] Implied trusts are those which, without being expressed, are deducible from the nature of the transaction by operation of law as matters of equity, independently of the particular intention of the parties. Meanwhile, constructive trusts are created in order to satisfy the demands of justice and prevent unjust enrichment.\u00a0 They arise against one who, by fraud, duress or abuse of confidence, obtains or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, to hold. [28] An action for reconveyance based upon an implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten (10) years from the registration of the deed or from the issuance of the title, registration being constructive notice to all persons. [29] However, an action for reconveyance based on fraud is imprescriptible where the plaintiff is in possession of the property subject of the acts. [30]\n\nIn essence, petitioners insist that respondents failed to prove that fraud attended the sale of Lots No. 213 and No. 3414.\u00a0\u00a0 The Court agrees.\n\nA contract or conduct apparently honest and lawful must be treated as such until it is shown to be otherwise by either positive or circumstantial evidence. [31] A duly executed contract carries with it the presumption of validity.\u00a0 The party who impugns its regularity has the burden of proving its simulation. [32] A notarized document is executed to lend truth to the statements contained therein and to the authenticity of the signatures. Notarized documents enjoy the presumption of regularity which can be overturned only by clear and convincing evidence. [33]\n\nAs plaintiffs in the action before the trial court, respondents have the burden to establish their case by a preponderance of evidence, or evidence which is of greater weight or more convincing than that which is offered in opposition to it.\u00a0 Hence, parties who have the burden of proof must produce such quantum of evidence, with plaintiffs having to rely on the strength of their own evidence, not on the weakness of the defendant's. [34]\n\nAs regards Lot No. 3414, respondents specifically alleged that the spouses Delfin \"tricked the plaintiffs and their late mother into signing a fictitious and simulated document,\" and that \"TCT No. T-16805 was the product of a fictitious and simulated transaction [that] was obtained through fraud, the same should be declared null and void\". [35] They claimed that the original owners of Lot No. 3414 did not intend to execute a deed of extra-judicial partition and absolute sale but only a mortgage instrument.\u00a0 However, all that respondents came out with were bare\u00a0 allegations that the said owners were either old and sickly or illiterate; that the purported selling price of P300.00 was unconscionable; and that petitioners failed to eject respondents from the subject land, as respondents were unable to present any evidence to substantiate their claims, much less the\u00a0 charge of fraud.\n\nRespondents did not present any witness to testify on the execution of the deed, nor on the condition of the signatories thereto.\u00a0 At best, their witnesses merely testified as to the identity of the previous owners of the property. Worse, petitioners Presentacion Degala Billones and Rosario Degala Demonarca, both signatories to the subject deed, were not presented to testify on the real circumstances surrounding the assailed transaction.\u00a0 As for the selling price of P300.00, suffice it to say that respondents did not even present a witness to testify as to its alleged unconscionability vis-a-vis the prevailing market value of the property at the time of the sale.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, the belated registration of the document with the Register of Deeds can be explained by the fact that the original of OCT No.\u00a0 4650 covering Lot No. 3414 was either lost or destroyed and was reconstituted only in 1971, while the original copy of the deed of sale was lost by Felipa Delfin. [36]\n\nEven respondents' claim of possession of the subject properties has not been sufficiently proved.\u00a0 This Court has uniformly held that \"the one who is in actual possession of a piece of land claiming to be the owner thereof may wait until his possession is disturbed or his title is attacked before taking steps to vindicate his right.\u00a0 His undisturbed possession gives him a continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to ascertain and determine the nature of the adverse claim of a third party and its effect on his own title, which right can be claimed only by one who is in possession.\" [37] Actual possession of land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as those a party would naturally exercise over his own property. [38]\n\nContrary to the appellate court's illation, respondents have not established possession of the subject properties.\u00a0 Save for the lone testimony of\u00a0 Orlando Buday, a neighbor, that Rosario Degala Daradar was the only one still residing in the properties in dispute, no other evidence was presented to show that respondents are in actual occupation and possession\u00a0 thereof. Not even Rosario herself testified.\u00a0 Doubts also arise as to the veracity of respondents' claim of possession since respondents themselves averred in their complaint that the spouses Delfin had immediately taken possession of the subject properties in the same year that the sale was made, and appropriated the produce found in the subject lots from then on. [39] Admissions made in the complaint are judicial admissions which are binding on the party who made them and cannot be contradicted [40] absent any showing that it was made through palpable mistake. No amount of rationalization can offset such admission. [41] By their very own admissions, it can be inferred that respondents or their predecessors-in-interest did not exercise actual occupancy, as they had ceased to perform acts of dominion over the property upon the sale thereof.\n\nFraud may be, and often is, proved by or inferred from circumstances, and the circumstances proved may in some cases raise a presumption of its existence. However, while fraud may be proved by circumstances or presumed from them, it cannot be demonstrated by mere construction, but must be proven in all cases. [42] Respondents indeed failed to prove that fraud attended the execution of the Extra-Judicial Partition and Deed of Absolute Sale. Their bare and unsupported allegations are not enough to overthrow the presumption of the validity of said agreement or to raise the presumption of fraud.\n\nConsidering that respondents failed to establish the existence of fraud in the spouses Delfin's acquisition of Lot No. 3414, it cannot be said that implied or constructive trust was created between respondents and the spouses Delfin. The action for reconveyance of Lot No. 3414 must fail.\u00a0 Further, in view of respondents' failure to show their valid title to Lot No. 3414 or even their occupation thereof, the case cannot\u00a0 prosper even when it is viewed as one for quieting of title.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court of Appeals annulled the Deed of Absolute Sale dated 9 July 1960 covering Lot No. 213\u00a0 because \"one of the vendors therein was already dead,\" [43] relying on the certifications issued by the Local Civil Registrar.\u00a0 In assailing this declaration, petitioners once more point out that the Deed of Sale, being a duly notarized document, should be given full faith and credit.\u00a0 Also, they argue that the appellate court's conclusion is based on the disputable presumption that identity of names means identity of persons.\n\nDocuments consisting of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a public officer are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. [44] Public documents are (i) the written official acts, or records of the official acts of the sovereign authority, official bodies and tribunals, and public officers, whether of the Philippines, or of a foreign country; (ii) documents acknowledged before a notary public except last wills and testaments; and (iii) public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein. [45] Public documents may be proved by the original copy, an official publication thereof, or a certified true copy thereof; [46] and when a copy of a document or record is attested for the purpose of evidence, the attestation by the officer having legal custody of the record must state that the copy is a correct copy of the original, or a specific part thereof, as the case may be. [47] A duly-registered death certificate is considered a public document and the entries found therein are presumed correct, unless the party who contests its accuracy can produce positive evidence establishing otherwise. [48] Nevertheless, this presumption is disputable and is satisfactory only if uncontradicted, and may be overcome by other evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe documents presented by respondents were mere certifications and not the certified copies or duly authenticated reproductions of the purported death certificates of Esperanza Daradar\n\nand Cipriano Degala.\u00a0 They are not the public documents referred to by the Rules of Court, nor even records of public documents; thus, they do not enjoy the presumption granted by the Rules.\u00a0 Respondents did not even present the local civil registrar who supposedly issued the certifications to authenticate and identify the same. Likewise, respondent Jolly Datar who adverted to the certifications did not testify on how the certifications were obtained, much less his role therein. [49] As a consequence, the trial court did not admit the certifications as independent pieces of evidence but merely as part of the testimony of respondent Jolly Datar. [50] A document or writing which is admitted not as an independent evidence but merely as part of the testimony of a witness does not constitute proof of the facts related therein. [51] Clearly then, the certifications cannot be given probative value, and their contents cannot be deemed to constitute proof of the facts therein stated.\n\nMore importantly, the very exhibits of respondents dispel the presumption of regularity of the issuance of the certifications of death relied upon by the Court of Appeals. The certifications state that both Esperanza Daradar and Cipriano Degala died in 1946 at ages 24 and 63, respectively.\u00a0 However, a careful study of the records of the case shows that in OCT No. RO 5563 (14516), [52] Esperanza Daradar was already 20 years old in 1929, making her date of birth to be sometime in 1909.\u00a0 This is totally incongruous with her supposed age of 24 years in 1946, which places the year of her birth in 1922.\u00a0 Likewise, the Court takes note of the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 31739, [53] wherein the appellate court in its statement of facts found that Esperanza Daradar died on 10 August 1940, while Estrella Daradar died on 15 June 1943, contrary to the claim of respondents in this case. [54] The Esperanza Daradar named in the OCT and the one referred to in the aforesaid Decision could not have been the same Esperanza Daradar in the Local Civil Registrar's certification.\n\nAs for the Cipriano's thumb mark on the deed, suffice it to say that his consent was not in fact needed to perfect the sale.\u00a0 Teresa Da\u00f1os Degala's share in Lot 213 was paraphernal property and, under the provisions of the Civil Code applicable at the time of the sale, she could alienate or dispose of the said property without the permission or consent of her husband. [55] Thus, with or without such thumb mark, whether it was forged or not, the Deed of Absolute Sale remains valid and effectual.\n\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, respondents were unable to overthrow the presumption of validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale.\u00a0 Said deed, as well as the titles derived as a result thereof must be accorded respect and must remain undisturbed.\n\nAnent the charge of bad faith on the part of petitioners,\u00a0 the Court takes note of respondents' statement in their Plaintiff-Appellants' Brief, [56] to wit:\nFrom the facts and circumstances of this case, Lot 213 and 3414 both of Panitan Cadastre which were consolidated, into one single lot, per consolidated plan as appearing at the back of TCT No. T-17071, and after the two lots were consolidated, and the same was subdivided, into six smaller lots, Lots 1, 4 and 5 thereof still remained in the names of appellees spouses Rodolfo Delfin and Felipa Belo, while Lots 2 and 3 thereof were transferred by the said spouses appelle[es] to Recio Da\u00f1os and Gina Maalat, respectively.\u00a0 These two transferees are innocent purchasers for value which appellants admit, and this appeal is only an appeal by appellants against defendant-appellees spouses Rodolfo Delfin and Felipa Belo, and not against Recio Da\u00f1os and Gina Maalat. [57] (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn effect, contrary to the testimony of respondents' witness Myrna Degala-Distura that her mother warned petitioners against buying the subject lots, [58] respondents admitted that the only persons they consider to be not innocent purchasers are the spouses Delfin.\u00a0 However, in view of respondents' failure to prove the fraud attributed to the spouses Delfin, the Court has no choice but to declare all petitioners to be\u00a0 purchasers for value and in good faith.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.\u00a0 The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 13 October 2000\u00a0 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.\u00a0 The Decision of the Regional Trial Court dated 27 May 1996 is REINSTATED.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Acting Chairman), and Carpio Morales, JJ., concur.\nQuisumbing, J., on official leave\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Martin S.

NO. 146224, January 26, 2007 ]\n\nVIRGINIA REAL, PETITIONER, VS. SISENANDO H. BELO, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nVIRGINIA REAL, PETITIONER, VS. SISENANDO H. BELO, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court assailing the Resolution [1] dated June 16, 2000 of the Court of Appeals (CA) which dismissed outright the petition for review of Virginia Real (petitioner) in CA-G.R. SP No. 58799, and the CA Resolution [2] dated November 27, 2000 which denied her Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe facts of the case:\n\nPetitioner owned and operated the Wasabe Fastfood stall located at the Food Center of the Philippine Women\u2019s University (PWU) along Taft Avenue, Malate, Manila. Sisenando H. Belo (respondent) owned and operated the BS Masters fastfood stall, also located at the Food Center of PWU.\n\nAround 7:00 o\u2019clock in the morning of January 25, 1996, a fire broke out at petitioner\u2019s Wasabe Fastfood stall. The fire spread and gutted other fastfood stalls in the area, including respondent\u2019s stall. An investigation on the cause of the fire by Fire Investigator SFO1 Arnel C. Pinca (Pinca) revealed that the fire broke out due to the leaking fumes coming from the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) stove and tank installed at petitioner\u2019s stall. For the loss of his fastfood stall due to the fire, respondent demanded compensation from petitioner. However, petitioner refused to accede to respondent\u2019s demand.\n\nHence, respondent filed a complaint for damages against petitioner before the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 24, Manila (MeTC), docketed as Civil Case No. 152822. [3] Respondent alleged that petitioner failed to exercise due diligence in the upkeep and maintenance of her cooking equipments, as well as the selection and supervision of her employees; that petitioner\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the fire that gutted the fastfood stalls. [4]\n\nIn her Answer dated September 23, 1996, petitioner denied liability on the grounds that the fire was a fortuitous event and that she exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of her employees. [5]\n\nAfter trial, the MeTC rendered its Decision [6] dated April 5, 1999 in favor of the respondent, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant ordering the latter:\n\n1) To pay the plaintiff the sum of P50,000.00 representing temperate or moderate damages; and\n\n2) To pay the plaintiff the sum of P25,000.00 as and for attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses.\n\nThe counterclaim filed by the defendant is hereby DENIED FOR LACK OF MERIT.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7] The MeTC held that the investigation conducted by the appropriate authority revealed that the fire broke out due to the leaking fumes coming from the LPG stove and tank installed at petitioner\u2019s fastfood stall; that factual circumstances did not show any sign of interference by any force of nature to infer that the fire occurred due to fortuitous event; that the petitioner failed to exercise due diligence, precaution, and vigilance in the conduct of her business, particularly, in maintaining the safety of her cooking equipment as well as in the selection and supervision of her employees; that even if petitioner passes the fault to her employees, Article 2180 of the Civil Code finds application; that in the absence of supporting evidence, the amount of actual damages and unrealized profits prayed for by respondent cannot be granted; that, nonetheless, respondent is entitled to temperate damages since respondent sustained pecuniary loss, though its true value cannot, from the very nature of the case, be proved with certainty.\n\nDissatisfied, petitioner filed an appeal with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 43, Manila (RTC), docketed as Civil Case No. 99-94606, insisting that the fire was a fortuitous event. On November 26, 1999, the RTC affirmed the Decision of the MeTC but increased the amount of temperate damages awarded to the respondent from P50,000.00 to P80,000.00. [8]\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration contending that the increase in the award of temperate damages is unreasonable since she also incurred losses from the fire.\n\nIn its Order dated April 12, 2000, the RTC denied petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration holding that it cannot disregard evidence showing that the fire originated from petitioner\u2019s fastfood stall; that the increased amount of temperate damages awarded to respondent is not a full compensation but only a fair approximate of what he lost due to the negligence of petitioner\u2019s workers. [9]\n\nPetitioner then filed a Petition for Review with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 58799. [10] On June 16, 2000, the CA issued a Resolution dismissing the petition for being \u201cprocedurally flawed/deficient.\u201d [11] The CA held that the attached RTC Decision was not certified as a true copy by the Clerk of Court; that a certified true copy of the MeTC Decision was not attached; that material portions of the record, such as the position papers of the parties and affidavits of witnesses, as would support the material allegations of the petition were also not attached. [12]\n\nOn July 14, 2000, petitioner filed her Motion for Reconsideration, [13] attaching photocopies of the Decisions of the RTC and MeTC as certified correct by the Clerk of Court. [14]\n\nOn November 27, 2000, the CA issued its Resolution denying petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration. [15]\n\nHence, the present petition raising the following issues:\nWhether the submitted certified true copy of the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court as authenticated by a court employee other than the Clerk of Court who was not around at that time said copy was secured constitutes compliance with the Rules?\n\nWhether the submission of a certified true copy of the Metropolitan Trial Court\u2019s judgment is still an indispensable requirement in filing a petition for review before the Court of Appeals despite the fact that said judgment was already modified by the above decision of the Regional Trial Court and it is the latter decision that is the proper subject of the petition for review?\n\nWhether the submission of copies of the respective position papers of the contending parties is still an indispensable requirement in filing a petition for review before the Court of Appeals despite the fact that the contents thereof are already quoted in the body of the verified petition and in the subject judgment of the Metropolitan Trial Court?\n\nWhether the herein petitioner could be held liable for damages as a result of the fire that razed not only her own food kiosk but also the adjacent foodstalls at the Food Center premises of the Philippine Women\u2019s University, including that of the respondent?\n\nWhether the Regional Trial Court could increase the amount of damages awarded by the Metropolitan Trial Court in favor of the respondent who has not even filed an appeal therefrom? [16] Petitioner submits that rules of procedure should not be applied in a very harsh, inflexible and technically unreasonable sense.\n\nWhile admitting that the RTC Decision and Order were not certified by the Clerk of Court himself, petitioner insists that they were certified as authentic copies by Administrative Officer IV Gregorio B. Paraon of the RTC.\n\nAs to the MeTC Decision, petitioner contends that the submission of a certified true copy thereof is not an indispensable requirement because that judgment is not the subject of the petition for review.\n\nIn any case, petitioner submits that she had substantially complied with the requirements of the rule when she attached with her Motion for Reconsideration the copies of the Decisions of the RTC and MeTC as certified correct by the Clerk of Court.\n\nAnent the non-submission of the position papers of the parties, petitioner maintains that the contents of said position papers were lengthily quoted verbatim in the petition and in the attached copy of the MeTC Decision.\n\nOn the submission of affidavits of witnesses, petitioner contends that it was not necessary because the case before the MeTC was not covered by summary proceedings.\n\nOn the merits of her petition before the CA, petitioner avers that she should not be held liable for a fire which was a fortuitous event since the fire could not be foreseen and the spread of the fire to the adjacent fastfood stalls was inevitable.\n\nLastly, she argues that the RTC cannot increase the amount of temperate damages since the respondent did not appeal from the judgment of the MeTC.\n\nRespondent opted not to file a Comment, manifesting that the petition contains no new arguments which would require a comment since the arguments are but a rehash of those raised and decided by the lower courts. [17]\n\nThe Court gave due course to the petition and required both parties to submit their respective memoranda. [18] In compliance therewith, petitioner submitted her Memorandum. [19] On the other hand, respondent filed a Manifestation stating that since no new issues have been raised by the petitioner in her petition and in order not to be redundant, he adopts as his memorandum the memoranda he filed in the MeTC and the RTC. [20]\n\nIn his Memoranda before the MeTC and RTC, respondent emphasized the evidence he presented to establish his cause of action against petitioner, principally the testimony of Fire Investigator SFO1 Arnel G. Pinca stating that the fire originated from the LPG stove and tank in petitioner\u2019s fastfood stall.\n\nThe requirements as to form and content of a petition for review of a decision of the RTC are laid down in Section 2 of Rule 42 of the Revised Rules of Court, thus:\nSec. 2. Form and contents . - The petition shall be filed in seven (7) legible copies, with the original copy intended for the court being indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall (a) state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the lower courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or respondents; (b) indicate the specific material dates showing that it was filed on time; (c) set forth concisely a statement of the matters involved, the issues raised, the specification of errors of fact or law, or both, allegedly committed by the Regional Trial Court, and the reasons or arguments relied upon for the allowance of the appeal; (d) be accompanied by clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court, the requisite number of plain copies thereof and of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nx x x x Under Section 3 of the same Rule, failure to comply with the above requirements \u201cshall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof.\u201d\n\nHowever, Section 6, Rule 1 of the Revised Rules of Court also provides that rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding. Indeed, rules of procedure should be used to promote, not frustrate justice. [21]\n\nIn the present case, petitioner\u2019s submission of copies of the RTC Decision and Order certified as correct by the Administrative Officer IV of the RTC is insufficient compliance with the requirements of the rule. Petitioner failed to show that the Clerk of Court was officially on leave and the Administrative Officer was officially designated as officer-in-charge. The rule is explicit in its mandate that the legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts must be certified correct by the Clerk of Court.\n\nNonetheless, a strict application of the rule in this case is not called for. This Court has ruled against the dismissal of appeals based solely on technicalities in several cases, especially when the appellant had substantially complied with the formal requirements. [22] There is ample jurisprudence holding that the subsequent and substantial compliance of a party may call for the relaxation of the rules of procedure. [23] When the CA dismisses a petition outright and the petitioner files a motion for the reconsideration of such dismissal, appending thereto the requisite pleadings, documents or order/resolution, this would constitute substantial compliance with the Revised Rules of Court. [24]\n\nThus, in the present case, there was substantial compliance when petitioner attached in her Motion for Reconsideration a photocopy of the Decision of the RTC as certified correct by the Clerk of Court of the RTC. In like manner, there was substantial compliance when petitioner attached, in her Motion for Reconsideration, a photocopy of the Decision of the MeTC as certified correct by the Clerk of Court of the RTC.\n\nOn the necessity of attaching position papers and affidavits of witnesses, Section 2 of Rule 42 of the Revised Rules of Court requires attachments if these would support the allegations of the petition. [25] In the present case, there was no compelling need to attach the position papers of the parties since the Decisions of the MeTC and RTC already stated their respective arguments. As to the affidavits, the Court notes that they were presented by the respondent as part of the testimony of his witness Fire Investigator Pinca and therefore would not support the allegations of the petitioner.\n\nTruly, in dismissing the petition for review, the CA had committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in putting a premium on technicalities at the expense of a just resolution of the case.\n\nThe Court\u2019s pronouncement in Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals [26] is worth echoing: \u201ccases should be determined on the merits, after full opportunity to all parties for ventilation of their causes and defenses, rather than on technicality or some procedural imperfections. In that way, the ends of justice would be better served.\u201d [27] Thus, what should guide judicial action is that a party litigant is given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his action or defense rather than for him to lose life, honor or property on mere technicalities. [28]\n\nThe next most logical step would then be for the Court to simply set aside the challenged resolutions, remand the case to the CA and direct the latter to resolve on the merits of the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 58799. But, that would further delay the case. Considering the issues raised which can be resolved on the basis of the pleadings and documents filed, and the fact that petitioner herself has asked the Court to decide her petition on the merits, the Court deems it more practical and in the greater interest of justice not to remand the case to the CA but, instead, to resolve the controversy once and for all. [29]\n\nThe Court shall now address the issue of whether the fire was a fortuitous event.\n\nJurisprudence defines the elements of a \u201cfortuitous event\u201d as follows: (a) the cause of the unforeseen and unexpected occurrence must be independent of human will; (b) it must be impossible to foresee the event which constitutes the caso fortuito , or if it can be foreseen, it must be impossible to avoid; (c) the occurrence must be such as to render it impossible for the debtor to fulfill his obligation in a normal manner; and (d) the obligor must be free from any participation in the aggravation of the injury resulting to the creditor. [30]\n\nArticle 1174 of the Civil Code provides that no person shall be responsible for a fortuitous event which could not be foreseen, or which, though foreseen, was inevitable. In other words, there must be an entire exclusion of human agency from the cause of injury or loss. [31]\n\nIt is established by evidence that the fire originated from leaking fumes from the LPG stove and tank installed at petitioner\u2019s fastfood stall and her employees failed to prevent the fire from spreading and destroying the other fastfood stalls, including respondent\u2019s fastfood stall. Such circumstances do not support petitioner\u2019s theory of fortuitous event.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s bare allegation is far from sufficient proof for the Court to rule in her favor. It is basic in the rule of evidence that bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof. [32] In short, mere allegations are not evidence. [33]\n\nThe Civil Code provides:\nArt. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. x x x\n\nArt. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages caused by their employees in the service of the branches in which the latter are employed or on the occasion of their functions.\n\nEmployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage. Whenever an employee\u2019s negligence causes damage or injury to another, there instantly arises a presumption juris tantum that the employer failed to exercise diligentissimi patris families in the selection ( culpa in eligiendo ) or supervision ( culpa in vigilando ) of its employees. [34] To avoid liability for a quasi-delict committed by his employee, an employer must overcome the presumption by presenting convincing proof that he exercised the care and diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of his employee. [35]\n\nIn this case, petitioner not only failed to show that she submitted proof that the LPG stove and tank in her fastfood stall were maintained in good condition and periodically checked for defects but she also failed to submit proof that she exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of her employees. For failing to prove care and diligence in the maintenance of her cooking equipment and in the selection and supervision of her employees, the necessary inference was that petitioner had been negligent. [36]\n\nAs to the award of temperate damages, the increase in the amount thereof by the RTC is improper. The RTC could no longer examine the amounts awarded by the MeTC since respondent did not appeal from the Decision of the MeTC. [37] It is well-settled that a party who does not appeal from the decision may not obtain any affirmative relief from the appellate court other than what he has obtained from the lower court, if any, whose decision is brought up on appeal. [38] While there are exceptions to this rule, such as if they involve (1) errors affecting the lower court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) plain errors not specified, and (3) clerical errors, [39] none apply here.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED . The assailed Resolutions dated June 16, 2000 and November 27, 2000 of the Court of Appeals are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated November 26, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 43, Manila is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the temperate damages awarded is reduced from P80,000.00 to P50,000.00 as awarded by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 24, Manila in its Decision dated April 5, 1999.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Renato C.

SP No. 50234. [1]\n\nPetitioner and private respondents are the contending parties in two separate civil cases before the lower courts. Civil Case No. 3452-F-96 is for Sum of Money, Damages and Attorney's Fees pending before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Davao City, Branch 6, where petitioner is the plaintiff while private respondent Atty. Serafin Osabel (Atty. Osabel) and Alfredo Rubin (Rubin) are the defendants. On the other hand, Civil Case No. 25,086-97 is for Damages and Attorney's Fees with Prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Davao City, Branch 8, with private respondents as plaintiffs and petitioner as defendant.\n\nIn Civil Case No. 3452-F-96, petitioner alleged in its Amended Complaint that: it entered into an electric service contract with Rubin; despite notice, Rubin failed to pay his electric bills from September 1990 to May 1993 until it amounted to P35,154.17, prompting petitioner to cut off electrical service on October 14, 1993; petitioner discovered that during said period, Rubin's electricity service was extended beyond his property line to a certain Ronald Donguila, who, in turn, sold his property to Atty. Osabel; petitioner also discovered that Atty. Osabel was using the electrical service of a certain Maria Mercedes Villarosa (Villarosa); petitioner tried to collect from Atty. Osabel but the latter refused and instead, informed petitioner that he is consigning the payment of his current consumption to the court; petitioner tried to collect the amount consigned to the court but was informed by the Clerk of Court that he needed an order to do so; petitioner gave Atty. Osabel an opportunity to settle his obligation under his present consumption but the latter ignored petitioner's communications; because of private respondents' failure to pay the arrears, petitioner disconnected the service on February 6, 1997, and in view of the termination of the contract, removed the meter from the premises. [2] Thus, petitioner prayed for the payment of the sums sought to be collected, damages and attorney's fees. [3]\n\nMeanwhile, in Civil Case No. 25,086-97, Atty. Osabel, together with his co-private respondents wife and children, presented three causes of action for damages due to petitioner's (1) failure to give notices of disconnection in two instances between February 1996 and December 1996; (2) disconnection of private respondents' electric services on February 6, 1997; and (3) removal of the electric meter by petitioner in full view of their neighbors and the public on February 21, 1997. [4]\n\nPrivate respondents alleged in their complaint that: in 1994 and with petitioner's knowledge, they leased a residential house owned by Villarosa including the use of Electric Meter No. 86817 under Account No. 091-13848; some time in December 1995, they received from petitioner a letter demanding payment of P18,900.17 for the electrical consumption made under the name of Rubin; Atty. Osabel replied and informed petitioner that his obligation under Account No. 091-13848 has been settled, and the demand for payment for the consumption made in Rubin's name is illegal for which he cannot be held liable, and that he is tendering payment in the amount of P189.41 as full payment for his March 1996 account; petitioner wrote back to Atty. Osabel, informing him that the unpaid account in Rubin's name was transferred to his name under Account No. 091-13848, and that a conference was scheduled on May 22, 1996 so that the matter may be settled; Atty. Osabel declined to attend the conference, reiterated his objection to the transfer of Rubin's account to his name, and requested for a statement of account for May 1996 so that he could deposit the amount with the Office of the Clerk of Court of the MTCC; several communications were exchanged between petitioner and Atty. Osabel until the electrical service to the Osabels was twice disconnected, in February and December 1996, without notice and warning; Atty. Osabel made deposits with the MTCC Office of the Clerk of Court for their account due from March 1996 to December 1996; on January 1997, petitioner wrote Villarosa claiming the amount of P9,633.32 as outstanding balance as of January 1997, without prejudice to its recovery of the amount of P18,900.17 against Atty. Osabel; Atty. Osabel then made another deposit of P1,008.44 with the MTCC Office of the Clerk of Court for their January 1997 consumption, notifying petitioner of the same in a Notice of Consignation dated February 3, 1997; petitioner refused to acknowledge the consignation and decided to terminate its service contract on February 6, 1997, and removed its electric meter on February 21, 1997. [5] In each of the three causes of action, the Osabels prayed for the award of moral, nominal and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees and litigation expenses in their favor. They also prayed for the deletion of the amount of P9,633.32 from Account No. 091-13848. [6]\n\nPetitioner filed an Amended Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. 25,086-97 on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, lack of cause of action, and that a valid consignation needs a judicial action in the MTC for the complaint to prosper. [7] With regard to lack of jurisdiction, petitioner argued that the claim for moral damages is only for P80,000.00, and as such, it is below the jurisdictional amount cognizable by the RTC. Petitioner also argued that since private respondents' other causes of action pertain to their consignation of P7,912.62 before the MTCC, and the damages prayed for are mere incidents to it, then the RTC has no jurisdiction over the case. On the issue of the lack of cause of action, petitioner contended that private respondents, who alleged that the case is one for damages and not consignation, failed to allege in their complaint that there was a valid consignation made in order for them to validly claim the damages sought. Petitioner also contended that private respondents are not even the real-party-in-interest inasmuch as they are mere lessees of Villarosa and the contract of service was with the latter. Finally, petitioner claimed that the consignation made with the clerk of court is ineffective in the absence of a complaint or case made in court. [8]\n\nPrivate respondents filed their opposition to the amended motion to dismiss, refuting petitioner's arguments. Respondents essentially claimed that the case before the trial court is for damages and does not depend on the issue of consignation. [9]\n\nOn June 19, 1997, the RTC issued its Order denying the motion to dismiss. The RTC ruled thus:\nIn this regard, this Court notes that the instant claim is for the recovery of damages for the alleged and oppressive act of defendant in cutting of power in plaintiffs' abode which this Court finds to be incapable of pecuniary estimation for as stated in Raymundo vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 213 SCRA 457, \"(I)n determining whether an action is one the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation this Court has adopted the criterion of first ascertaining the nature of the principal action or remedy sought. If it is primarily for the recovery of a sum of money, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary estimation, and whether it is in the municipal court [now municipal trial courts] or in the courts of first instance [now regional trial courts] would depend on the amount of the claim. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, or where the money claim is purely incidental to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought, this Court has considered such action as cases where the subject of litigation may not be estimated in terms of money, and are cognizable exclusively by courts of first instance [now regional trial courts].\"\n\nAnent the second, defendant asserts that the complaint fails to state a cause of action upon plaintiffs' failure to allege a valid consignation, which, it stresses, is a matter upon which their claim is hinged.\n\nThis Court appreciates the logic of defendant's arguments. The argument, however, assumes that plaintiffs' claim depend on a valid consignation or that the consignation made by plaintiffs was ineffective. Suffice it to state that these are matters better ventilated at the trial on the merits. [10] Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the RTC's denial, which was denied by the RTC in its Order dated November 10, 1998. [11]\n\nPetitioner then brought the RTC orders to the CA via petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction, but the CA denied this in the assailed Decision dated October 6, 2000. The decretal portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit; and the assailed Orders of the respondent Judge in Civil Case No. 25,086-97 are AFFIRMED en toto . The petitioner is hereby ordered to file its Answer before the court a quo.\n\nSO ORDERED. [12] The CA found that the RTC has jurisdiction over the case inasmuch as the action before the RTC seeks to compel petitioner to accept payment of the consigned amounts, and therefore one for specific performance, which is incapable of pecuniary estimation. [13]\n\nPetitioner sought reconsideration of the CA's decision but this was denied by the CA in the assailed Resolution dated February 6, 2001. [14]\n\nHence, the present petition, with petitioners setting forth basically the same arguments it raised before the RTC and the CA. [15] According to petitioner, based on the allegations and the relief prayed for in the complaint, the action before the RTC is a consignation case or an action to compel the creditor to accept payment; and following the ruling in Ascue v. Court of Appeals, 196 SCRA 804, the amount consigned is below the jurisdiction of the RTC. Petitioner also argues that the case before the RTC is not a proper consignation case as it is not lodged with the proper forum where the consignation or deposit is at the disposal of judicial authority, the deposits having been made with the MTCC Office of the Clerk of Court. Lastly, petitioner contends that since it is not the proper case, then it is dismissible for lack of jurisdiction, lack of or failure to state a cause of action and litis pendentia .\n\nIt has long been settled that an order denying a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order. It neither terminates nor finally disposes of a case, as it leaves something to be done by the court before the case is finally decided on the merits, and as such, the general rule is that the denial of a motion to dismiss cannot be questioned in a special civil action for certiorari. [16] In order to justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, the denial of the motion to dismiss must have been tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. [17] In this case, the Court finds none.\n\nBoth the RTC and the CA found that Civil Case No. 25,086-97 is within the RTC's jurisdiction as the same is incapable of pecuniary estimation. But that is the only aspect where the two courts shared the same view. The RTC and the CA differed in characterizing respondents' case. It was the opinion of the RTC that Civil Case No. 25,086-97 is one for damages, while the appellate court found that it was for specific performance. Given this divergence of opinion, it now devolves upon the Court to ascertain the nature of the case before the RTC and ultimately determine whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the same.\n\nThe nature of an action is determined by the material averments in the complaint and the character of the relief sought. [18] In this case, the complaint filed in Civil Case No. 25,086-97 sufficiently established a case for DAMAGES, and not specific performance. Neither is it an action for consignation. This is evident from the reading of the allegations in the complaint and the reliefs prayed for. The complaint principally sought an award of moral, nominal and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, for the alleged damages suffered by respondents by reason of petitioner's disconnection of their electrical service. The allegations regarding the consignation with the court of the amounts due to petitioner are mere factual premises from which respondents are basing their theory that petitioner's disconnection of the electrical service and removal of the electric meter was unjustified. Also, the relief sought by respondents for the RTC to order petitioner to delete the amount of P9,633.32 from their account is merely incidental to their claim for damages. It is not the main cause of their claim.\n\nGiven that Civil Case No. 25,086-97 is an action for damages, the next question to be resolved is whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nRepublic Act No. 7691, which took effect on April 15, 1994, provides that where the amount of the demand in civil cases exceeds P100,000.00, exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs, the exclusive jurisdiction thereof is lodged with the RTC. [19] Where the amount of the demand in the complaint does not exceed P100,000.00, exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs, the exclusive jurisdiction over the same is vested in the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court and Municipal Circuit Trial Court. [20] On March 20, 1999, by virtue of Administrative Circular No. 21-99, the jurisdictional amount was increased to P200,000.00.\n\nGuidelines in the implementation of R.A. No. 7691 were laid out in Administrative Circular No. 09-94 dated June 14, 1994. Particularly, with regard to damages, paragraph 2 provides:\n2. The exclusion of the term \"damages of whatever kind\" in determining the jurisdictional amount under Section 19 (8) and Section 33 (1) of B.P. Blg. 129, as amended by R.A. No. 7691, applies to cases where the damages are merely incidental to or a consequence of the main cause of action. However, in cases where the claim for damages is the main cause of action, or one of the causes of action, the amount of such claim shall be considered in determining the jurisdiction of the court. (Emphasis supplied) Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint, irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover all or some of the claims or reliefs sought therein. [21] Jurisdiction should not be affected by the pleas or the theories set up by the defendant in an answer or a motion to dismiss. Otherwise, jurisdiction would become dependent almost entirely upon the whims of the defendant. [22]\n\nThe complaint in Civil Case No. 25,086-97 was filed on March 3,\n\n1997, [23] hence, R.A. No. 7691 and its implementing guidelines apply. In their prayer, respondents sought, among others, the following awards:\nx x x x\n\nC. On the First Cause of Action: To condemn defendant to pay plaintiffs the sum of P80,000.00 moral damages, P20,000.00 nominal damages and P20,000.00 exemplary or corrective damages with interest at the legal rate from the date of filing of the complaint until fully paid.\n\nD. On the Second Cause of Action: To condemn the defendant to pay damages to the following plaintiffs, viz.:\n(1) To plaintiff Serafin S. Osabel:\n\nP200,000.00 \u2014 moral damages\n20,000.00 \u2014 nominal damages\n20,000.00 \u2014 temperate damages\n20,000.00 \u2014 exemplary or corrective damages\nwith interest at the legal rate from the date of filing of the complaint until fully paid.\n(2) To plaintiffs Neoceda Osabel, Marie Johanna Osabel-Garcia, Victoria Luz-Dacuycuy, Anna Christia Osabel and Serafin Osabel, Jr.\n\nP150,000.00 \u2014 moral damages\n25,000.00 \u2014 nominal damages\n25,000.00 \u2014 exemplary or corrective damages\nwith interest at the legal rate from the date of filing of the complaint until fully paid.\n\n(3) P6,163.13 actual or compensatory damages with interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid.\n\nE. On the Third Cause of Action: To condemn the defendant to pay plaintiffs the sum of P140,000.00 in damages itemized as follows:\n\nP100,000.00 \u2014 moral damages\n20,000.00 \u2014 nominal damages\n20,000.00 \u2014 exemplary or corrective damages [24] It is clear from the foregoing that respondents' main action is for damages. Hence, all these claims must be included in determining the jurisdictional amount, and obviously, it falls within the jurisdiction of the RTC.\n\nPetitioner's argument of lack of cause of action likewise cannot stand.\n\nCause of action is defined as the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another. [25] A complaint is said to assert a sufficient cause of action if, admitting what appears solely on its face to be correct, the plaintiff would be entitled to the relief prayed for. Assuming the facts that are alleged to be true, the court should be able to render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer in the complaint. [26]\n\nThe rule is that in a motion to dismiss, a defendant hypothetically admits the truth of the material allegations of the plaintiff's complaint. This hypothetical admission extends to the relevant and material facts pleaded in, and the inferences fairly deducible from, the complaint. Hence, to determine whether the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the complaint constitutes a cause of action, the test is as follows: admitting the truth of the facts alleged, can the court render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer? [27]\n\nA perusal of the complaint discloses sufficient allegations of a legal right or interest enjoyed by respondents, which was allegedly violated by petitioner, thus causing damages and injury to the former. The issue of valid consignation raised by petitioner is a matter of defense that is best left to be established by proof and determined during the trial on the merits of the case, as was correctly ruled by the RTC.\n\nLastly, with regard to the ground of litis pendentia as a ground for dismissal of the case, suffice it to say that petitioner never raised this issue before the RTC or the CA. It is being alleged for the first time only before the Court. The rule is that questions not raised in the lower courts cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. [28] Consequently, the Court will not dwell on said issue.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED . The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Davao City, Branch 8, is ORDERED to proceed with Civil Case No. 25,086-97 with dispatch.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Andres B.

JACINTO, FRANCISCO YU & SHEOLIN YU, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.\n\nAssailed and sought to be set aside in this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is the Decision [1] dated May 30, 1997 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No.45054 , as reiterated in its Resolution [2] of March 15, 2000, affirming an earlier Order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 55, which dismissed, on ground of prescription, the complaint for a sum of money with prayer for a writ of attachment thereat commenced by the petitioner against the herein respondents.\n\nThe decision under review recites the factual backdrop as follows:\nOn August 19, 1981, defendant corporation [now respondent Diamond Seafoods Corporation], represented by Romeo V. Jacinto, and Francisco C. Yu, together with Sheolin M. Yu, as sureties, executed a continuing Surety Agreement in favor of the plaintiff [now petitioner] banking corporation, binding themselves, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiff all credit accommodations, including Trust Receipts and other credit facilities as may from time to time be incurred by the said defendant, together with their interests, charges and other miscellaneous costs. On December 3, 1982, defendant corporation, through defendant Romeo V. Jacinto, executed and signed Trust Receipt No. 63725 in the sum of P78,595.99 in favor of the plaintiff, obliging itself to hold in trust certain merchandise consisting of two cases of machinery for PBCom\u2019s account. The Trust Receipt provided, among other things, that the defendant corporation shall sell the said merchandise and turn over the proceeds thereof to PBCom on or before March 3, 1983. In case of failure to sell the same, defendant undertook to return the goods on or before the same date to the plaintiff. Again, On February 14, 1983, defendant corporation, through the defendant Romeo V. Jacinto, executed Trust Receipt No. L-17572 in the amount of P85,147.00 in favor of PBCom, with the undertaking that it will hold in trust certain merchandise consisting of one (1) lot of electrical fixtures for PBCom\u2019s account under the same obligation of selling much (sic) merchandise and to turn over the proceeds thereof to PBCom on or before May 15, 1983, if sold, or to return the goods to the plaintiff on or before the said date if unsold (See Annexes \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d, Complaint). Defendants defaulted to comply with any of the conditions of the aforesaid trust receipts such that as of June 15, 1983 the obligation stood at P327,844.03, minus corresponding marginal deposits which were deducted from the respective accounts. Despite demands made upon the defendant, no payment whatsoever was made on the account prompting the plaintiff to file a complaint against the defendants with the City Fiscal\u2019s Office of Manila for Violation of P.D. 115 which was dismissed on January 16, 1985 for failure to prosecute. Thus this civil complaint.\n\nThe defendant Romeo V. Jacinto filed an Answer with special and affirmative defenses, among them being that the action has already prescribed, and prayed for a hearing thereon. Such motion, and the Motion for Judgment on the Pleading, were heard on February 14, 1994 and were deemed submitted for resolution. (Words in brackets supplied.) In an Order [3] of February 18, 1994, the trial court, addressing the pending incidents before it, dismissed the petitioner\u2019s complaint on the ground of prescription. Explains the trial court in its order of dismissal:\nFrom the allegations of the complaint itself, it is rather clear that this action has long prescribed. The Trust Receipts involved here were dated December 3, 1982 and February 14, 1983 (See Annexes \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC,\u201d respectively). The obligation to pay and or return the goods reflected thereby became due on March 3, 1983 and May 15, 1983, per the Trust Receipts and the allegations of the complaint. The complaint was filed on July 27, 1993, or some ten (10) years and more than two (2) months after the maturity of the second trust receipt. Surely, the action has prescribed in accordance with Article 1144, par. 1, of the Civil Code, this action being based upon a written contract. The period of prescription was never interrupted from the moment the obligation became due and demandable. The filing of the complaint before the City Fiscal\u2019s Office of Manila for Violation of P.D. 115 against the defendants which resulted in its dismissal on January 16, 1985 did not arrest the running of prescriptive period. P.D. 115 is a special law punishing, among other things, the violation of trust receipts. As such, the prescriptive period for filing offenses covered thereby shall be interrupted only upon the filing of a case in court, and not otherwise (See Luz M. Zaldivia vs. Hon. Andres R. Reyes, Jr., etc. L-102342, July 3, 1992).\n\nPrescinding from that fact, however, even if we grant that the filing of the complaint with the City Fiscal\u2019s Office of Manila arrested the running of the prescriptive period, this case was nevertheless filed beyond the ten year period provided by law.\n\nWhile the other defendants did not raise the defense of prescription in their Answer, this Court may nevertheless dismiss this case on such ground as it appears very clearly from the very allegations of the complaint and the documents attached thereto that prescription has already set in ( See Ferrer vs. Ericta, et al., L-41767, Aug. 23, 1978).\n\nThe action having prescribed, no judgment on the pleading in favor of the plaintiff may be favorably made as the action has got to be dismissed. Therefrom, petitioner went on appeal to the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 45054 . As stated at the outset hereof, the appellate court, in the herein assailed Decision [4] of May 30, 1997, affirmed the appealed dismissal order of the court of origin saying, inter alia , thus:\nxxx. We find that appellant [now petitioner] incorrectly invoked Article 1155 of the New Civil Code . Indeed, anent the issue of prescription, what is clearly applicable is Act No. 3326. Section 2 of said Act, which runs counter to Article 1155 of the Civil Code invoked by appellant, provides that prescription is interrupted only when judicial proceedings are instituted against the guilty person and shall begin to run again if the proceedings are dismissed. It goes to show that the running of the prescriptive period shall be halted on the date the case is filed in court, and not on any date prior thereto.\n\nConsidering that the prescriptive period in the case at bar is ten (10) years (Article 1144 of the Civil Code) , and that the complaint below was filed on July 27, 1993, the cause of action of plaintiff-appellant has indeed long prescribed.\n\nIneluctably, We believe and so hold the trial court committed no reversible error in dismissing the complaint for recovery of a sum of money, on the ground of prescription. (Words in bracket supplied) Its motion for reconsideration of the aforementioned decision having been denied by the CA in its Resolution [5] of March 15, 2000, petitioner is now with this Court via the instant recourse on its singular submission that the two (2) courts below erred \u201cWHEN THEY [A] DISMISSED THE CIVIL COMPLAINT ON THE GROUND OF PRESCRIPTION BASED ON ACT NO. 3326 INSTEAD OF ARTICLE 1155 OF THE NEW CIVIL CODE; AND [B] COMPUTED THE PERIOD OF PRESCRIPTION CONTRARY TO WELL-SETTLED JURISPRUDENCE.\u201d\n\nThe petition is without merit.\n\nPetitioner invokes Article 1155 of the Civil Code which provides:\nART. 1155. The prescription of actions in interrupted when they are filed before the court, when there is a written extrajudicial demand by the creditors , and when there is any written acknowledgement of the debt by the debtor. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nPetitioner insists on the applicability of the aforequoted legal provision, particularly the underscored portion thereof, relying heavily on alleged demands it made upon the respondents, as stated in paragraph 8 of its complaint, to wit:\n\n8. Notwithstanding demands made by PBCom upon the defendants, the latter failed and refused to pay their long overdue obligations; [6]\n\nWhile the truth of the foregoing allegation is ordinarily hypothetically admitted in the resolution of the issue of prescription in a motion to dismiss, the petitioner itself prevented such hypothetical admission when it stated in paragraph 9 of the same complaint that:\n\n9. PBCom made several attempts to get in touch with the defendants to demand payment or settle their obligations but same proved futile for reasons beyond PBCom\u2019s control. [7] (Emphasis supplied.) There could have been no valid and effective demand made in this case considering that the demand letters were never received by the respondents. Petitioner reaffirmed such fact of non-receipt when it expressly stated in its Appeal Brief [8] before the CA that the demand letters it sent to the respondents on July 17, 1984 were never received by the latter, to wit:\nHowever, the plaintiff-appellant sent its demand letters on July 17, 1984, but despite several notices, defendants-appellees refused to claim the same. As a consequence thereof, some of the demand letters were returned to sender (PBCom) on August 23, 1984. [9] (Emphasis supplied.) There can be no other factual conclusion in this case, therefore, than that there was no valid and effective extra-judicial written demand, as required by Article 1155 of the Civil Code, supra , for the petitioner\u2019s claimed interruption of the running of the prescriptive period.\n\nPetitioner alternatively claims that the criminal complaint it lodged against the respondents before the City Fiscal\u2019s Office of Manila may be considered as an extra-judicial demand for purposes of Article 1155. There is, however, nothing on record which shows that the respondents were duly notified of the filing of such complaint before said office. Just like in the case of the aforementioned demand letters, the filing of the criminal complaint adverted to did not have the effect of a valid demand for purposes of Article 1155.\n\nBesides, petitioner itself admits that said criminal complaint was dismissed by the Fiscal\u2019s Office for failure to prosecute. Hence, no criminal action for alleged violation of the Trust Receipts Law was ever instituted in any court of law against the respondents upon which the civil aspect thereof may be said to have been deemed instituted.\n\nFrom the records of the case before the Court, therefore, there was nothing that interrupted the running of the ten-year prescriptive period from the time petitioner\u2019s cause of action accrued, with the non-payment of the civil obligations arising from the maturity of the subject trust receipts.\n\nWe disagree, however, with the ruling of the CA that the provisions of Act No. 3326, [10] as amended, instead of Article 1155, should apply. Act No. 3326, as amended, will apply only if what is in issue is the prescription of a criminal action for violation of special laws, like the Trust Receipts Law. The Act, which is a penal statute, finds no application in computing the period when a civil suit for breach of contract based on trust receipts, such as the instant case, prescribes. Petitioner is thus correct in citing Article 1155 as the pertinent law in this civil case.\n\nThe CA\u2019s error notwithstanding, the Court sustains the result of its affirmance of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint in this case because the instant civil action was indeed filed beyond the 10-year prescriptive period provided under Article 1144 [11] of the Civil Code, which had not been interrupted by any action filed in court, or any written extrajudicial demand as explained above, or any written acknowledgement of the debt by herein respondents as provided in Article 1155.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nCosts against the petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Guitierrez, Corona and Azcuna, JJ. concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Jainal D.

PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK, RESPONDENT \n D E C I S I O N\nSPOUSES VICENTE YU AND DEMETRIA LEE-YU, PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of the Decision [1] dated November 14, 2000 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 58982 and the CA Resolution dated April 26, 2001, which denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe factual background of the case is as follows:\n\nUnder a Real Estate Mortgage dated August 15, 1994 [2] and Amendments of Real Estate Mortgage dated April 4, 1995 [3] and December 4, 1995, [4] spouses Vicente Yu and Demetria Lee-Yu (petitioners) and spouses Ramon T. Yu and Virginia A. Tiu, or Yu Tian Hock aka Victorino/Vicente Yu, mortgaged their title, interest, and participation over several parcels of land located in Dagupan City and Quezon City, in favor of the Philippine Commercial International Bank (respondent) as security for the payment of a loan in the amount of P9,000,000.00. [5]\n\nAs the petitioners failed to pay the loan, the interest, and the penalties due thereon, respondent filed on July 21, 1998 with the Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan City a Petition for Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage on the Dagupan City properties. [6] On August 3, 1998, the City Sheriff issued a Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale scheduling the auction sale on September 10, 1998 at 10:00 o'clock in the morning or soon thereafter in front of the Justice Hall, Bonuan, Tondaligan, Dagupan City. [7]\n\nAt the auction sale on September 10, 1998, respondent emerged as the highest bidder. [8] On September 14, 1998, a Certificate of Sale was issued in favor of respondent. [9] On October 1, 1998, the sale was registered with the Registry of Deeds of Dagupan City.\n\nAbout two months before the expiration of the redemption period, or on August 20, 1999, respondent filed an Ex-Parte Petition for Writ of Possession before the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan City, docketed as Special Proceeding No. 99-00988-D and raffled to Branch 43 (RTC Branch 43). [10] Hearing was conducted on September 14, 1999 and respondent presented its evidence ex-parte. [11] The testimony of Rodante Manuel was admitted ex-parte and thereafter the petition was deemed submitted for resolution.\n\nOn September 30, 1999, petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Out Testimony of Rodante Manuel stating that the Certificate of Sale dated September 14, 1998 is void because respondent violated Article 2089 of the Civil Code on the indivisibility of the mortgaged by conducting two separate foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage properties in Dagupan City and Quezon City and indicating in the two notices of extra-judicial sale that petitioners' obligation is P10,437,015.20 [12] as of March 31, 1998, when petitioners are not indebted for the total amount of P20,874,031.56. [13]\n\nIn the meantime, petitioners filed a complaint for Annulment of Certificate of Sale before the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 99-03169-D and raffled to Branch 44 (RTC Branch 44).\n\nOn February 14, 2000, RTC Branch 43 denied petitioners' Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Out Testimony of Rodante Manuel, ruling that the filing of a motion to dismiss is not allowed in petitions for issuance of writ of possession under Section 7 of Act No. 3135. [14]\n\nOn February 24, 2000, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, further arguing that the pendency of Civil Case No. 99-03169-D in RTC Branch 44 is a prejudicial issue to Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D in RTC Branch 43, the resolution of which is determinative on the propriety of the issuance of a writ of possession. [15]\n\nOn May 8, 2000, RTC Branch 43 denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, holding that the principle of prejudicial question is not applicable because the case pending before RTC Branch 44 is also a civil case and not a criminal case. [16]\n\nOn June 1, 2000, petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA. [17] On November 14, 2000, the CA dismissed petitioners' Petition for Certiorari on the grounds that petitioners violated Section 8 of Act No. 3135 and disregarded the rule against multiplicity of suits in filing Civil Case No. 99-03169-D in RTC Branch 44 despite full knowledge of the pendency of Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D in RTC Branch 43; that since the one-year period of redemption has already lapsed, the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of respondent becomes a ministerial duty of the trial court; that the issues in Civil Case No. 99-03169-D are not prejudicial questions to Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D because: (a) the special proceeding is already fait accompli, (b) Civil Case No. 99-03169-D is deemed not filed for being contrary to Section 8 of Act No. 3135, (c) the filing of Civil Case No. 99-03169-D is an afterthought and dilatory in nature, and (d) legally speaking what seems to exist is litis pendentia and not prejudicial question. [18]\n\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration [19] but it was denied by the CA on April 26, 2001. [20]\n\nHence, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari.\n\nPetitioners pose two issues for resolution, to wit:\nWhether or not a real estate mortgage over several properties located in different locality [sic] can be separately foreclosed in different places.\n\nWhether or not the pendency of a prejudicial issue renders the issues in Special Proceedings No. 99-00988-D as [sic] moot and academic. [21]\nAnent the first issue, petitioners contend that since a real estate mortgage is indivisible, the mortgaged properties in Dagupan City and Quezon City cannot be separately foreclosed. Petitioners further point out that two notices of extra-judicial sale indicated that petitioners' obligation is P10,437,015.20 [22] each as of March 31, 1998 or a total of P20,874,030.40, [23] yet their own computation yields only P9,957,508.90 as of February 27, 1998.\n\nAs to the second issue, petitioners posit that the pendency of Civil Case No. 99-03169-D is a prejudicial issue, the resolution of which will render the issues in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D moot and academic.\u00a0 Petitioners further aver that they did not violate Section 8 of Act No. 3135 in filing a separate case to annul the certificate of sale since the use of the word \"may\" in said provision indicates that they have the option to seek relief of filing a petition to annul the certificate of sale in the proceeding involving the application for a writ of possession or in a separate proceeding.\n\nRespondent contends [24] that, with respect to the first issue, the filing of two separate foreclosure proceedings did not violate Article 2089 of the Civil Code on the indivisibility of a real estate mortgage since Section 2 of Act No. 3135 expressly provides that extra-judicial foreclosure may only be made in the province or municipality where the property is situated.\u00a0 Respondent further submits that the filing of separate applications for extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage involving several properties in different locations is allowed by A.M. No. 99-10-05-0, the Procedure on Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, as further amended on August 7, 2001.\n\nAs to the second issue, respondent maintains that there is no prejudicial question between Civil Case No. 99-03169-D and Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D since the pendency of a civil action questioning the validity of the mortgage and the extra-judicial foreclosure thereof does not bar the issuance of a writ of possession.\u00a0 Respondent also insists that petitioners should have filed their Petition to Annul the Certificate of Sale in the same case where possession is being sought, that is, in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D, and not in a separate proceeding (Civil Case No. 99-01369-D) because the venue of the action to question the validity of the foreclosure is not discretionary since the use of the word \"may\" in Section 8 of Act No. 3135 refers to the filing of the petition or action itself and not to the venue. Respondent further argues that even if petitioners filed the Petition to Annul the Certificate of Sale in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D, the writ of possession must still be issued because issuance of the writ in favor of the purchaser is a ministerial act of the trial court and the one-year period of redemption has already lapsed.\n\nAnent the first issue, the Court finds that petitioners have a mistaken notion that the indivisibility of a real estate mortgage relates to the venue of extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings.\u00a0 The rule on indivisibility of a real estate mortgage is provided for in Article 2089 of the Civil Code, which provides:\nArt. 2089. A pledge or mortgage is indivisible, even though the debt may be divided among the successors in interest of the debtor or of the creditor.\n\nTherefore, the debtor's heir who has paid a part of the debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the debt is not completely satisfied.\n\nNeither can the creditor's heir who received his share of the debt return the pledge or cancel the mortgage, to the prejudice of the other heirs who have not been paid.\n\nFrom these provisions is excepted the case in which, there being several things given in mortgage or pledge, each one of them guarantees only a determinate portion of the credit.\n\nThe debtor, in this case, shall have a right to the extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the portion of the debt for which each thing is specially answerable is satisfied.\nThis rule presupposes several heirs of the debtor or creditor [25] and therefore not applicable to the present case.\u00a0 Furthermore, what the law proscribes is the foreclosure of only a portion of the property or a number of the several properties mortgaged corresponding to the unpaid portion of the debt where, before foreclosure proceedings, partial payment was made by the debtor on his total outstanding loan or obligation.\u00a0 This also means that the debtor cannot ask for the release of any portion of the mortgaged property or of one or some of the several lots mortgaged unless and until the loan thus secured has been fully paid, notwithstanding the fact that there has been partial fulfillment of the obligation.\u00a0 Hence, it is provided that the debtor who has paid a part of the debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishment of the mortgage as long as the debt is not completely satisfied. [26] In essence, indivisibility means that the mortgage obligation cannot be divided among the different lots, [27] that is, each and every parcel under mortgage answers for the totality of the debt. [28]\n\nOn the other hand, the venue of the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings is the place where each of the mortgaged property is located, as prescribed by Section 2 of Act No. 3135, [29] to wit:\nSECTION 2. Said sale cannot be made legally outside of the province in which the property sold is situated; and in case the place within said province in which the sale is to be made is subject to stipulation, such sale shall be made in said place or in the municipal building of the municipality in which the property or part thereof is situated.\nA.M. No. 99-10-05-0, [30] the Procedure on Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, lays down the guidelines for extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings on mortgaged properties located in different provinces. It provides that the venue of the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings is the place where each of the mortgaged property is located.\u00a0 Relevant portion thereof provides:\nWhere the application concerns the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages of real estates and/or chattels in different locations covering one indebtedness, only one filing fee corresponding to such indebtedness shall be collected.\u00a0 The collecting Clerk of Court shall, apart from the official receipt of the fees, issue a certificate of payment indicating the amount of indebtedness, the filing fees collected, the mortgages sought to be foreclosed, the real estates and/or chattels mortgaged and their respective locations, which certificate shall serve the purpose of having the application docketed with the Clerks of Court of the places where the other properties are located and of allowing the extrajudicial foreclosures to proceed thereat. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe indivisibility of the real estate mortgage is not violated by conducting two separate foreclosure proceedings on mortgaged properties located in different provinces as long as each parcel of land is answerable for the entire debt. Petitioners' assumption that their total obligation is P20,874,030.40 because the two notices of extra-judicial sale indicated that petitioners' obligation is P10,437,015.20 [31] each, is therefore flawed.\u00a0 Considering the indivisibility of a real estate mortgage, the mortgaged properties in Dagupan City and Quezon City are made to answer for the entire debt of P10,437,015.29. [32]\n\nAs to the second issue, that is, whether a civil case for annulment of a certificate of sale is a prejudicial question to a petition for issuance of a writ of possession, this issue is far from novel and, in fact, not without precedence.\u00a0 In Pahang v. Vestil, [33] the Court said:\nA prejudicial question is one that arises in a case the resolution of which is a logical antecedent of the issue involved therein, and the cognizance of which pertains to another tribunal.\u00a0 It generally comes into play in a situation where a civil action and a criminal action are both pending and there exists in the former an issue that must be preemptively resolved before the criminal action may proceed, because howsoever the issue raised in the civil action is resolved would be determinative juris et de jure of the guilt or innocence of the accused in the criminal case.\u00a0 The rationale behind the principle of prejudicial question is to avoid two conflicting decisions.\n\nIn the present case, the complaint of the petitioners for Annulment of Extrajudicial Sale is a civil action and the respondent's petition for the issuance of a writ of possession of Lot No. 3-A, Block 1, Psd-07-021410, TCT No. 44668 is but an incident in the land registration case and, therefore, no prejudicial question can arise from the existence of the two actions. A similar issue was raised in Manalo v. Court of Appeals, where we held that:\nAt any rate, it taxes our imagination why the questions raised in Case No. 98-0868 must be considered determinative of Case No. 9011.\u00a0 The basic issue in the former is whether the respondent, as the purchaser in the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, may be compelled to have the property repurchased or resold to a mortgagor's successor-in-interest (petitioner); while that in the latter is merely whether the respondent, as the purchaser in the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, is entitled to a writ of possession after the statutory period for redemption has expired.\u00a0 The two cases, assuming both are pending, can proceed separately and take their own direction independent of each other. [34]\nIn the present case, Civil Case No. 99-01369-D and Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D are both civil in nature.\u00a0 The issue in Civil Case No. 99-01369-D is whether the extra-judicial foreclosure of the real estate mortgage executed by the petitioners in favor of the respondent and the sale of their properties at public auction are null and void, whereas, the issue in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D is whether the respondent is entitled to a writ of possession of the foreclosed properties. Clearly, no prejudicial question can arise from the existence of the two actions. The two cases can proceed separately and take their own direction independently of each other.\n\nNevertheless, there is a need to correct the CA's view that petitioners violated Section 8 of Act No. 3135 and disregarded the proscription on multiplicity of suits by instituting a separate civil suit for annulment of the certificate of sale while there is a pending petition for issuance of the writ of possession in a special proceeding.\n\nSection 8 of Act No. 3135 provides:\nSec. 8. Setting aside of sale and writ of possession . \u2014 The debtor may, in the proceedings in which possession was requested, but not later than thirty days after the purchaser was given possession, petition that the sale be set aside and the writ of possession cancelled, specifying the damages suffered by him, because the mortgage was not violated or the sale was not made in accordance with the provisions hereof, and the court shall take cognizance of this petition in accordance with the summary procedure provided for in section one hundred and twelve of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six; and if it finds the complaint of the debtor justified, it shall dispose in his favor of all or part of the bond furnished by the person who obtained possession.\u00a0 Either of the parties may appeal from the order of the judge in accordance with section fourteen of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six; but the order of possession shall continue in effect during the pendency of the appeal. (Emphasis supplied)\nUnder the provision above cited, the mortgagor may file a petition to set aside the sale and for the cancellation of a writ of possession with the trial court which issued the writ of possession within 30 days after the purchaser mortgagee was given possession. It provides the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in opposing the issuance of a writ of possession. [35] Thus, this provision presupposes that the trial court already issued a writ of possession.\u00a0 In Sps. Ong v. Court of Appeals , [36] the Court elucidated:\nThe law is clear that the purchaser must first be placed in possession of the mortgaged property pending proceedings assailing the issuance of the writ of possession. If the trial court later finds merit in the petition to set aside the writ of possession, it shall dispose in favor of the mortgagor the bond furnished by the purchaser. Thereafter, either party may appeal from the order of the judge in accordance with Section 14 of Act 496, which provides that \"every order, decision, and decree of the Court of Land Registration may be reviewed...in the same manner as an order, decision, decree or judgment of a Court of First Instance (RTC) might be reviewed.\" The rationale for the mandate is to allow the purchaser to have possession of the foreclosed property without delay, such possession being founded on his right of ownership. [37]\nAccordingly, Section 8 of Act No. 3135 is not applicable to the present case since at the time of the filing of the separate civil suit for annulment of the certificate of sale in RTC Branch 44, no writ of possession was yet issued by RTC Branch 43.\n\nSimilarly, the Court rejects the CA's application of the principle of litis pendentia to Civil Case No. 99-03169-D in relation to Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D. Litis pendentia refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of actions and that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious.\u00a0 For litis pendentia to be invoked, the concurrence of the following requisites is necessary: (a) identity of parties or at least such as represent the same interest in both actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the reliefs being founded on the same facts; and, (c) the identity in the two cases should be such that the judgment that may be rendered in one would, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the other. [38]\n\nApplying the foregoing criteria in the instant case, litis pendentia does not obtain in this case because of the absence of the second and third requisites. The issuance of the writ of possession being a ministerial function, and summary in nature, it cannot be said to be a judgment on the merits, but simply an incident in the transfer of title. Hence, a separate case for annulment of mortgage and foreclosure sale cannot be barred by litis pendentia or res judicata . [39] Thus, insofar as Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D and Civil Case No. 99-03169-D pending before different branches of RTC Dagupan City are concerned, there is no litis pendentia.\n\nTo sum up, the Court holds that the rule on indivisibility of the real estate mortgage cannot be equated with the venue of foreclosure proceedings on mortgaged properties located in different provinces since these are two unrelated concepts. Also, no prejudicial question can arise from the existence of a civil case for annulment of a certificate of sale and a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession in a special proceeding since the two cases are both civil in nature which can proceed separately and take their own direction independently of each other.\n\nFurthermore, since the one-year period to redeem the foreclosed properties lapsed on October 1, 1999, title to the foreclosed properties had already been consolidated under the name of the respondent.\u00a0 As the owner of the properties, respondent is entitled to its possession as a matter of right. [40] The issuance of a writ of possession over the properties by the trial court is merely a ministerial function. As such, the trial court neither exercises its official discretion nor judgment. [41] Any question regarding the validity of the mortgage or its foreclosure cannot be a legal ground for refusing the issuance of a writ of possession. [42] Regardless of the pending suit for annulment of the certificate of sale, respondent is entitled to a writ of possession, without prejudice of course to the eventual outcome of said case.

EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (NATIONAL IRRIGATION ADMINISTRATION), RESPONDENTS \n D E C I S I O N\nJAIME M. BARRIOS, SUBSTITUTED BY HIS HEIRS, ERLINDA BARRIOS AND CHRISTIANNE JOY BARRIOS, PETITIONERS, VS. EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (NATIONAL IRRIGATION ADMINISTRATION), RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nSANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:\n\nFor our resolution is the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision [1] dated February 9, 2001 and Resolution [2] dated April 30, 2001 of the Court of Appeals (Fourteenth Division) in CA-G.R. SP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No. 48150.\n\nThe pertinent facts as gleaned from the records are:\n\nJaime M. Barrios, now deceased, substituted by his heirs, wife Erlinda and daughter Christianne Joy, now petitioners herein, was employed on February 1, 1975 as a driver in the National Irrigation Administration (NIA), respondent.\u00a0\u00a0 On January 16, 1997, he retired as Driver-Mechanic 3 after rendering twenty-two (22) years of public service.\u00a0 He was then fifty (50) years old.\n\nFrom August 5 to 17, 1996, or five months and 11 days before his retirement, Barrios was confined at the Lung Center of the Philippines due to chronic renal failure and diabetes mellitus .\u00a0 Prior thereto, he had been suffering from diabetes for fifteen (15) years.\u00a0 After his discharge from the Lung Center, his condition did not improve.\u00a0\u00a0 On October 8-31, 1996, he was treated at the Manila Doctors Hospital for end stage kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy. On his second day, he began undergoing dialysis.\n\nOn September 2, 1997, Barrios filed with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) a claim for income benefits, pursuant to Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 626, [3] as amended.\u00a0\u00a0 The GSIS denied his claim on the ground that end stage renal disease and diabetic nephropathy are not among the compensable occupational diseases listed under Annex \"A\" of the Decree; and that there is no showing that his job as a driver-mechanic increased the risk of contracting the ailments.\n\nBarrios filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the GSIS denied the same.\u00a0 He then appealed to the Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC).\n\nOn January 15, 1998, while the case was pending in the ECC, Barrios passed away.\u00a0 The cause of death as shown by the Death Certificate was renal failure secondary to diabetes mellitus. [4]\n\nOn April 17, 1998, the ECC rendered its Decision affirming the GSIS ruling.\n\nThe heirs of Barrios then filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review.\n\nOn February 9, 2001, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision. The dispositive portion reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the present petition is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and accordingly DISMISSED, for lack of merit. Consequently, the Decision dated April 17, 1998 of respondent Employees' Compensation Commission in ECC Case No. MG-9371-1197 affirming the letter dated October 7, 1997 of respondent Government Service Insurance System denying the claim for income benefit is AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nIn denying the petition, the Court of Appeals held:\n\nPetitioners' arguments rest mainly on their claim that Jaime's circumstance was the same as those of Geronimo's.\u00a0 However, a perusal of the records of this case discloses that while Mr. Barrios had been, in his lifetime, contending that his case falls squarely under the Narazo Case, they however failed to present any evidence to establish the claimed similarities.\u00a0 There was no evidence to prove Jaime's nature of work and working condition.\u00a0 More importantly, no evidence whatsoever was presented on any reasonable relationship between Jaime's working condition and the disease which eventually claimed his life.\u00a0 All he and his heirs had were bare assertions that his job as a driver-mechanic increased the risk of him contracting the said disease.\u00a0 But bare allegation does not ipso facto make Jaime's disease compensable.\u00a0 Award of compensation cannot rest on speculations or presumptions.\u00a0 The beneficiaries must present evidence to prove a positive proposition.\u00a0 And, while it is not required that the work-connection be proved by direct evidence, it is however required that the claimant should at the very least submit such proof as would constitute a reasonable basis for concluding ailment or that such working conditions had aggravated the risk of contracting that ailment.\u00a0 Sadly, neither the deceased nor his heirs have discharged this duty and for this reason we have no recourse but to agree with the findings of the respondent ECC.\n\nFurther, assuming arguendo that indeed part of Jaime's work was to drive around Metro Manila for 3 to 5 hours daily, carrying officials of the NIA to their respective appointments, still, the Narazo Case cannot be applied to his case because his nature of work and work condition is not the same as in the case of Geronimo.\u00a0 While Geronimo was a Budget Examiner in the Office of the Governor primarily dealing with the detailed preparation of the budget, financial reports and review and/or examination of other provincial and municipal offices \u2014 a job requiring full concentration and thorough study of the entries of accounts in the budget and/or financial reports, Jaime's job, on the other hand, does not require the same degree of concentration as would make him forego urinating or control the same.\u00a0 His job requires skill not analytical thinking.\u00a0 And, unlike Geronimo, Jaime could relieve himself without having to worry about forgetting what the last transaction was, what the last entry in the ledger was, how much it costs or if the local government has fund for it. Moreover, while waiting for the officials of the NIA, Jaime has a waiting period which he can make use of the rest and relieve himself if need be.\n\nBesides, it is most probable that Jaime is not the only driver at the NIA and such being the case, he could not have been driving for the officials of the said office day in and day out.\u00a0 There would be others on duty and there must have been a working schedule being followed by the drivers of NIA so that not one of them would be unjustly burdened with driving everyday.\u00a0 In addition, we also find it impossible that the officials of NIA were attending meetings outside their office everyday that would warrant the daily driving activities of Jaime.\n\nPetitioners seasonably filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the Court of Appeals denied the same.\n\nHence, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari.\n\nThe sole issue before us is whether petitioners are entitled to income benefits under P.D. No. 626, as amended.\n\nSection 1(b), Rule III implementing P.D. No. 626, as amended, provides:\n\nFor the sickness and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, the sickness must be the result of an occupational disease listed under Annex \"A\" of these Rules with the conditions set therein satisfied; otherwise proof must be shown that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions.\n\nUnder the above Rule, for the death of Barrios to be compensable, petitioners, as claimants, must prove that\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 his sickness was the result of an occupational disease listed under Annex \"A\" of the Rules of Employees' Compensation,\u00a0 or\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 the risk of contracting the disease was increased by his working conditions. In Salalima v. Employees' Compensation Commission, [5] we\u00a0 held\u00a0 that\u00a0 where\u00a0 the\u00a0 disease\u00a0 or\u00a0 illness\u00a0 that\u00a0 caused\u00a0 the death or disability of the employee is not included in Annex \"A,\" his or her heirs are entitled to compensation if they can prove that the risk of contracting the disease was increased by his or her working conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 The law does not require that the connection be established with absolute certainty or that a direct causal relation be shown.\u00a0\u00a0 It is enough that the theory upon which the claim is based is probable.\u00a0\u00a0 Probability, not certainty, is the touchstone. [6]\n\nIn the instant case, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' main argument that a driver-mechanic in Metro Manila, tasked with transporting NIA officials to their destinations for several hours a day, would have severe problems associated with urinary functions.\u00a0\u00a0 Petitioners invoked our ruling in Narazo v. Empoloyees' Compensation Commission. [7] In this case, Geronimo Narazo (deceased, and substituted by his wife Amalia) was a former budget examiner in the Office of the Governor of Negros Occidental.\u00a0\u00a0 Geronimo's duties were preparing the provincial budget, drafting financial reports, and reviewing the budgets of provincial and municipal offices.\u00a0 He had to sit for hours and, more often than not, had to forego or even delay urinating so as not to interrupt his concentration.\u00a0 Moreover, he was under tremendous tension and pressure.\u00a0\u00a0 Because of the nature of his work, which required full attention and thorough studies of the entries of accounts in the budget and/or financial reports, he suffered uremia due to destructive nephropathy and benign prostatic hypertrophy which caused his death.\u00a0\u00a0 Although uremia is not among the compensable ailments under P.D. No. 626, we granted him compensation benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 We held that under the circumstances, the risk of contracting his disease was aggravated by his working condition.\n\nIt is true that the work of the late Barrios did not require analytical mental process.\u00a0\u00a0 As the Court of Appeals held, he did not have \"to worry about forgetting what the last transaction was, what the last entry in the ledger was, how much it costs or if the local government has funds for it.\"\u00a0 However, the Appellate Court failed to consider the nature of his ailment and the working conditions associated with his employment.\u00a0\u00a0 The court\u00a0 then failed to see the connection between these two.\n\nBarrios was diagnosed to be suffering from diabetes mellitus complicated by end stage renal disease. This is where the line must be drawn between him and Geronimo Narazo.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is \"a metabolic disorder in which the ability to oxidize carbohydrates is more or less completely lost, usually due to faulty pancreatic activity, especially of the islets of Langerhaus and subsequent disturbance of normal insulin mechanism.\u00a0 This produces hypoglycemia with resulting glycosuria and polyuria giving symptoms of thirst, hunger, emaciation and weakness and also imperfect combustion of fats with resulting acidosis .\" [8] Glycosuria is \"the presence of an abnormal amount of glucose in the urine.\" [9] Polyuria, in turn, is \"the passage of a large volume of urine in a given period.\" [10] A fundamental characteristic of diabetes, regardless of whether it is Type 1 (insulin dependent) or Type 2 (non-insulin dependent), is frequent urination or polyuria . [11]\n\nEnd stage renal disease, on the other hand, is attributable to complications of diabetes.\u00a0 The kidneys or renal system filter waste products out of the blood and recycle other important substances.\u00a0\u00a0 This ailment is the stage where the kidneys or renal system fail to perform their function of filtering waste products out of the blood.\u00a0 Damaging chemicals, such as creatinine and urea, remain in the blood, thus, necessitating dialysis or mechanical cleansing of the blood. [12]\n\nDiabetes is \"a deficiency condition marked by habitual discharge of an excessive amount of urine.\" [13] Simply put, a diabetic sufferer has to urinate frequently.\u00a0\u00a0 Otherwise, he will suffer nephropathy or kidney disease.\n\nRecords show that as a driver-mechanic, Barrios was tasked with transporting NIA officials, various consultants, and even World Bank officers, to different destinations in Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces of Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog.\u00a0\u00a0 These travels required him to sit behind the wheel for many hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Job efficiency required him to transport his passengers to their respective destinations on time.\u00a0 He thus faced a situation where he had to forego urinating for hours.\u00a0\u00a0 To this must be added the stress and strain every driver encounters while on the road. [14]\n\nWe have no argument with the finding of the Court of Appeals that as a driver, Barrios had waiting times during which he could freely relieve his bladder.\u00a0\u00a0 But what the court overlooked was his need to urinate frequently\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 due to his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 This ailment afflicted him not only when he was resting, but also when he was on the road.\u00a0\u00a0 With high ranking passengers in his charge, he had no choice but to drive continuously most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, his disease was aggravated. Nephropathy then set in with fatal results.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we must apply the avowed policy of the State to construe social legislation liberally in favor of the beneficiaries. [15] This is in line with Article 166 of P.D. No. 626, as amended, which reads:\n\nART. 166. Policy . \u2014 The State shall promote and develop a tax-exempt employees' compensation program whereby employees and their dependents, in the event of work-connected disability or death, may promptly secure adequate income benefit and medical or related benefits.\n\nP.D. No. 626 is a specie of social legislation.\u00a0 Its primary purpose is to provide meaningful protection to the ordinary worker against the perils of disability, the hazards of illness, and hardships of other contingencies which may result in the loss of income.\u00a0\u00a0 It seeks to give full force and effect to the policy of the State of giving maximum aid and protection to labor. [16] This is so mandated by Section 18, Article II of the Constitution which provides:\n\nSEC. 18. The State affirms labor as a primary social economic force.\u00a0 It shall protect the rights of the workers and promote their welfare.\n\nWhere, as here, there is a basis for inferring that the risk of contracting the disease was aggravated by the employee's working conditions, it is but proper that the ECC, tasked with implementing social legislation, adopt a liberal attitude in favor of petitioners, like the widow and orphan of the late Barrios.\n\nWHEREFORE, we GRANT the petition.\u00a0 The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals (Fourteenth Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 48150 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE . The GSIS is directed to promptly pay the petitioners compensation benefits arising from the death of Jaime Barrios pursuant to P.D. No. 626, as amended.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Corona, Azcuna, and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 29-33. Penned by Associate Justice Martin S.

NO. 163680, January 24, 2006 ]\n\nMONICO SAN DIEGO, PETITIONER, VS. EUFROCINIO EVANGELISTA, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nMONICO SAN DIEGO, PETITIONER, VS. EUFROCINIO EVANGELISTA, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nPetitioner Monico San Diego has been an agricultural tenant in a parcel of land (the property) located in barangay San Vicente, Sta. Maria, Bulacan, covered by TCT Number 98.728 (M) in the name of Andres Evangelista. After Andres Evangelista died in 1994, his son respondent Eufrocinio Evangelista inherited the property which has a total area of three hectares, 21,000 square meters of which are planted with rice and the remaining 11,200 square meters with bamboo.\n\nOn June 6, 1996, petitioner filed a complaint before the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) Region III Office, Malolos, Bulacan against respondent for maintenance of peaceful possession, enjoyment, and damages with respect to the bambooland portion of the property. He complained that respondent and some unidentified companions \"forcibly entered the [bamboo-planted portion of the property] and without authority of law and by means of force and intimidation cut down some of the bamboo trees [which he had] planted [thereon],\" without giving him his lawful share, and they threatened to continue cutting down the remaining bamboo trees and tried to dispossess him as agricultural tenant thereof. [1]\n\nRespondent countered that petitioner is a tenant only with respect to the riceland portion of the property, the bambooland portion not being tenanted. And he denied petitioner's claim of having planted the bamboo trees, he claiming that they have been existing since 1937.\n\nThe DARAB Provincial Adjudicator dismissed petitioner's complaint by decision of October 6, 1997, [2] holding, inter alia, as follows, quoted verbatim:\n\nx x x x\nA succinct reading of the contract of lease will reveal as to what intent of the parties maybe in interpreting the entire contract of lease; and on this point, note must be taken that per wordings in the contract of lease, the existence of which is admitted by both parties, that the thirty three cavans of palay per annum or forty-five (45) kilos per cavan during the wet season actually represents the equivalent of twenty-five (25%) per cent of the average harvests during the agricultural years from 1970, 1971, and 1972. No mention was made about the yield of the bambooland portion as to how much actually per year was the harvest for said three (3) agricultural years.\n\nIn view of this observation of this office, the Board is inclined to favor the view of the defendant that, indeed, only the riceland portion of the landholding is actually covered by the contract of lease and that the 33 cavans amount of rental per year during the wet seasons refers to the riceland portion of the landholding. x x x x [3] (Underscoring supplied)\n\nOn appeal, the DARAB, by decision of February 16, 2000, [4] reversed that of the Provincial Adjudicator, it holding that:\n\nx x x x\nThe agricultural leasehold contract executed between Plaintiff-Appellant and the late Andres Evangelista covers the lot consisting of three (3) hectares as evidenced by an Agricultural Leasehold Contract executed by herein parties on 4 September 1984 (Exhibit \"1\"; page 30, Rollo). Apparently, Plaintiff-Appellant is a tenant on the 3-hectare land and not on the 21,000 square meter area. Clearly, the bamboo land is part and parcel of the 3-hectare land . Nowhere in said contract excluded the bamboo land. The contract being the law between the parties is therefore binding between them. Indeed, Exhibit \"1\" produces effect as between the parties who executed the same. (Underscoring supplied)\n\nParenthetically, Republic Act 3844 categorically provides that \"in case there is doubt in the interpretation and enforcement of laws or acts relative to tenancy, including agreements between the landowner and the tenant, it should be resolved in favor of the latter, to protect him from unjust exploitation and arbitrary ejectment by unscrupulous landowners.\" [5] x x x (Underscoring in the original) His motion for reconsideration having been denied by DARAB resolution of January 12, 2001, respondent elevated the case via petition for review to the Court of Appeals which reversed the DARAB decision and reinstated that of the DARAB Provincial Adjudicator, by decision of December 18, 2003. [6]\n\nIn reversing the DARAB decision, the Court of Appeals observed:\n\nx x x x\nIn the case of Monsanto v. Zerna, [7] the Supreme Court laid down the elements of a tenancy relationship, which are:\n\"(1) the parties are landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; (2) and subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; (3) there is consent between the parties to the relationship; (4) that the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and (6) the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee.\"\nFollowing the guidelines set forth in Monsanto case, the Agricultural Leasehold Contract of private respondent with the late Andres Evangelista excluded the bamboo land area, for the simple reason that requisites 5 and 6 are wanting in the instant case.\n\nThe wordings of the agricultural leasehold contract itself which pertains only to the produce of rice belies private respondent's claim in paragraph 4 of his Complaint that \"... the subject bamboo trees were planted by herein plaintiff (now private respondent) when the latter started working as agricultural tenant on the subject landholding. \" Thus, no evidence of personal cultivation of bamboo trees was presented by private respondent other than his bare allegations to this effect.\n\nOn the contrary, it was established in the Affidavits or \"Sinumpaang Salaysay\" of several neighbors of petitioner, one of whom is a Barangay Chairman, that as early as 1957, Andres Evangelista during his lifetime was the one in possession of the bamboo land and actively administered the cutting of the bamboo trees thereon, which upon the death of Andres Evangelista was carried on by petitioner when he inherited the bamboo land in question.\n\nMoreover, it was aptly observed by the Adjudicator a quo in its reversed decision that:\n\n\"it is quite intriguing to one's conscience if there is any truth to the claim of plaintiff that he was the one who planted the bamboo trees existing in the landholding in question for it must be taken judicial notice of the fact that during the recent years, specially so at the age of the plaintiff, that it is no longer usual for a person of his age to claim that he was the one who planted the bamboo trees on the bamboo land portion of the landholding in question.\"\n\nMoreover, Exhibit 6-A which is the annual payment of lease made by private respondent, listed merely in a piece of paper, as kept by the late Andres Evangelista during his lifetime, clearly showed that the said payments corresponds only to the yield of rice over the portion of riceland and not on the disputed bamboo land. Again, no mention was made about the yield of the bamboo land as to how much per year was the harvest. Absent the essential elements of consent and sharing between the parties no tenancy relationship can exist between them. All told, private respondent is not a tenant in the subject bamboo land.\" [8] (Italics, emphasis and underscoring in the original, citations omitted)\n\nPetitioner's motion for reconsideration having been denied by the appellate court by resolution of May 25, 2004, he comes to this Court on petition for review on certiorari, insisting on his claim that the Agricultural Leasehold Contract (the contract) he forged with respondent's father covers the entire 3-hectare property.\n\nResolution of the petition hinges on the interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the contract.\n\nPetitioner harps on the wording of the following provision of paragraph 1 of the contract to support his claim:\nThat effective this agricultural year 1984, which is scheduled to start in the month of September 1984 and every agricultural year thereafter until terminated or modified in accordance with law, an agricultural leasehold relation under the terms and conditions herein under specified is hereby created between the AGRICULTURAL LESSEE and the AGRICULTURAL LESSOR over a farm lot which is a portion of a parcel of land situated at Barrio San Vicente Municipality of Santa Maria Province of Bulacan owned or legally possessed by the AGRICULTURAL LESSOR and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title and Number ___ (sic) which lot consisting of 3.00 has., is bounded on:\nNorth - land owned or cultivated by: River\nSouth -do- : Narciso Policarpio\nEast -do- : Norberto Lorenzo\nWest -do- : River\" [9] On the other hand, respondent refers to the following provisions of the contract to support his contention that the portion of the property planted with bamboo is excluded:\n\nx x x x\nThat the aforesaid is devoted to the production of palay crop(s) during the wet season.\nx x x x\nThat the rental for said land shall be 33 cav. per annum or xx cavans of xx (crop) of palay (variety) at 46 kilos per cavan of the wet, season, said rentals representing the equivalent of 25% of the average normal harvest during the agricultural year 1970, 1971, 1972, after deducting from the gross harvest ______ ( sic ). [10] (Underscoring supplied) And respondent invites attention to the omission to mention in the contract bamboos or the bambooland portion of the property.\n\nThe petition fails.\n\nAbove-quoted paragraph No. 1 of the contract relied upon by petitioner is clearly worded. It provides that \"an agricultural leasehold relation . . . is . . . created . . . on a farm lot which is a portion of a parcel of land\" covered by a transfer certificate of title consisting of three hectares, clearly referring to respondent's father's TCT No. 98.728 (M) containing three hectares.\nArt. 1370 of the New Civil Code which provides:\n\nArt. 1370. If the terms of the contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control. x x x x (Underscoring supplied)\n\nthus applies.\n\nPetitioner insists, however, that:\n. . . the thirty-three (33) cavans of palay which [he] agreed to pay to the predecessor-in-interest of respondent is really for the entire three (3) hectare landholding. This is so because a landowner/landlord is usually entitled to TEN (10) cavans of palay per hectare. [11] Petitioner's insistence, even if the literal meaning of the contractual provisions is set aside, does not lie.\n\nActs contemporaneous and subsequent to the execution of the contract [12] show that the parties intended to establish a tenancy relationship only as regards the rice-planted portion of the property.\n\nThus, petitioner has been paying rentals in palay , not in bamboo. Annex \"1\" of respondent's position paper submitted to the Provincial Adjudicator, [13] which is a handwritten list (\" Listahan ng Ani [of petitioner]\") made by respondent's father-predecessor-in-interest, shows under the column \" Bigay \" that petitioner was from 1981 up to 1994 paying annual rentals ranging from \"28\" to \"33,\" which figures are consistent with the earlier-quoted stipulation in the contract for petitioner to pay rental of 33 cavans of palay per annum.\n\nNeither does petitioner's suggestion that there was a prevailing custom entitling landlords to a share of 10 cavans of palay per hectare lie, it not having been proven in accordance with Article 12 of the New Civil Code which provides:\n\nA custom must be proved as a fact, according to the rules of evidence.\n\nThe evidence proffered by respondent on the other hand abundantly shows that the bambooland portion of the property has always been untenanted, which evidence has not been controverted by petitioner.\n\nIn fine, the contract, as well as the acts of both petitioner and respondent contemporaneous and subsequent to the execution thereof, shows that the parties established a tenancy relationship only with respect to the riceland portion of the property.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED . The decision of the Court of Appeals dated December 18, 2003 is AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, and Tinga , JJ., concur.\n\n[1] DARAB Records, p. 11.\n\n[2] Id . at 137-140.\n\n[3] Id. at 139-140.\n\n[4] Id . at 170-173.\n\n[5] Id. at 171.\n\n[6] CA rollo, pp. 155-163.\n\n[7] 423 Phil. 150, 161 (2001).\n\n[8] Supra note 6, at 161-163, citations omitted.\n\n[9] Exhibit \"1\", DARAB Records, p. 71.\n\n[10] Id.\n\n[11] Rollo, p. 12.\n\n[12] The pertinent provisions of the Civil Code provide:\n\nART. 1370. x x x\n\nIf the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.\n\nART. 1371.

SAN LORENZO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nIn this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitioner Republic of the Philippines seeks the reversal and setting aside of the Decision [1] dated May 23, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (CA)-Cebu City\u00a0 in CA-G.R. CV No. 73996 , as reiterated in its Resolution [2] of\u00a0 December 7, 2005, dismissing the Republic's appeal from an earlier \u00a0decision of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Danao City, which ordered the registration of title in the name of herein respondent San Lorenzo Development Corporation over a 64,909-square meter parcel of land in Barangay Maslog, City of Danao, Province of Cebu.\n\nThe facts:\n\nOn November 13, 1997, respondent San Lorenzo Development Corporation filed with the MTCC of Danao City an application for registration of title to a parcel of land, described as Lot 1 of the Consolidation-Subdivision Plan, Ccn-07-000094, being a portion of Lots 3151, 3152, 3158, 3159, 3160 and 3161, Cad. 681-D, Danao Cadastre, situated in\u00a0 Barangay\u00a0 Maslog, City of Danao, Province of Cebu, with a total area of 64,909 square meters, more or less. The application was docketed in the MTCC as LRC No. 100.\n\nOn November 14, 1997, the MTCC issued an Order setting the application for initial hearing\u00a0 on March 5, 1998. The Order required that a copy thereof be furnished the Commissioner, Land Registration Authority, for notice and for the necessary publication to be made.\n\nOn December 11, 1997, the Solicitor General entered his appearance as counsel for petitioner Republic and deputized the City Prosecutor of Danao City to appear in the case. On the same date,\u00a0 the Republic filed its opposition to the application.\n\nOn February 24, 1998, another Order was issued by the MTCC resetting the initial hearing of the application to June 15, 1998. This was followed by an Order of May 15, 1998, resetting anew the initial hearing\u00a0 to September 23, 1998.\n\nDuring the initial hearing, the respondent corporation, through counsel, offered in evidence the following documents to prove or establish the jurisdictional facts of the case, to wit:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nExhibit \u201cA\u201d | - The Petition for Registration containing seven (7) pages and mandatory annexes designated as A-1 to A-3;\nExhibit \u201cA-1\u201d | - Lot Plan No. Ccn-07000094 of Lot 1 comprising Cad.Lot Nos. 3151, 3152, 3158, 3159, 3160 and 3161;\nExhibit \u201cA-2\u201d | - Technical Description of Lot No. 1;\nExhibit \u201cA-2\u201d | - Technical Description of Lot No. 1;\nExhibit \u201cA-3\u201d | - Certification of Non-requirement of Surveyor's Certificate;\nExhibit \u201cB\u201d | - Order resetting date of Initial Hearing to September 23, 1998;\nExhibit \u201cB-1\u201d | - Newspaper Clipping;\nExhibit \u201cC\u201d | - Affidavit of Publication issued byBanat News;\nExhibit \u201cD\u201d | - Certificate of Publication issued by the Land Registration Authority;\nExhibit \u201cE\u201d | - Certificate of Posting issued by the Court Sheriff;\nExhibit \u201cF\u201d | - Certificate of Publication issued by the NPO;\nExhibit \u201cF-1\u201d | - Copy of Notice of Initial Hearing;\nExhibit \u201cG\u201d | - Copy of the Indorsement addressed to the Clerk of Court, MTCC, Danao City, from Salvador Oriel, Chief, Docket Division, Land Registration Authority, dated July 7, 1998; and\nExhibit \u201cH\u201d | - Notice of Appearance of the Solicitor General.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nExhibit \u201cA\u201d - The Petition for Registration containing seven (7) pages and mandatory annexes designated as A-1 to A-3; Exhibit \u201cA-1\u201d\n- Lot Plan No. Ccn-07000094 of Lot 1 comprising Cad.\nLot Nos. 3151, 3152, 3158, 3159, 3160 and 3161; Exhibit \u201cA-2\u201d - Technical Description of Lot No. 1; Exhibit \u201cA-2\u201d - Technical Description of Lot No. 1; Exhibit \u201cA-3\u201d - Certification of Non-requirement of Surveyor's Certificate; Exhibit \u201cB\u201d - Order resetting date of Initial Hearing to September 23, 1998; Exhibit \u201cB-1\u201d - Newspaper Clipping; Exhibit \u201cC\u201d - Affidavit of Publication issued by Banat News ; Exhibit \u201cD\u201d - Certificate of Publication issued by the Land Registration Authority; Exhibit \u201cE\u201d - Certificate of Posting issued by the Court Sheriff; Exhibit \u201cF\u201d - Certificate of Publication issued by the NPO; Exhibit \u201cF-1\u201d - Copy of Notice of Initial Hearing; Exhibit \u201cG\u201d\n\n- Copy of the Indorsement addressed to the Clerk of Court, MTCC, Danao City, from Salvador Oriel, Chief, Docket Division, Land Registration Authority, dated July 7, 1998; and Exhibit \u201cH\u201d - Notice of Appearance of the Solicitor General.\nThereafter, the case was called aloud in open court to determine whether there were other oppositors aside from the Republic. There being none, the court issued an Order of General Default on September 23, 1998.\n\nRespondent corporation, to prove that it and its predecessors-in-interest had been in possession of the land applied for in the concept of an owner peacefully, continuously, adversely and notoriously for a period required under the law, presented six (6) witnesses. The six, who were predecessors-in-interest of composite portions of the subject parcel of land, provided testimonies to the effect that they had been in possession of the land, and had subsequently sold their respective parcels thereof to the respondent. Their testimonies were supported by tax declarations and deeds of sale.\n\nOn October 12, 2001, the trial court rendered its decision [3] granting the respondent\u2019s application for registration of title, thus:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, Judgment is hereby rendered ordering the issuance of title to Lot 1 of the Consolidation-Subdivision of Plan Ccn-07-000094, being a portion of Lot 3152, 3151, 3158, 3159, 3160 and 3161, Cad. 681-D, Danao Cadastre, situated in the Barangay of Maslog, Danao City, Province of Cebu, Island of Cebu, containing an area of SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINE (64,909) square meters, for and in the name of San Lorenzo Development Corporation, with principal office address at Ground Floor, Stanford Tower Condominium, 1870 M.H. Del Pilar Street, Malate, Metro Manila.\n\nUpon finality of this Decision, let a corresponding decree of registration be issued in favor of applicant in accordance with Sec. 39 of PD 1529.\n\nSO ORDERED. On November 7, 2001, petitioner Republic filed a Notice of Appeal , therein making known that it was elevating the case to the CA. In the CA, the Republic\u2019s appellate recourse was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 73996 .\n\nIn the herein assailed decision [4] of May 23, 2005, the CA-Cebu City dismissed the Republic\u2019s \u00a0appeal. Its motion for reconsideration having been denied by the same court in its equally assailed resolution [5] of December 7, 2005, the Republic is now before this Court via the instant petition raising the following issues:\nWhether or not the defective and/or want of notice by publication of the initial hearing(s) of the case a quo vested the trial court with jurisdiction to take cognizance thereof; and\n\nWhether or not deeds of sale and tax declarations/clearances constitute the \u201c well-nigh incontrovertible \u201d evidence necessary to acquire title through adverse occupation under C.A. No. 141. In the matter of jurisdiction, petitioner Republic maintains that the MCTC never acquired jurisdiction over the case on account of its failure to conduct the initial hearing thereof within the period fixed in Section 23 of P.D. No. 1529, otherwise known as the Property Registration Decree, which mandates that the date and hour of initial hearing shall not be earlier than 45 days nor later than 90 days from the date of the Order. In the Republic\u2019s own words: [6]\nAfter a series of postponements, the trial court finally set the initial hearing of the case on September 23, 1998 in an order issued on May 15, 1998\u00a0 xxx. The notice of initial hearing, however, was issued only on June 6, 1998.\n\nPursuant to Section 23, P.D. 1529, the initial hearing of the case must have to be not earlier than forty-five (45) days and not later than ninety (90) days from the date of the order setting the date and hour of the initial hearing. The Order having been issued on May 15, 1998, the initial hearing should have been set not earlier than June 29, 1998 (45 days from May 15, 1998 and not later than August 13, 1998\u00a0 (90 days from May 15, 1998). Unfortunately, the initial hearing was scheduled and actually held on September 23, 1998, some forty-one (41) days later than the prescribed period.\n\nEven if counted from June 8, 1998 (date of notice of hearing),\u00a0 still the hearing on September 23, 1998 is seventeen (17) days\u00a0 late than the prescribed period of ninety (90) days, the last day of which\u00a0 fell on September 6, 1998. It is noteworthy that both parties invoke the decision of the Court in Republic v. Manna Properties, Inc. , [7] decided January 31, 2005, albeit each cites different portions thereof, and for different purposes. The common reliance on said case is well-placed as it is, indeed, of a similar factual setting. Furthermore, that case tackles the same two (2) issues presently raised: compliance with the jurisdictional requirements for original registration, and proof of possession for the requisite period.\n\nA careful reading of Republic v. Manna Properties, Inc. will support a finding in favor of the respondent but only as regards the issue of jurisdiction.\u00a0 Speaking on that issue, the Court\u00a0 in Manna Properties, Inc. , wrote:\nThe duty and the power to set the hearing date lie with the land registration court. After an applicant has filed his application, the law requires the issuance of a court order setting the initial hearing date. The notice of initial hearing is a court document. The notice of initial hearing is signed by the judge and copy of the notice is mailed by the clerk of court to the LRA [Land Registration Authority]. This involves a process to which the party applicant absolutely has no participation.\n\nPetitioner is correct that in land registration cases, the applicant must strictly comply with the jurisdictional requirements. In this case, the applicant complied with the jurisdictional requirements.\n\nThe facts reveal that Manna Properties was not at fault why the hearing date was set beyond the 90-day maximum period. x x x.\n\nWe have held that \u201ca party to an action has no control over the Administrator or the Clerk of Court acting as a land court; he has no right to meddle unduly with the business of such official in the performance of his duties.\u201d [8] A party cannot intervene in matters within the exclusive power of the trial court. No fault is attributable to such party if the trial court errs on matters within its sole power. It is unfair to punish an applicant for an act or omission over which the applicant has neither responsibility nor control, especially if the applicant has complied with all the requirements of the law. Moreover, it is evident in Manner Properties, Inc. that what is more important than the date on which the initial hearing is set is the giving of sufficient notice of the registration proceedings via publication. In fact, in its memorandum, [9] petitioner Republic \u201cconcedes (a) that respondent should not be faulted if the initial hearing that was conducted \u00a0on September 23, 1995 was outside the 90-day period set forth under Section 23 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, and (b) that respondent might have substantially complied with the requirement thereunder relating to the registration of the subject land.\u201d [10] Hence, on the issue of jurisdiction, we find for the respondent, in that its application for registration was rightfully given due course by the MTCC.\n\nHowever, on the more important issue of lack of evidence of possession on the part of the respondent for the period required by law, the balance must tilt in favor of the petitioner.\n\nVery evident from Republic v. Manna Properties, Inc. is that the reckoning date under the Public Land Act [11] for the acquisition of ownership of public lands is June 12, 1945 or earlier, and that evidence of possession from that date or earlier is essential for a grant of an application for judicial confirmation of imperfect title. Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act, as amended by P.D. No. 1073, provides:\n(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, since June 12, 1945 or earlier, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title except when prevented by war or force majeure . Those shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter. (Emphasis supplied) Similarly, Section 14 of P.D. No. 1529 \u2013 the Property Registration Decree \u2013 \u00a0provides, inter alia , as follows:\nSection 14. Who may apply. - The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:\n\n1. Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 , or earlier; (Emphasis supplied) Here, in support of its application for registration, the respondent corporation submitted a certification from the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) that the parcel of land sought to be registered forms part of the general area classified as alienable and disposable public land under Forestry Administrative Order No. 4-467 dated June 7, 1938. It also submitted tax declarations and/or clearances, the earliest of which is in the year 1964 for Lots 3150 and 3160; 1963 for Lot 3151; and 1948 for Lots 3152, 3159 and 3161.\n\nThe \u00a0respondent's \u00a0application \u00a0was granted by the two (2) courts below \u00a0on \u00a0the premise that, reckoned to date, possession of the subject parcel of land since the declaration of alienability and disposability on June 7, 1938 was more than fifty (50) years already. Adverse possession for at least thirty (30) years had long been completed. This reasoning was fraught with errors.\n\nFirst, the law, as mentioned earlier, requires that the possession of lands of the public domain must be from at least June 12, 1945 for the same to be acquired through judicial confirmation of imperfect title. Through the years, Section 48(b), supra , of the Public Land Act has been amended several times. The case of Republic v. Doldol [12] provides a summary of these amendments:\nx x x. The original Section 48(b) of C.A. No. 141 provided for possession and occupation of lands of the public domain since July 26, 1894. This was superseded by R.A. No. 1942, which provided for a simple thirty-year prescriptive period of occupation by an applicant for judicial confirmation of imperfect title. The same, however, has already been amended by Presidential Decree 1073, approved on January 25, 1977. As amended, Section 48(b) now reads:\n\n(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, since June 12, 1945 or earlier, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title except when prevented by war or force majeure . These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter.\n\nSection 48(b) of the Public Land Act, as amended by PD No. 1073, presently requires, for judicial confirmation of an imperfect or incomplete title, the possession and occupation of the piece of land by the applicants, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, since 12 June 1945 or earlier. This provision is in total conformity with Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree heretofore cited. As the law now stands, a mere showing of possession for thirty years or more is not sufficient. It must be shown, too, that\u00a0 possession and occupation had started on June 12, 1945 or earlier.\n\nSecond, the acceptance by the courts a quo of the CENRO certificate of alienability and disposability as evidence of possession since the date of said certificate is patently erroneous. According to the CENRO certification, the subject land was alienable and disposable public land since June 7, 1938. This certification does not in any way indicate that the respondent and its predecessors-in-interest had been in possession of the property as far back as 1938.\n\nThe Public Land Act requires that the applicant must prove two things, to wit:\nThat the land is alienable public land; and\n\nThat his open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the same must either be since time immemorial or for the period prescribed in the Public Land Act. [13] All that the CENRO certificate evidences is the alienability of the land involved, not the open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation thereof \u00a0by the respondent or its predecessors-in-interest for the period prescribed by law.\n\nAs \u00a0in Manna \u00a0Properties, \u00a0Inc., while \u00a0the \u00a0Court \u00a0acknowledges \u00a0tax declarations \u00a0as \u00a0sufficient \u00a0basis for inferring possession, the tax declarations presented by the respondent in this case do not serve to prove their cause:\n\nThe 1945 tax declaration must be presented considering that the date, 12 June 1945, is material to this case. CA 141 specifically fixes the date to 12 June 1945 or earlier. x x x Unless the date and month of issuance in 1945 is stated, compliance with the reckoning date in CA 141 cannot be established. [14]\n\nHere, the earliest of the tax declarations presented by the respondent was in the year 1948 for Lots 3152, 3159 and 3161; 1963 for Lot 3151; and 1964 for Lots 3150 and 3160. At best, the respondent corporation can only prove possession since said dates. This does not constitute the evidence necessary to acquire title through adverse occupation under CA 141, as amended.\n\nLastly, while it is true that the issue of whether or not the respondent corporation has presented sufficient proof or the required possession raises a question of fact, which ordinarily cannot be entertained in a petition under Rule 45, one of the exceptions to that rule is when, as here, the evidence on record does not support the conclusions of both the trial and the appellate courts.\n\nOn the whole, we find merit in the petition.\n\nWHEREFORE, the \u00a0instant \u00a0petition \u00a0is GRANTED . Accordingly, the \u00a0decision \u00a0dated \u00a0May 23, 2005 \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0Court of Appeals-Cebu City i n CA-G.R.

NO. 160652, February 13, 2006 ]\n\nHON. TOMAS N. JOSON III, IN HIS CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE OF NUEVA ECIJA, AND THE SANGGUNIANG PANLALAWIGAN OF NUEVA ECIJA, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND ELIZABETH R. VARGAS, RESPONDENT. \nD E C I S I O N\nHON. TOMAS N. JOSON III, IN HIS CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE OF NUEVA ECIJA, AND THE SANGGUNIANG PANLALAWIGAN OF NUEVA ECIJA, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND ELIZABETH R. VARGAS, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is a petition for certiorari [1] with a prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction. The petition seeks to set aside the Resolution dated 13 October 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 78247 granting the writ of preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining Governor Tomas N. Joson III (\u201cGovernor Joson\u201d) and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Nueva Ecija (\u201c Sangguniang Panlalawigan \u201d) from conducting proceedings in the administrative case against Mayor Elizabeth R. Vargas and from imposing the order of preventive suspension.\n\nThe Facts\n\nOn 8 January 2003, eight members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija (\u201cSB Members\u201d), filed with the Sangguniang Panlalawigan an administrative complaint against the incumbent Municipal Mayor of Aliaga, Elizabeth R. Vargas (\u201cMayor Vargas\u201d), for dishonesty, misconduct in office, and abuse of authority.\u00a0 The SB Members alleged that Mayor Vargas submitted to the Provincial Budget Officer two falsified documents, namely, Appropriation Ordinance No. 1, series of 2002 (\u201cAppropriation Ordinance No. 1\u201d) and Resolution No. 2, series of 2002, approving the enactment of Appropriation Ordinance No. 1. The administrative case was docketed as ADM. CASE No. 02-S-2003.\n\nOn 13 February 2003, Mayor Vargas filed a complaint for annulment of falsified minutes of session and appropriation ordinance with damages against the SB members before the Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City (\u201cCabanatuan RTC\u201d). The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 4442.\n\nOn 18 February 2003, Mayor Vargas filed before the Sangguniang Panlalawigan a motion to suspend proceedings and/or motion to dismiss due to the pendency of a prejudicial question in Civil Case No. 4442, specifically questioning the genuineness of the documents she allegedly falsified. [2] Without resolving the motion, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan passed Resolution No. 80-S-2003, dated 3 March 2003, recommending to Governor Joson the preventive suspension of Mayor Vargas for 60 days. [3] On 17 March 2003, the S angguniang Panlalawigan issued Resolution No. 105-S-2003, denying Mayor Vargas\u2019 motion to suspend proceedings and/or motion to dismiss. [4]\n\nMayor Vargas appealed to the Office of the President praying for the reversal of Resolution No. 105-S-2003 of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan . The case was docketed as O.P. Case No. 03-D-164.\n\nIn April 2003, Governor Joson issued an order of preventive suspension against Mayor Vargas. Mayor Vargas filed before the Office of the President a very urgent petition to set aside the suspension order.\n\nOn 22 April 2003, the Office of the President, through Acting Deputy Executive Secretary Manuel B. Gaite (\u201cSecretary Gaite\u201d), issued an Order, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nACCORDINGLY, the instant motion is GRANTED and the undated Preventive Suspension Order against Mayor Elizabeth R. Vargas of the municipality of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija is hereby lifted and set aside.\n\nVice Mayor Victorino E. Reyes who may have assumed the position of Acting Municipal Mayor of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, is hereby directed to cease and desist from performing the duties of and functions of municipal mayor and vacate the same pending final resolution of Administrative Case No. 02-s-2003. Mayor Vargas may now reassume his (sic) position as such.\n\nThe Department of the Interior and Local Government is hereby directed to implement this Order immediately.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5]\nOn 25 April 2003, Governor Joson filed with the Office of the President a motion for reconsideration. On 8 July 2003, the Office of the President issued a Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, the instant motion is hereby GRANTED, and the April 22, 2003 Order subject thereof is hereby recalled and set aside.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Order of Governor Tomas N. Joson III placing Mayor Elizabeth R. Vargas under preventive suspension for a period of sixty (60) days is hereby reinstated.\n\nThe Department of Interior and Local Government is directed to implement this resolution immediately.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6]\nOn 17 July 2003, Mayor Vargas moved for reconsideration of the Resolution dated 8 July 2003. On 18 July 2003, Mayor Vargas filed before the Office of the President an urgent motion to resolve O.P. Case No. 03-D-164.\n\nOn 23 July 2003, Mayor Vargas filed before the Court of Appeals a petition for \u201cCertiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus, with Urgent Prayer for Preliminary Injunction or Temporary Restraining Order,\u201d docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 78247.\n\nOn 14 August 2003, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, in the interest of justice, to the end that undue prejudice and/or injury may be avoided to any and all parties affected by these proceedings, as well as not to render nugatory and ineffectual the resolution of this Court of the issues herein presented, let a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER be issued, to be effective upon service and for a period of SIXTY (60) days, unless sooner lifted.\u00a0 ACCORDINGLY, respondents Provincial Governor and the SANGGUNIANG PANLALAWIGAN of the Province of Nueva Ecija are hereby commanded to cease and desist from conducting proceedings in ADMINISTRATIVE CASE No. 02-S-2003, and from enforcing the assailed July 8, 2003 Resolution of the Office of the President, through the Executive Secretary, which directed the reinstatement of the order for petitioner\u2019s preventive suspension.\u00a0 Furthermore, in view of the serious issues involved, let the hearing and consideration of the propriety of the issuance of a preliminary injunction be scheduled on September 2, 2003 at 10:30 AM, Paras Hall, Second Floor, Main Building, Court of Appeals, Ma. Orosa St., Ermita, Manila.\n\nIn the meantime, without necessarily giving due course to the instant petition for certiorari, respondents are directed to file a comment, not a motion to dismiss, within ten (10) days from notice.\u00a0 Petitioner, upon the other hand, has five (5) days from receipt of respondents\u2019 comment, to file her reply.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7]\nOn 13 October 2003, the Court of Appeals resolved to issue a writ of preliminary injunction to further enjoin and restrain Governor Joson from imposing the order of preventive suspension and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan from conducting proceedings in the administrative case against Mayor Vargas.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nThe Issues\n\nPetitioners contend that:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH MANIFEST PARTIALITY, ARBITRARILY, AND IN GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN ISSUING THE QUESTIONED ORDER BECAUSE \u2013\nRESPONDENT VARGAS AVAILED OF THE WRONG REMEDY WHEN SHE FILED CA-G.R. SP NO. 78247;\nRESPONDENT VARGAS CLEARLY FAILED TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES BEFORE SEEKING JUDICIAL RELIEF;\nTHE PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION ORDER WAS LEGALLY AND VALIDLY ISSUED.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED ARBITRARILY AND IN GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DIRECTING\u00a0 PETITIONERS \u201cTO CEASE AND DESIST FROM CONDUCTING PROCEEDINGS IN ADMINISTRATIVE CASE NO. 02-S-2003.\u201d\n\nTHE INSTANT CASE PRESENTS A SITUATION WHEREIN A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION MAY BE DISPENSED WITH BEFORE THE INSTANT CERTIORARI CASE CAN BE FILED. [8]\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe petition is without merit.\n\nPetitioners allege that Mayor Vargas should have filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure and not a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65. Furthermore, Mayor Vargas filed the action for certiorari even while her motion for reconsideration was still pending resolution before the Office of the President. According to petitioners, the Court of Appeals acted with manifest bias and partiality when it issued the writ of preliminary injunction against petitioners despite the filing of a wrong remedy and the non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\nUnder Section 1, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the writ of certiorari is proper when the following requisites are present:\nIt is directed against any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; Such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of its or his jurisdiction; and There is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\nMayor Vargas filed with the Court of Appeals a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of Secretary Gaite. Thus, in a Resolution dated 14 August 2003, the Court of Appeals stated:\n\nTo question the foregoing Resolution of respondent Executive Secretary, petitioner interposed the instant petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, essentially posing the following issues: (1) was it proper for respondent Executive Secretary to have ruled that petitioner is considered in default pursuant to Article 126, Rule XIX of the Rules Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991; (2) can the civil case filed by petitioner before the Cabanatuan RTC for annulment of falsified minutes of session and appropriation ordinance with damages be considered a prejudicial question which warrants the suspension of the proceedings in the administrative case; (3) has the respondent Sanggunian[g] Panlalawigan jurisdiction to hear the administrative case filed against herein petitioner, when the relief\u00a0 sought therein is her removal from office.\n\nAt first blush, the assailed resolution having being issued by the Office of the President, through the Executive Secretary, it would seem that the proper remedy is an appeal via a petition for review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 A perusal of the instant petition for certiorari would, however, reveal that petitioner is alleging that the challenged resolution was issued with grave abuse of discretion and beyond respondents\u2019 jurisdiction, hence, the appropriate remedy is certiorari under Rule 65 .\u00a0 Moreover, assuming arguendo that the proper remedy is a petition for review under Rule 43, the Supreme Court has oftentimes ruled that, in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of justice, a petition for certiorari may be treated as having been filed under Rule 43, in which case this Court chooses to do so, in view of the gravity and seriousness of the issues involved herein. [9] (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the appellate court in assuming jurisdiction over the case.\u00a0 The special civil action of certiorari is proper to correct errors of jurisdiction including the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. [10] All the issues submitted for resolution in the Court of Appeals involve questions of law which are reviewable on certiorari. [11]\n\nException to the Application of Exhaustion of\nAdministrative Remedies\n\nUnder the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, a litigant cannot go to court without first pursuing his administrative remedies, otherwise his action is premature and his case is not ripe for judicial determination. [12] A litigant should first exhaust the administrative remedies provided by law before seeking judicial intervention in order to give the administrative agency an opportunity to decide correctly the matter and prevent unnecessary and premature resort to the court. [13]\n\nHowever, the Court recognizes some exceptions to the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies. As held in Paat v. Court of Appeals : [14]\nx x x\u00a0 However, we are not amiss to reiterate that the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies as tested by a battery of cases is not an ironclad rule. This doctrine is a relative one and its flexibility is called upon by the peculiarity and uniqueness of the factual and circumstantial settings of a case.\u00a0 Hence, it is disregarded (1) when there is a violation of due process, (2) when the issue involved is purely a legal question, (3) when the administrative action is patently illegal amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, (4) when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned, (5) when there is irreparable injury,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6) when the respondent is a department secretary whose acts as an alter ego of the President bears the implied and assumed approval of the latter, (7) when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable, (8) when it would amount to a nullification of a claim, (9) when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings,\u00a0\u00a0 (10) when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, and (11) when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention.\nThe requirement of prior exhaustion of administrative remedies may likewise be dispensed with in the following instances: (1) when the claim involved is small; (2) when strong public interest is involved; and (3) in quo warranto proceedings. [15]\n\nIn this case, Mayor Vargas filed the petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals alleging that Secretary Gaite issued the Resolution dated\u00a0\u00a0 8 July 2003 with grave abuse of discretion. Mayor Vargas raised the following issues: (1) whether it was proper for Secretary Gaite to have ruled that Mayor Vargas is considered in default pursuant to Article 126, Rule XIX of the Rules Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991;\u00a0 (2) whether the civil case filed by Mayor Vargas before the Cabanatuan RTC for annulment of falsified minutes of session and appropriation ordinance with damages is a prejudicial question which warrants the suspension of the proceedings in the administrative case; (3) whether the Sangguniang Panlalawigan has jurisdiction to hear the administrative case filed against Mayor Vargas, when the relief\u00a0 sought is her removal from office. [16]\n\nThe issues raised are questions of law which involve the interpretation and application of laws.\u00a0 Resolution of such questions constitutes essentially an exercise of judicial power which is exclusively allocated to the Supreme Court and such courts as the Legislature may establish. [17] Since the issues involve purely legal questions which the court may review, exhaustion of administrative remedies may be dispensed with. [18]\n\nPropriety of the Preventive Suspension Order\n\nUnder Section 63 of the Local Government Code, preventive suspension may be imposed (a) after the issues are joined; (b) when the evidence of guilt is strong; and (c) given the gravity of the offense, there is great probability that the continuance in office of the respondent could influence the witnesses or pose a threat to the safety and integrity of the records and other evidence. Issues are considered joined when the complaint has been answered and there are no longer any substantial preliminary issues that remain to be threshed out. [19]\n\nIn its Order dated 22 April 2003, the Office of the President stated that the facts of the case do not warrant a conclusion that issues are deemed joined. Furthermore, the Office of the President found no basis for the issuance of the preventive suspension. The Office of the President explained:\nIn the administrative case, it appears that petitioner did not file, so far, an answer to the complaint thus the issues could not have been considered joined. What she did was to file a Motion To Suspend Proceedings And/Or Motion To Dismiss which was treated by the sanggunian as her answer.\u00a0 However, nothing in the records can be inferred that the petitioner intended the said motion to be her answer.\u00a0 In fact, when the motion was denied on March 17, 2003 through SP Resolution No. 105-s-2003, she immediately appealed the said Resolution to this Office.\n\nIn fine, no inference can be had that the motion filed was considered her answer otherwise, petitioner could have stated so therein.\n\nFinally, even assuming that petitioner\u2019s motion was already her answer and therefore, the issues have been joined, it is observed that the grounds cited by the sanggunian in recommending the assailed preventive suspension are general statements \u2013 mere verbatim reproduction of the provision of law, unsupported by any factual and substantial evidence.\u00a0 There is no showing that the evidence of guilt is strong, with both parties charging each other with falsification of documents.\u00a0 In fact, that is the subject of Civil Case No. 4442.\u00a0 Moreover, it cannot be said that the continuance in office of respondent could influence the witnesses or pose a threat to the safety and integrity of the records and other evidence.\u00a0 The recitals in SP Resolution No. 105 s. 2003 are unconvincing.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the instant motion is GRANTED and the undated Preventive Suspension Order against Mayor Elizabeth R. Vargas of the municipality of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija is hereby lifted and set aside. [20] (Emphasis supplied) It would thus appear that the grounds cited by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for recommending the preventive suspension of Mayor Vargas were just general statements unsupported by any evidence. This is contrary to the requisites for a preventive suspension which require that evidence of guilt must be strong and that given the gravity of the offense, there is great probability that the continuance in office of the respondent could influence the witnesses or pose a threat to the safety and integrity of the records and other evidence. The haste in issuing the resolution recommending the preventive suspension of Mayor Vargas is unreasonable considering the gravity of the effects of such suspension. Suspension from office of an elective official would deprive the electorate of the services of the person they have voted into office. As held in Ganzon v. Court of\u00a0 Appeals : [21]\nThe plain truth is that this Court has been ill at ease with suspensions x x x because it is out of the ordinary to have a vacancy in\u00a0 local government.\u00a0 The sole objective of a suspension, as we have held, is simply \u201cto prevent the accused from hampering the normal cause (sic) of the investigation with his influence and authority over possible witnesses\u201d or to keep him off \u201cthe records and other evidence.\u201d\u00a0 It is a means, and no more, to assist prosecutors in firming up a case, if any, against an erring local official. Under the Local Government Code, it cannot exceed sixty days, which is to say that it need not be exactly sixty days long if a shorter period is otherwise sufficient, and which is also to say that it ought to be lifted if prosecutors have achieved their purpose in a shorter span.\nHowever, upon motion of Governor Joson, the Office of the President reversed its previous order. Citing the case of Joson v. Torres , [22] the Office of the President held that Mayor Vargas\u2019 failure to file her answer in ADM. CASE No. 02-S-2003 was deemed a waiver of her right to file answer and present evidence. As a consequence, the issues were deemed to have been joined.\n\nIn the Joson case, this Court found inexcusable the failure of petitioner there to file an answer despite the grant of three extensions of the period to file an answer. It was only seven months later and after the lapse of all the extensions of time for filing an answer that petitioner there filed a motion to dismiss.\n\nIn this case, Mayor Vargas moved for a 15-day extension to file an answer. Before the lapse of the period of extension, Mayor Vargas filed before the Cabanatuan RTC a civil case for annulment of Appropriation Ordinance No. 1 and the Minutes of the Session of 7 February 2002 which were the bases of the administrative charge against her.\u00a0 Four days after the lapse of the period of extension, Mayor Vargas filed a Motion to Suspend Proceedings and/or Motion to Dismiss due to prejudicial question. Without resolving Mayor Vargas\u2019 motion, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan issued a resolution recommending the preventive suspension of Mayor Vargas for a period of 60 days. Unlike the Joson case, there was no unreasonable delay employed by Mayor Vargas in filing an answer. Instead of an answer, Mayor Vargas filed a Motion to Suspend Proceedings and/or Motion to Dismiss because of a civil case which she had earlier filed seeking the annulment of the appropriation ordinance and the minutes of session.\u00a0 The Joson case is therefore inapplicable to this case.\n\nValidity of appellate court\u2019s order for petitioners to cease and desist from conducting proceedings in Administrative Case No. 02-S-2003\n\nIn a Resolution dated 13 October 2003, the Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction to further enjoin petitioners from conducting proceedings in the administrative case against Mayor Vargas in order to prevent injustice. The Court of Appeals explained:\nIn a Resolution dated August 14, 2003, in order not to render nugatory the resolution of the present petition by this Court, We issued a temporary restraining order temporarily enjoining the Provincial Governor and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Nueva Ecija from conducting further proceedings in Administrative Case No. 02-S-2003, and from enforcing the assailed resolution of the Office of the President, which directed the reinstatement of the order for petitioner\u2019s preventive suspension.\n\nAfter taking into account the parties\u2019 arguments for and against the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in a hearing conducted on September 2, 2003, as well as respondents\u2019 comment and opposition dated August 25, 2003, and considering that the present petition is still pending resolution before this Court, We deem it wise to issue a preliminary injunction to further enjoin and restrain public respondents Provincial Governor and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan from conducting proceedings in the administrative case against herein petitioner, particularly in imposing the order of preventive suspension, so as to prevent any injustice and irreparable injury that might inure to herein petitioner if it is adjudged by this Court that a reversal of the assailed resolution is warranted.\n\nWHEREFORE , for the foregoing premises, petitioner\u2019s prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is hereby GRANTED .\u00a0 Petitioner is hereby required to post a bond in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) for the issuance of said writ, as required by Section 4(b), Rule 58 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nSO ORDERED. [23] Petitioners allege that the only issue presented in CA-G.R. SP No. 78247 is the validity of the reinstatement of the preventive suspension order issued against Mayor Vargas as embodied in the Resolution dated 8 July 2003 of the Office of the President. According to petitioners, the Court of Appeals therefore acted arbitrarily and in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in directing the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to cease and desist from conducting proceedings in Administrative Case No. 02-S-2003.\n\nPetitioners\u2019 contention is without merit. Two of the issues raised by Mayor Vargas in her petition to the Court of Appeals pertain to the proceedings in Administrative Case No. 02-S-2003, to wit:\u00a0 (1) whether the civil case filed by Mayor Vargas before the Cabanatuan RTC for annulment of falsified minutes of session and appropriation ordinance with damages is\u00a0 a prejudicial question which warrants the suspension of the proceedings in the administrative case, and\u00a0 (2) whether the Sangguniang Panlalawigan has jurisdiction to hear the administrative case filed against Mayor Vargas, when the relief\u00a0 sought is her removal from office. [24]\n\nIt is, therefore, apparent that the jurisdiction of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in the administrative case is an issue in the certiorari case filed in the Court of Appeals. Mayor Vargas is questioning the propriety of the proceedings of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan despite the alleged prejudicial question in the civil case. Likewise, Mayor Vargas alleges that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is bereft of jurisdiction over the administrative case which seeks her removal from office since under Section 60 of the Local Government Code, only the proper court may order the dismissal from public office of an elective local official. [25]\n\nWe find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals in issuing the Resolution dated 13 October 2003.\n\nWHEREFORE, we DISMISS the petition for lack of merit, and DENY the prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales and Tinga, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 41-42, 61.\n\n[3] Id., pp. 30-31.\n\n[4] Id., p. 61.\n\n[5] Id., pp. 34-35.\n\n[6] Id., p. 39.\n\n[7] Id., pp. 64-65.\n\n[8] Id., pp. 10-11.\n\n[9] Id., pp. 63-64.\n\n[10] Argel v.

      "title": "SCRA 606 [1991], where the Supreme Court ruled that company procedures for discipline do not require strict observance as long as the essential requirements of due process had been observed xxx.\u201d But even Mendoza favors the view that company procedure for termination should be implemented, even if not to the letter. In fact, in said case, the employer San Miguel Corporation implemented company procedure for termination by conducting a formal investigation, in question and answer form, against the employee Mendoza.In the present case, PLDT does not deny the existence of a company procedure in termination cases known as Systems Practice No. 94-016, which provides:Effective DateAugust 10, 1994HANDLING OF ADMINISTRATIVE CASESx x x xPURPOSEThis practice describes the procedural guidelines for handling administrative cases.GENERAL2.1 Investigation of offenses or infractions of Company regulations committed by employees shall be handled by various investigating units xxx;x x x x2.5 An employee under investigation for the commission of an offense or infraction shall be informed in writing of the particular act constituting the offense or infraction imputed to him. He may answer the charges against him in writing within a reasonable period of time (at least 48 hours but not more than 72 hours) or be afforded the opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of his counsel or union representative, if he so desires. (Emphasis supplied)PLDT, however, refused to implement said policy, contending that it applies to administrative cases only and not to strike-related cases such as the ones involving Suico, et al..[66]We are unable to see the difference. As pointed out by the CA in G.R. No. 163793, while it is true that Systems Practice No. 94-016 relates to administrative cases, PLDT failed to prove that a termination proceeding arising from strike-related violence is not an administrative case. If by administrative case, PLDT refers to cases arising from violation of company rules and regulations, then the proceedings against Suico, et al. were of that nature for the notices sent to said employees accused them not just of breach of Art. 264 of the Labor Code but also of behavior prejudicial to company operations and violative of the company code of conduct.[67] The termination proceedings against Suico, et al. were therefore administrative in nature, subject to the requirements of Systems Practice No. 94-016.To repeat, the requirements of due process by which to test the validity of the procedure adopted by PLDT in dismissing Suico, et al. are those embodied in Art. 277 (b) of the Labor Code, Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V and Systems Practice No. 94-016.Apparently, PLDT complied with the two-notice requirement of due process. The first notices sent to Suico, et al. set out in detail the nature and circumstances of the violations imputed to them, required them to explain their side and expressly warned them of the possibility of their dismissal should their explanation be found wanting. The last notices informed Suico, et al. of the decision to terminate their employment and cited the evidence upon which the decision was based.[68] These two notices would have sufficed had it not been for the existence of Systems Practice No. 94-016. Under Systems Practice No. 94-016, PLDT granted its employee the alternative of either filing a written answer to the charges or requesting for opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of his counsel or union representative, if he so desires.Suico, et al. exercised their option under Systems Practice No. 94-016 by requesting that a formal hearing be conducted and that they be given copies of sworn statements and other pertinent documents to enable them to prepare for the hearing.[69] This option is part of their right to due process. PLDT is bound to comply with the Systems Practice.Yet, instead of respecting the option exercised by Suico, et al., PLDT in G.R. No. 146762 arbitrarily disregarded the same and insisted that Suico, et al. submit their written answers first before their request for formal hearing can be entertained.[70] In G.R. No. 153584 and G.R. No. 163793, PLDT straightaway declared Mariano and Borje to have waived the right to be heard and, based on the available evidence, decided the cases against them.[71] Clearly, such refusal by PLDT to conduct a hearing was unreasonable and arbitrary as it defeated the exercise by Suico, et al. of an option which, by virtue of Systems Practice No. 94-016, was a component of their right to due process. The impairment of their option constituted an impairment of their right to due process.All told, the procedure adopted by PLDT in dismissing Suico, et al. fell short of the requirements of due process.It should be emphasized, however, that, consistent with our ruling in Agabon,[72] the procedural deficiency in the dismissal of Suico, et al. did not affect the validity or effectivity of the dismissal as the substantive bases thereof were never put in issue.[73] Thus, the April 12, 2002 CA Decision in G.R. No. 163793 was erroneous as it declared the dismissal of Borje illegal merely for failure of PLDT to observe due process. The CA should have affirmed the validity of the dismissal of Borje and awarded him nominal damages for the impairment of his statutory right to due process.WHEREFORE, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 146762 and 153584 are PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Decisions of the Court of Appeals dated September 22, 2000 and February 7, 2002, respectively, are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION to the effect that Culver B. Suico, Teresa D. Ceniza, Ronald R. Dacut and Benigno Mariano, Jr. are each awarded nominal damages in the amount of P30,000.00.The petition in G.R. No. 163793 is GRANTED. The Decision dated April 12, 2002 of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated January 26, 2001 and the Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission dated September 28, 2001 are REINSTATED with MODIFICATION that Ernesto Borje is awarded nominal damages in the amount of P30,000.00.Costs against PLDT.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, concur.[1] Rollo II (G.R.

ERNESTO BORJE, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBy Resolution dated January 17, 2005, [1] the Court ordered the consolidation of the Petitions for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court docketed as G.R. No. 146762, [2] G.R. No. 153584, [3] and\u00a0 G.R. No. 163793. [4]\n\nThey involve parallel facts and issues:\n\nG.R. No. 146762\n\nCulver B. Suico, Teresa D. Ceniza, and Ronald R. Dacut (complainants) were regular employees of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) Cebu Jones Exchange and members of Manggagawa ng Komunikasyon ng Pilipinas (MKP). In September 1997, MKP launched a strike against PLDT. \u00a0Complainants participated in the strike by picketing the PLDT. [5]\n\nActing Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Secretary Crescencio Trajano assumed jurisdiction over the labor dispute and issued a Return-to-Work Order on September 20, 1997. [6] MKP did not heed said order but merely filed an Opposition [7] thereto. \u00a0In an Order [8] dated September 29, 1997, DOLE Secretary Leonardo A. Quisumbing [9] denied MKP\u2019s Opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, at the PLDT, complainants continued with their strike. \u00a0On September 29, 1997, Ann Detelou Fernando (Fernando), a PLDT managerial employee, sustained injuries when strikers blocked her way to the premises of PLDT. \u00a0Complainants were implicated in said incident. \u00a0\u00a0Hence, Emiliano Tanchico (Tanchico), PLDT Vice-President for Personnel Management and Development Center, sent to\u00a0 complainants separate notices dated October 8, 1997, which uniformly read:\nPlease explain in writing why you should not be terminated for committing the following act:\n\nOn September 30, 1997, while participating in an obviously illegal strike, you physically assaulted Ms. A Fernando, a Traffic Supervisor. Attached as Annex \u201cA\u201d is the statement of Ms. Fernando.\n\nx x x x\n\nYour illegal act has seriously prejudiced the company\u2019s operations, is a violation of the Code of Conduct and is considered, among others, serious misconduct, which is a ground for termination under Article 282 of the Labor Code.\n\nKindly submit your notarized explanation to your Division Head within 48 hours from receipt of this Notice. Failure on your part to submit a written explanation within the given period shall constitute a waiver of your right to be heard. [10] Annex \u201cA\u201d to said notices is an unsworn statement in which Fernando gave a detailed account of the illegal act imputed to\u00a0 complainants. [11]\n\nComplainants did not file any explanation.\u00a0 Tanchico sent them two other sets of notices dated October 14, 1997 [12] and October 24, 1997. [13]\n\nOn October 27, 1997, complainants sent Tanchico separate but uniformly-worded letters which read:\n\nThis concerns your memo dated October 8, 1997 xxx.\nIn this regard, I hereby elect to exercise my right to be heard and defend myself in a formal hearing, to be set within five (5) days from my receipt of the documents hereinafter requested, pursuant to my right to due process and par. 2.5 of PLDT Systems Practice re the Handling of Administrative Cases. \u00a0Moreover, kindly furnish me with the copies of formal (written) complaint filed against me as well as statements of witness(es) and preliminary investigation report(s) regarding the complaint, if any.\n\nMy election to exercise my right to be heard and defend myself in a formal hearing is without prejudice to my right to submit a written explanation at a later time, which I hereby expressly reserve. [14] PLDT Division Head Augusto Cotelo (Cotelo) replied on November 3, 1997 that PLDT was deferring action on the request for formal hearing until complainants shall have filed their answers to the charges. \u00a0Cotelo wrote:\nPlease submit the notarized explanation that we required in our letters of October 8 & 14, 1997 within forty-eight (48) hours upon receipt of this letter, before we can consider any formal hearing. Please be reminded that we shall consider your failure to comply as a waiver of your right to be heard, and accordingly decide on the charges against you on the basis of the evidence on hand. [15] (Emphasis ours) Complainants merely reiterated their request for formal hearing. Thus, Cotelo sent them termination notices dated November 19, 1997 which read:\nIn light of the repeated demands and your consistent failure to provide the required written explanation for the following acts:\n\nOn September 30, 1997, while participating in an obviously illegal strike, you physically assaulted Ms. A. Fernando, a Traffic Supervisor. PLDT has proceeded to consider the charges against you for violation of Article 264 of the Labor Code and for serious misconduct.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the written copy of which were duly sent to you, the Company finds you guilty as charged. \u00a0The Company cannot see any reason why the evidence that the statements we considered were motivated by any purpose other than to bear witness to the truth. \u00a0We find these evidence direct and positive identification of your participation in and commission of the illegal act charged.\n\nYour act constitutes a just cause for termination under the Labor Code which authorizes an employer to terminate an employee for serious misconduct and which prohibits the commission of any act of violence, coercion or intimidation, or the obstruction of free ingress and egress, during a strike (see Art. 282-A & 264, Labor Code). \u00a0There is also the additional attendant circumstances that you committed these acts during a strike that was illegally declared and conducted. \u00a0Your services with Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company are consequently terminated effective upon receipt of this letter. [16] Complainants filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal and damages \u00a0with the Labor Arbiter (LA). \u00a0In a Decision dated July 15, 1998, the LA declared the dismissal of complainants illegal and ordered their reinstatement. [17]\n\nPLDT appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which, in its January 3, 2000 Decision, reversed and set aside the July 15, 1998 LA Decision, thus:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby SET ASIDE and VACATED and a new one entered DISMISSING the instant complaint.\n\nSO ORDERED. [18] Complainants filed a Motion for Reconsideration which the NLRC denied in its Resolution dated March 27, 2000. [19]\n\nThereafter, complainants filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 with the Court of Appeals (CA) but the latter dismissed it in a Decision [20] dated September 22, 2000, the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DISMISSED and the assailed decision and resolution are affirmed.\n\nSO ORDERED. [21] The Motion for Reconsideration filed by complainants was denied by the CA in its January 11, 2001 Resolution. [22]\n\nAnd so, the present Petition for Review where complainants question the CA for its September 22, 2000 Decision and January 11, 2001 Resolution on the sole ground that:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED THE INSTANT DISPUTE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT REFUSED TO CONSIDER THAT THE DISMISSAL OF HEREIN PETITIONNERS WAS MADE IN VIOLATION OF THEIR RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS. [23] G.R. No. 153584\n\nBenigno Mariano, Jr. (Mariano) was an employee of \u00a0PLDT Laoag City Sub-Exchange and an officer of \u00a0MKP. \u00a0During the September 1997 strike which MKP launched against PLDT, Mariano led a picket of the premises of the PLDT. [24] In said picket, Melvyn T. Guillermo (Guillermo), a PLDT subscriber, suffered injury and humiliation at the hands of a striker.\u00a0 In his letter to PLDT, Guillermo identified Mariano as the culprit and demanded that the latter be dismissed. [25]\n\nActing on the complaint of Guillermo, Tanchico sent Mariano the following notice dated October 13, 1997:\nPlease explain in writing why you should not be terminated for committing the following act:\n\nOn 19 September 1997, at around 11:50 a.m., you verbally and physically assaulted MELVYN T. GUILLERMO, a PLDT subscriber xxx.\u00a0 Attached for your reference as Annex \u201cA\u201d is the letter-complaint of Mr. Guillermo.\n\nThis act is illegal and violates express provisions of the Labor Code\u00a0 which among others provide:\nART. 264.\n\nx x x x\n\n(e) No person engaged in picketing shall commit any act of violence, coercion or intimidation or obstruct the free ingress to or egress from the employer\u2019s premises for lawful purposes or obstruct public thoroughfares. Additionally, as provided in the law, any worker who knowingly participates in the commission of illegal acts during a strike may be declared to have lost his employment status.\n\nYour illegal act has seriously prejudiced the company\u2019s operations, is a violation of the Code of Conduct and is considered, among others,\u00a0 serious misconduct, which is a ground for termination under Article 282 of the Labor Code.\n\nKindly submit your notarized explanation to your Division Head within 48 hours from receipt of this Notice. Failure on your part to submit a written explanation within the given period shall constitute a waiver of your right to be heard. [26] When Mariano did not reply, Tanchico sent him another notice [27] dated October 24, 1997, instructing him to submit his notarized explanation otherwise the charges against him will be resolved based on the available evidence.\n\nOn November 6, 1997, Mariano wrote Tanchico:\nSir, your memorandum dated 13 October 1997 xxx is a gross violation of my constitutional right as worker and employee to self organization xxx.\n\nHence, I hereby elect to exercise my right to due process, i.e., to be heard and defend myself in a formal hearing to be set within 5 (FIVE) days from receipt of documents hereinafter requested.\n\nPursuant to PLDT System Practice #94-016 dated August 10, 1994 (Handling of Administrative Cases), please furnish me a copy of formal (written) complaint filed against me, statement of witness/es and preliminary investigations and/or report/s conducted on the aforesaid incident, if any.\n\nMy option to be heard and defend myself in a formal hearing is without prejudice to my right of recourse at a later time which I hereby expressly reserve. [28] Hence, Reynaldo Puzon, PLDT Assistant Vice-President for North Luzon, sent Mariano a notice dated November 18, 1997, informing him of the termination of his employment, thus:\nxxx You asked in your letter that you be allowed to defend yourself in a formal hearing but you failed to provide a written explanation.\n\nIn light of the demands and your failure to provide the required written explanation for the following acts:\n\nOn September 19, 1997, at around 11:50 a.m., you verbally and physically assaulted Mr. Melvyn Guillermo, a PLDT subscriber who had just paid his PLDT bill at the company\u2019s Laoag Business Office. \u00a0After verbally abusing Mr. Guillermo by shouting invectives in his face, you boxed and slapped him, striking his face, left shoulder and arm. \u00a0PLDT has proceeded to consider the charges against you for violation of Art. 264 of the Labor Code and for serious misconduct.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the written copy of which were duly sent to you, the Company finds you guilty as charged. \u00a0The Company cannot see any reason why the evidence that the statements we considered were motivated by any purpose other than to bear witness to the truth. \u00a0We find these evidence direct and positive identification of your participation in and commission of the illegal act charged.\n\nYour act constitutes a just cause for termination under the Labor Code which authorizes an employer to terminate an employee for serious misconduct and which prohibits the commission of any act of violence, coercion or intimidation, or the obstruction of free ingress and egress, during a strike (see Art. 282-A & 264, Labor Code). \u00a0There is also the additional attendant circumstances that you committed these acts during a strike that was illegally declared and conducted. \u00a0Your services with Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company are consequently terminated effective upon receipt of this letter. [29] Mariano filed a Complaint [30] for illegal dismissal and damages with the LA but the latter dismissed it in a Decision [31] dated December 15, 1998. Mariano appealed to the NLRC but to no avail as the latter, in its\u00a0 December 27, 1999 Resolution, [32] affirmed the December 15, 1998 LA Decision.\u00a0 In its Resolution [33] of March 3, 2000, the NLRC denied Mariano\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nMariano filed a Petition for Certiorari [34] with the CA which rendered the following Decision [35] on February 7, 2002:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DISMISSED and the assailed decision and resolution are AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [36] Mariano sought reconsideration of the foregoing decision but the CA denied the same in its Resolution [37] of May 9, 2002.\n\nMariano is now before the Court in the present petition assailing the CA Decision and Resolution claiming that:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS HAD DECIDED THE INSTANT DISPUTE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT REFUSED TO CONSIDER THAT THE DISMISSAL OF HEREIN PETITIONER WAS MADE IN VIOLATION OF [HIS] RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS. [38] G.R. No. 163793\n\nErnesto Borje (Borje) was an employee of PLDT SFU Mother Exchange and a member of MKP. \u00a0During the September 1997 strike which MKP staged against PLDT, Borje took part by picketing the premises of PLDT. [39]\n\nIn a notice dated October 23, 1997 sent by Tanchico to Borje, the latter was accused of engaging in violent activities during the strike. \u00a0The notice read:\nPlease explain in writing why you should not be terminated for committing the following acts:\nOctober \u00a015, 1997, at around 8:35 a.m., you hurled a stone hitting the leg (below the knee) of Mr. Danny N. Garcia, OPM Supervisor xxx as a result of which Mr. Garcia suffered a contusion. Attached as Annex \u201cA\u201d is the incident report of Mr. Garcia; and\n\nOctober 15, 1997, at around 8:20 p.m, you threw stones at Mr. Amelito Visico, an employee of Southland Security Corporation of the Philippines assigned at the PLDT Exchange, San Fernando, La Union. Minutes later or at around 8:35 p.m., you again threw stones inside PLDT premises hitting and damaging the right side window of PLDT\u2019s service vehicle with body no. 96-495 and plate no. UJW-359. \u00a0Attached as Annex \u201cB\u201d is the Affidavit of Mr. Visico. This act is illegal and violates express provisions of the Labor Code xxx.\n\nAdditionally, as provided in the law, any worker who knowingly participates in the commission of illegal acts during a strike may be declared to have lost his employment status.\n\nYour illegal act has seriously prejudiced the company\u2019s operations, is a violation of the Code of Conduct and is considered, among others, serious misconduct, which is ground for termination under Article 282 of the Labor Code.\n\nKindly submit your notarized explanation to your Division Head within 48 hours from receipt of this Notice. Failure on your part to submit a written explanation within the given period shall constitute a waiver of your right to be heard. [40] Borje replied on November 7, 1997, to wit:\nSir, your memorandum dated 13 October 1997 xxx is a gross violation of my constitutional right as worker and employee to self organization xxx.\n\nHence, I hereby elect to exercise my right to due process, i.e., to be heard and defend myself in a formal hearing to be set within 5 (FIVE) days from receipt of documents hereinafter requested.\n\nPursuant to PLDT System Practice #94-016 dated August 10, 1994 (Handling of Administrative Cases), please furnish me a copy of formal (written) complaint filed against me, statement of witness/es and preliminary investigations and/or report/s conducted on the aforesaid incident, if any.\n\nMy election to exercise my right to be heard and defend myself in a formal hearing is without prejudice to my right to submit a written explanation at a later time, which I hereby expressly reserve. [41] Puzon sent Borje a notice dated November 18, 1997 informing him of the termination of his employment, thus:\nxxx You asked in your letter that you be allowed to defend yourself in a formal hearing but you failed to provide a written explanation.\n\nIn light of the demands and your failure to provide the required written explanation for the following acts:\n\nOn October 15, 1997, at aroun 8:35 a.m., you hurled a stone hitting the leg (below the knee) of Mr. Danny Garcia, OPM Supervisor. As a result of which Mr. Garcia suffered a contusion. \u00a0On the same day, at around 8:20 p.m., you threw stones at Mr. Amelito Visico, an employee of Southland Security Corporation of the Philippines assigned at the PLDT Exchange, San Fernando, La Union. \u00a0Minutes later or at around 8:35 p.m., you again threw stones inside PLDT premises hitting and damaging the right side window of PLDT\u2019s service vehicle with body no. 94-495 and plate no. UJW-359. \u00a0PLDT has proceeded to consider the charges against you for violation of Article 264 of the Labor Code and for serious misconduct.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the written copy of which were duly sent to you, the Company finds you guilty as charged. \u00a0The Company cannot see any reason why the evidence that the statements we considered were motivated by any purpose other than to bear witness to the truth. \u00a0We find these evidence direct and positive identification of your participation in and commission of the illegal act charged.\n\nYour act constitutes a just cause for termination under the Labor Code which authorizes an employer to terminate an employee for serious misconduct and which prohibits the commission of any act of violence, coercion or intimidation, or the obstruction of free ingress and egress, during a strike (see Art. 282-A & 264, Labor Code). \u00a0There is also the additional attendant circumstances that you committed these acts during a strike that was illegally declared and conducted. \u00a0Your services with Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company are consequently terminated effective upon receipt of this letter. [42] Borje filed a Complaint [43] for illegal dismissal and damages with the LA but the latter dismissed it in a Decision dated January 26, 2001. [44] Borje appealed to the NLRC which, in a Resolution dated September 28, 2001, held:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision under review is AFFIRMED and complainant\u2019s appeal, DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [45] Borje\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in its January 7, 2002 Resolution. [46]\n\nHowever, upon Petition for Certiorari [47] filed by Borje, the CA rendered on April 12, 2002 a Decision [48] the decretal portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. \u00a0The decision of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC is REVERSED and new one entered ordering the REINSTATEMENT of the Petitioner without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to grant him full backwages, to be computed from the time of his illegal dismissal without qualification or deduction. \u00a0Let the records of this case be REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for appropriate computation of backwages.\n\nSO ORDERED. [49] PLDT filed a Motion for Reconsideration but \u00a0the CA denied the same in a Resolution [50] dated June 1, 2004.\n\nPetitioner PLDT is now before the Court questioning the foregoing CA Decision and Resolution on this sole ground:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN HOLDING THAT THE NLRC COMMITTED A GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION IN AFFIRMING IN TOTO THE LABOR ARBITER\u2019S DECISION UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF RESPONDENT\u2019S DISMISSAL ON THE ISSUE OF ALLEGED LACK OF DUE PROCESS, THE SAME BEING CONTRARY TO LAW AND ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE THAT FOR CERTIORARI TO SUCCEED ABUSE OF DISCRETION MUST SATISFACTORILY BE SHOWN TO BE \u201cGRAVE\u201d, WHICH IS NOT SO IN THE CASE AT BAR. [51] [sic] The petitions in G.R. No. 146762 and G.R. No. 153584 are partly meritorious in that the CA did not err in upholding the validity of the dismissal of Suico, Ceniza, Dacut, and Mariano but the PLDT should be ordered to pay said employees nominal damages pursuant to Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission. [52]\n\nThe petition in G.R. No. 163793 is meritorious in that the CA erroneously reversed the NLRC by holding the dismissal of Borje illegal; but \u00a0PLDT should also be ordered to pay Borje nominal damages.\n\nIn the three petitions, the substantive bases of the dismissal of Suico, Ceniza, Dacut, Mariano and Borje (hereinafter collectively referred to as Suico, et al.) is not in issue. \u00a0Only the procedural aspect is in issue, specifically, whether PLDT violated the requirements of due process under the Labor Code when it dismissed said employees without heeding their request for the conduct of a formal hearing as provided for under PLDT Systems Practice No. 94-016 and prior to submission of their respective answers to the charges against them.\n\nThe minimum standards of due process in all cases of termination of employment are prescribed under Article 277(b) of the Labor Code, to wit:\nArt. 277. \u00a0Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\nx x x x\n\n(b)\u00a0 Subject to the constitutional right of workers to security of tenure and their right to be protected against dismissal except for a just and authorized cause and without prejudice to the requirement of notice under Article 283 of this Code, the employer shall furnish the worker whose employment is sought to be terminated a written notice containing a statement of the cause for termination and shall afford the latter ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the assistance of his representative, if he so desires, in accordance with company rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to guidelines set by the Department of Labor and Employment. (Emphasis supplied). It is implemented by Rule XXIII of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code, [53] which provides:\n\nSection 2. Standards of due process; requirements of notice.-\nI. For termination of employment based on just causes as defined in Article 282 of the Code:\n\n(a) A written notice served on the employee specifying the ground or grounds for termination, and giving to said employee reasonable opportunity within which to explain his side;\n\n(b) A hearing or conference during which the employee concerned, with the assistance of counsel if the employee so desires, is given opportunity to respond to the charge, present his evidence or rebut the evidence presented against him; and\n\n(c) A written notice of termination served on the employee indicating that upon due consideration of all the circumstances, grounds have been established to justify his termination xxx. It is the view of PLDT that in the dismissal of employees for strike-related violence, it is sufficient to merely declare the latter to have lost their employment without having to comply with any procedure for their termination. [54] PLDT is mistaken. \u00a0Art. 277 (b) in relation to Art. 264 (a) [55] and (e) [56] recognizes the right to due process of all workers, without distinction as to the cause of their termination. [57] Where no distinction is given, none is construed. [58] Hence, the foregoing standards of due process apply to the termination of employment of Suico, et al. even if the cause therefor was their supposed involvement \u00a0in \u00a0strike-related \u00a0violence \u00a0prohibited \u00a0under \u00a0Art. \u00a0264 (a) \u00a0and (e).\n\nMoreover, the procedure for termination prescribed under Art. 277(b) and Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V is supplemented by existing company policy. \u00a0Art. 277(b) \u00a0provides that the procedure for termination prescribed therein is without prejudice to the adoption by the employer of company policy on the matter, provided this conforms with the guidelines set by the DOLE such as Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V. \u00a0This is consistent with the established principle that employers are allowed, under the broad concept of management prerogative, to adopt company policies that regulate all aspects of personnel administration including the dismissal and recall of workers. [59]\n\nCompany policies or practices are binding on the parties. [60] Some can ripen into an obligation on the part of the employer, [61] such as those which confer benefits on employees [62] or regulate the procedures and requirements for their termination. [63] Thus, in Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company (BLTB) v. Court of Appeals , [64] the Court held that the employer BLTB is obliged under the Service Manual it issued to grant an erring employee the right to be heard and defend himself, and to apply the table of penalties fixed therein.\n\nIn its Comment to the Petition in G.R. No. 146762, PLDT objected to the application to this case of the ruling in BLTB , arguing that \u201cxxx the more appropriate case is Mendoza v. National Labor Relations Commission , 194 [65] SCRA 606 [1991], where the Supreme Court ruled that company procedures for discipline do not require strict observance as long as the essential requirements of due process had been observed xxx.\u201d \u00a0But even Mendoza favors the view that company procedure for termination should be implemented, even if not to the letter.\u00a0 In fact, in said case, the employer San Miguel Corporation implemented company procedure for termination by conducting a formal investigation, in question and answer form, against the employee Mendoza.\n\nIn the present case, PLDT does not deny the existence of a company procedure in termination cases known as Systems Practice No. 94-016, which provides:\n\nEffective Date\nAugust 10, 1994\nHANDLING OF ADMINISTRATIVE CASES\nx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\nPURPOSE\n\nThis practice describes the procedural guidelines for handling administrative cases.\n\nGENERAL\n2.1 Investigation of offenses or infractions of Company regulations committed by employees shall be handled by various investigating units xxx;\n\nx x x x\n\n2.5 An employee under investigation for the commission of an offense or infraction shall be informed in writing of the particular act constituting the offense or infraction imputed to him. He may answer the charges against him in writing within a reasonable period of time (at least 48 hours but not more than 72 hours) or be afforded the opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of \u00a0his counsel or union representative, if he so desires . (Emphasis supplied)\nPLDT, however, refused to implement said policy, contending that it applies to administrative cases only and not to strike-related cases such as the ones involving Suico, et al.. [66]\n\nWe are unable to see the difference. \u00a0As pointed out by the CA in G.R. No. 163793, while it is true that Systems Practice No. 94-016 relates to administrative cases, PLDT failed to prove that a termination proceeding arising from strike-related violence is not an administrative case. \u00a0If by administrative case, PLDT refers to cases arising from violation of company rules and regulations, then the proceedings against Suico, et al. were of that nature for the notices sent to said employees accused them not just of breach of Art. 264 of the Labor Code but also of behavior prejudicial to company operations and violative of the company code of conduct. [67] The termination proceedings against Suico, et al. were therefore administrative in nature, subject to the requirements of Systems Practice No. 94-016.\n\nTo repeat, the requirements of due process by which to test the \u00a0validity of the procedure adopted by PLDT in dismissing Suico, et al. are\u00a0 those embodied in Art. 277 (b) of the Labor Code, Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V and\u00a0 Systems Practice No. 94-016.\n\nApparently, PLDT complied with the two-notice requirement of due process. \u00a0The first notices sent to Suico, et al. set out in detail the nature and circumstances of the violations imputed to them, required them to explain their side and expressly warned them of the possibility of their dismissal should their explanation be found wanting.\u00a0 The last notices informed Suico, et al. of the decision to terminate their employment and cited the evidence upon which the decision was based. [68] These two notices would have sufficed had it not been for the existence of Systems Practice No. 94-016.\u00a0 Under Systems Practice No. 94-016, PLDT granted its employee the alternative of either filing a written answer to the charges or requesting for opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of his counsel or union representative, if he so desires.\n\nSuico, et al. exercised their option under Systems Practice No. 94-016 by requesting that a formal hearing be conducted and that they be given copies of sworn statements and other pertinent documents to enable them to prepare for the hearing. [69] This option is part of their right to due process.\u00a0 PLDT is bound to comply with the Systems Practice.\n\nYet, instead of respecting the option exercised by Suico, et al., PLDT in G.R. No. 146762 arbitrarily disregarded the same and insisted that Suico, et al. submit their written answers first before their request for formal hearing can be entertained. [70] In G.R. No. 153584 and G.R. No. 163793, PLDT straightaway declared Mariano and Borje to have waived the right to be heard and, based on the available evidence, decided the cases against them. [71] Clearly, such refusal by PLDT to conduct a hearing was unreasonable and arbitrary as it defeated the exercise by Suico, et al. of an option which, by virtue of Systems Practice No. 94-016, was a component of their right to due process. \u00a0The impairment of their option constituted an impairment of their right to due process.\n\nAll told, the procedure adopted by PLDT in dismissing Suico, et al. fell short of the requirements of due process.\n\nIt should be emphasized, however, that, consistent with our ruling in Agabon , [72] the procedural deficiency in the dismissal of Suico, et al. did not affect the validity or effectivity of the dismissal as the substantive bases thereof \u00a0were never put in issue. [73] Thus, the April 12, 2002 CA Decision in G.R. No. 163793 was erroneous as it declared the dismissal of Borje illegal merely for failure of PLDT to observe due process. \u00a0The CA should have affirmed the validity of the dismissal of Borje and awarded him nominal damages for the impairment of his statutory right to due process.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 146762 and 153584 are PARTLY GRANTED . The assailed Decisions of the Court of Appeals dated September 22, 2000 and February 7, 2002, respectively, are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION to the effect that Culver B. Suico, Teresa D. Ceniza, Ronald R. Dacut and Benigno Mariano, Jr. \u00a0are each awarded nominal damages in the amount of P30,000.00.\n\nThe petition in G.R. No. 163793 is GRANTED . The Decision dated April 12, 2002\u00a0 of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . The Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated January 26, 2001 and the Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission dated September 28, 2001 are REINSTATED with MODIFICATION that Ernesto Borje is awarded nominal damages in the amount of P30,000.00.\n\nCosts against PLDT.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, concur.\n\n[1] Rollo II (G.R.

ANGELES, AND JOCELYN P. CELESTINO,PETITIONERS, VS. HONORABLE VICENTE Q. ROXAS, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 227, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORPORATION, WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC S.A., WESTINGHOUSE INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS COMPANY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nChallenged via petition for certiorari is the Quezon City Regional Trial Court\u2019s Resolution dated April 17, 1996 dismissing the Complaint of Public Interest Center, Inc., Laureano T. Angeles and Jocelyn P. Celestino (petitioners) in Civil Case No. Q-95-25597, and Order dated June 18, 1996, denying petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe antecedent facts, as culled from the records of the case, are as follows:\n\nOn February 9, 1976, respondent National Power Corporation (NPC) entered into a contract (the Contract) with respondent Westinghouse Electric S.A. (WESA), an affiliate or subsidiary of respondent Westinghouse Electric Corporation (WESTINGHOUSE), whereby WESA undertook to construct in favor of the NPC a 620-megawatt nuclear power plant at Morong, Bataan and to supply equipment, machineries and services therefor. [1]\n\nWESA subsequently executed a deed of assignment transferring all its rights and responsibilities in the Contract to its construction arm-agent, respondent Westinghouse International Projects Company (WIPCO). [2]\n\nIn 1986, President Corazon Aquino issued Executive Order (E.O.) No. 55, which was later amended by E.O. No. 98, transferring ownership of the already constructed power plant, which had become known as the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP), its equipment, materials and facilities, records and uranium fuel, to the National Government or its duly constituted agency. [3] Pursuant to E.O. No. 55, as amended, the National Government assumed all remaining foreign and local obligations incurred by the NPC in financing the construction of the BNPP. [4]\n\nIn 1988, the Aquino administration instituted a complaint against WESTINGHOUSE in New Jersey, U.S.A. Westinghouse later filed an arbitration case in Geneva, Switzerland. [5]\n\nOn September 27, 1995, President Fidel Ramos authorized the following government officials as members of a Government Panel to conduct exploratory discussions with WESTINGHOUSE for the possible settlement of pending legal proceedings: Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Antonio T. Carpio, [6] Solicitor General Raul T. Goco, Assistant Secretary Cyril Del Callar, General\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Counsel Alberto L. Pangcog, and Counsel Mark Augenblick. [7]\n\nSubsequently or on October 4, 1995, President Ramos issued E.O. No. 265, which amended E.O. No. 315 dated January 1, 1988, creating the Presidential Committee on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (PC-BNPP Committee).\n\nE.O. No. 265 provided that the PC-BNPP Committee [8] \u201cshall be the coordinating and policy-making body on the BNPP, including policies arising from negotiations for a fair commercial settlement of all pending legal claims that will provide a substantial net benefit to the country,\u201d which \u201cshall submit its recommendations on BNPP-related policies to the President for approval.\u201d [9]\n\nOn October 11, 1995, the PC-BNPP Committee issued a \u201cRESOLUTION ADOPTING THE ESSENTIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARRIVED AT BY THE GOVERNMENT PANEL AND WESTINGHOUSE REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE EXPLORATORY DISCUSSIONS FROM SEPTEMBER 29, 1995 TO OCTOBER 9, 1995 FOR A COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT OF THE BNPP CONTROVERSY AND FAVORABLY RECOMMENDING APPROVAL THEREOF TO HIS EXCELLENCY, THE PRESIDENT,\u201d the salient points of which Resolution follow:\nx x x x\n\nNOTING that after a series of talks which started on September 29, 1995, the government panel and Westinghouse representatives (Mr. Briskman and Mr. Robert Gross) on October 9,1995, eventually agreed in principle on a settlement involving a package of more than $100 MILLION , consisting of the following:\n(1) $40 Million in cash (transferable by wire to a bank account specified by the Republic)\n\n(2) Two (2) newly manufactured 501-F Econopac combustion turbines, FOB Houston, at 160 MW each or a total of 320 MW valued at $30 Million each, or a total of $60 Million\n\n(3) Relinquishment by Westinghouse of the right to recover more than $200,000 in attorney\u2019s fees previously awarded by the New Jersey court.\nNOTING that in exchange for the foregoing cash and utilities, the parties would secure a dismissal with prejudice of the pending lawsuits, appeals and arbitration between the Republic and National Power Corporation, on one hand, and Westinghouse, its affiliates and Burns & Roe, on the other hand, involving the BNPP controversy and that the Republic would direct National Power Corporation and other government agencies to lift the ban against Westinghouse equipment and technology;\n\nx x x x\n\nOBSERVING that the present offer of Westinghouse of $40 Million in cash plus two (2) 501-F\u2019s worth $60 Million represents the highest cash offer (since its $10 Million cash offer in 1992) and the most advantageous in kind offer (no discount/rebate component or any corresponding obligation on the side of the Republic);\n\nHAVING IN MIND the uncertainty of the results of the arbitration, the possibility that some of Westinghouse\u2019s counterclaims may partly offset any recovery, the prospect that even a favorable arbitration award could be limited to the $40 million cap under the original BNPP contract and that even if the government eventually wins the appeal of the New Jersey verdict, substantial costs would have to be incurred to pursue a new trial, which result is also uncertain;\n\nRECOGNIZING that the present offer of Westinghouse will result in greater net economic benefits to the Republic than any previous settlement offer;\n\nx x x x\n\nNOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED that PC-BNPP, with the endorsement of the Republic\u2019s lawyers and negotiating panel, adopts the foregoing essential terms of the settlement agreement and respectfully recommends to His Excellency, President Fidel V. Ramos, the acceptance and approval thereof . [10] (Underscoring supplied)\nOn October 13, 1995, the Settlement Agreement reflected in the above-questioned Resolution of the PC-BNPP was forged by the Republic and NPC on one hand, and respondent Westinghouse corporations on the other. [11]\n\nOn November 14,\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01995, petitioners, as taxpayers, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City a Complaint against herein private respondents, for declaration of nullity of the BNPP contract with application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. [12]\n\nHerein public respondent, Branch 227 of the Quezon City RTC, set the hearing of petitioners\u2019 application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order on November 28, 1995 on which date only petitioners and respondents Republic and NPC appeared.\u00a0 No representative of the Westinghouse corporations having showed up, public respondent directed petitioners to secure a certification from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on who the resident agent, if any, of said corporations [13] was.\n\nOn the same scheduled date of hearing, the Solicitor General, on behalf of respondents Republic and NPC, moved for the dismissal of the Complaint on the ground that petitioners were engaged in forum-shopping, their counsel Atty. Crispin T. Reyes having previously filed cases [14] with causes of action identical thereto.\n\nWhile Atty. Reyes did not deny having previously filed, in Manila, a complaint, he argued that he was not among the plaintiffs in the complaint filed in Quezon City.\u00a0 Nevertheless, he withdrew as counsel for the plaintiffs \u2013 herein petitioners. [15]\n\nOn December 4, 1995, petitioners filed an Amended Complaint [16] praying for the following reliefs:\nWHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed [that]:\n\nx x x x\n\n(2) after due hearing, a preliminary mandatory injunction issue upon a bond executed to the party enjoined in an amount to be fixed by the court ordering defendants National Power Corporation and the Republic of the Philippines to stop and/or not to perform further implementation/execution of their obligation/undertaking under the null and void [B]NPP Nuclear Plant Contract between the National Power Corporation and Westinghouse executed on February 9, 1976 in Manila, Philippines; likewise, from further continuing the payments for the contracted loans/interest based thereon unless otherwise securitized; and also from further implementing/executing their undertaking/obligations under the Settlement Agreement between Republic of the Philippines-National Power Corporation and Westinghouse negotiated on October 9, 1995 and allegedly executed on October 13, 1995;\n\n(3) after hearing on the merits, judgment be rendered declaring the [B]NPP Nuclear Plant Contract executed on February 9, 1976 in Manila and all amendments thereto, together with the loan contracts based thereon, as well as the Settlement Agreement executed on October 13, 1995 by defendant Republic of the Philippines/NAPOCOR with Westinghouse, as inexistent and void ab initio ;\n\n(4) ordering defendants NAPOCOR and the REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES to reconvey/turn over the [B]NPP Nuclear Plant equipment and machineries to defendant WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORPORATION and/or its corporate agents and to restitute or refund to the former all payments paid for the [B]NPP Nuclear Plant to said Westinghouse, with legal interest from the filing of this complaint;\n\n(5) making the preliminary mandatory injunction permanent, and ordering defendant jointly and severally to pay plaintiffs reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Article 2208 (2) and (11), Civil Code of the Philippines, with costs against defendants; . . . (Underscoring supplied)\nIn essence, the Amended Complaint assailed the validity of and sought to nullify the following contracts:\n\n(a) The BNPP Contract;\n\n(b) The loan contracts entered into by the Republic and NPC to finance the construction of the BNPP; and\n\n(c) The Settlement Agreement entered into by the Republic and NPC with Westinghouse on October 13, 1995 in settlement of the claims arising from the Contract.\n\nThe Republic filed a Motion to Dismiss (With Opposition to the Application for Preliminary Mandatory Injunction) [17] to petitioners\u2019 Amended Complaint on the following grounds: (a) lis pendens and/or forum-shopping; (b) lack of legal capacity of petitioners to sue; and (c) lack of cause of action. [18]\n\nFor its part, the NPC filed its Comment/Motion To Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint, [19] alleging that the Amended Complaint failed to state a cause of action against it.\n\nBy Order of January 25, 1996, public respondent directed, among other things, petitioners and the Republic and NPC to file their respective memoranda. [20]\n\nOn February 26, 1996, petitioners, in compliance with public respondent\u2019s order, filed a manifestation that per certification of the SEC, the new resident agent of WIPCO was ACCRA Agents, Inc. \u00a0Summons was thereupon served upon ACCRA Agents, Inc.\n\nWIPCO soon filed a Motion to Dismiss [21] petitioners\u2019 Amended Complaint on the following grounds: (a) petitioners have no legal capacity to sue; (b) the Amended Complaint states no cause of action; and (c) assuming the existence of a cause of action, the same is nonetheless barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nBy the assailed Resolution of April 17, 1996, public respondent DISMISSED petitioners\u2019 complaint, holding as follows:\nx x x x\nthat, with respect to the first cause of action\n\n(i) plaintiffs have violated Supreme Court Administrative Circular 04-94, otherwise known as the Anti-Forum Shopping Rule , which carries with it, among others, the penalty of dismissal of the action;\n\nthat, with respect to the second cause of action,\n\n(i) this Court has no territorial jurisdiction over foreign and international bodies situated abroad, more so, if such bodies are foreign and international courts;\n\n(ii) this Court has no original and exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of invalidating compromise agreements entered into in foreign and international courts to settle foreign lawsuits pending before such foreign and international courts;\n\n(iii) this Court has no jurisdiction to enjoin court proceedings relative to the compromise agreement entered into in foreign and international courts to settle pending foreign lawsuits;\n\n(iv) the application for preliminary mandatory injunction of plaintiffs is denied for lack of merit . . .\n\n(v) the second cause of action did not allege constitutional, public interest, and judicial policy issues so as to qualify plaintiffs under the relaxed rule, as having standing , . . .\n\n(vi) this Court has not acquired jurisdiction over the persons of foreign defendants WELCO and WESA . . .\u00a0 (Underscoring supplied)\nPetitioners\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration of public respondent\u2019s Resolution dismissing their complaint having been denied by the other assailed Order of June 18, 1996, they filed the present Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus With Application for A Writ Of Preliminary Injunction And Prayer For A Temporary Restraining Order directly with this Court in view of the \u201ctranscendental importance\u201d of the issues involved.\n\nPetitioners contend that in dismissing their Amended Complaint, public respondent abdicated its constitutional duty to exercise judicial review over the validity of the BNPP Contract, the loan contracts, and the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\nPetitioners further contend that, contrary to the finding of public respondent, petitioners did not commit forum-shopping since there is no identity of parties and causes of action in the instant case and in the complaint filed before the Manila RTC.\n\nFinally, petitioners contend that they have sufficiently established that the injury caused to them by the contracts are \u201cactual, direct and immediate\u201d to thus clothe them with standing.\n\nThe Solicitor General and WIPCO, opposing the petition, argue that no grave abuse of discretion attended the issuance by public respondent of the assailed resolutions considering that, among other things, petitioners are guilty of forum-shopping; petitioners have no legal standing; and the propriety of entering into a settlement agreement involves a political question and is not subject to judicial review.\n\nThe issues then are:\n\n(1) Whether petitioners have legal standing;\n\n(2) Whether petitioners are engaged in forum-shopping;\n\n(3) Whether the validity of the Contract and the contracts of loan entered into by the Republic and NPC with foreign banks to finance the construction of the BNPP, and the propriety of entering into a Settlement Agreement are subject to judicial review; and\n\n(4) Whether courts may set aside a final judgment rendered by a foreign court.\n\nLegal Standing\n\nIn Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora , [22] this Court defined legal standing as follows:\n\u201cLegal standing\u201d or locus standi has been defined as a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged . The term \u201cinterest\u201d means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges \u201csuch personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied)\nIn public suits, the plaintiff, representing the general public, asserts a \"public right\" in assailing an allegedly illegal official action.\u00a0 The plaintiff may be a person who is affected no differently from any other person, and could be suing as a \u201cstranger,\u201d or as a \u201ccitizen\u201d or \u201ctaxpayer.\u201d\u00a0 To invest him with locus standi , the plaintiff has to adequately show that he is entitled to judicial protection and has a sufficient interest in the vindication of the asserted public right. [23]\n\nIn the case of taxpayers\u2019 suits, the party suing as a taxpayer must prove that he has sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation. \u00a0Thus, taxpayers have been allowed to sue where there is a claim that public funds are illegally disbursed or that public money is being deflected to any improper purpose, or that public funds are wasted through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law. [24]\n\nMore particularly, the taxpayer must establish that he has a personal and substantial interest in the case and that he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of its enforcement [25] or that he stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the case, or is entitled to the avails of the suit. [26]\n\nPetitioners\u2019 allegations in their Amended Complaint that the loan contracts entered into by the Republic and NPC are serviced or paid through a disbursement of public funds are not disputed by respondents, hence, they are invested with personality to institute the same.\n\nForum-Shopping\n\nForum shopping exists when, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than by appeal or certiorari ) in another, or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition. [27]\nAs explained by this Court in First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals , forum-shopping exists where the elements of litis pendentia are present, and where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in the other. Thus, there is forum-shopping when, between an action pending before this Court and another one, there exist: \"a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions, b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts, and c) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the other action, will, regardless of which party is successful amount to res judicata in the action under consideration; said requisites also constitutive of the requisites for auter action pendant or lis pendens.\" . . . [W]here a litigant sues the same party against whom another action or actions for the alleged violation of the same right and the enforcement of the same relief is/are still pending, the defense of litis pendentia in one case is a bar to the others; and, a final judgment in one would constitute res judicata and thus would cause the dismissal of the rest.\" [28] In determining whether forum shopping exists, it is important to consider the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues. [29]\n\nIn the present case, it is evident that, vis a vis the above-mentioned complaint filed in Manila, there exists identity of parties or interests represented, as well as identity of rights or causes of action and reliefs sought.\n\nThus, the first complaint which was instituted before the Manila RTC by the Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, et al. as taxpayers\u2019 suit, [30] \u201cAnti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc., et al. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., et al.,\u201d docketed as Civil Case No. 93-66916, sought to declare null and void the Contract, as well as the same loan contracts entered into by herein respondents Republic and NPC with foreign banks, and to restrain said respondents from making further payments in compliance with the loan contracts. [31]\n\nIt appears that the first complaint was dismissed by the Manila RTC upon a motion to dismiss. [32] It further appears that instead of filing an appeal, the therein petitioners Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc. et al. filed a petition for certiorari with this Court, which was dismissed by Resolution dated March 1, 1995, [33] and that thereafter or on July 12, 1995, they filed a petition for mandamus [34] with the Court of Appeals praying for the following reliefs:\n. . . that a temporary restraining order be ISSUED ex-parte enjoining respondent NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION and the REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES from paying the loans in question they contracted with respondent banks and insurance companies for a period of TWENTY (20) DAYS from date of issuance; that after notice to respondents and within said period, said temporary restraining order be CONVERTED into a preliminary injunction with bond as may be fixed by the Court; that after hearing, judgment be RENDERED making the preliminary injunction permanent and ordering respondent court to reinstate Civil Case No. 93-66916 and to declare respondents WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP. (WELCO) and WESTINGHOUSE INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS CO. (WIPCO), respondents foreign banks and insurances companies IN DEFAULT . . . (Emphasis supplied) The above-said petition for mandamus was still pending before the appellate court when herein petitioners filed their complaint, later amended, before the Quezon City RTC.\n\nPetitioners do not deny that the first complaint and the petition for mandamus (\u201cfirst set of cases\u201d) and their complaint subject of the present petition involve the same causes of action, are founded upon the same set of facts, and are taxpayers\u2019 suits.\u00a0 Nevertheless, they argue that the first set of cases and the present case do not have identity of parties since they were not among the petitioners in the former.\n\nFurthermore, petitioners assert that a taxpayer\u2019s suit is not a class suit, hence, judgment in one case does not amount to res judicata in the other.\n\nAt all events, petitioners contend that there is no absolute identity of causes of action since their Amended Complaint includes the nullification of the Settlement Agreement, which was not raised in the first set of cases.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s position does not impress.\n\nA taxpayer\u2019s action has been defined as follows:\nA taxpayer's bill is essentially a class bill and can be filed only in the common interest of all the taxpayers of the municipality, to prevent the wrongful expenditure of the money of the municipality or the wasting of its assets.\u2019 Schlanger v. West Berwick Borough, 261 Pa. 605, 608, 104 A. 764. \u2018A class bill, as its name implies, is a bill by several members of a class, on behalf of themselves and all others in the class, and no relief can be granted upon it, except upon a ground which is common to all the members of the class. [Citing cases].\u2019 Ashcom v. Westmont Borough, 298 Pa. 203, 208, 148 A. 112, 114. [35] (Emphasis supplied)\n\nAs to plaintiffs, both suits are brought by the plaintiff as a citizen and taxpayer, besides as an individual, and therefore they are taxpayer class actions. x x x,\n\nIn Holman v. Bridges , 165 Ga. 296(2), 140 S.E. 886, this court held: \u201cWhere a taxpayer or property owner brings an action against a county or its officers upon a matter of public or general interest to all other taxpayers of such political subdivision, and the action either expressly or by necessary implication is on their behalf, they are equally bound by the adjudication , and a judgment is a bar to any subsequent proceeding by them or any of them seeking similar relief upon the same facts. x x x\u201d [36] (Emphasis supplied) The general principle of class actions that a judgment in favor of or against the parties representing the general class is, under the doctrine of res judicata , in favor of or against all who are thus represented applies to litigations instituted by taxpayers.\n\nAccordingly, in a suit brought by citizens and taxpayers to determine a public right or a matter of public interest, all citizens and taxpayers are regarded as parties to the proceedings by representation and are bound by the judgment rendered therein. [37]\nThe plaintiff there was another taxpayer of the city, suing in the status of \u2018citizen and taxpayer,\u2019 and the city itself was a co-defendant. The action was instituted September 3, 1958. The first count of the complaint, Inter alia, c harged the affiliation agreement here in question to be \u2018void, illegal and of no effect because the City ignored the requirements of the \u2018local budget law,\u2019 N.J.S. 40:2-1 et seq., particularly 40:2-29 and the law pertaining to municipal contracts, particularly 40:50-6, as to the necessity for either budgeting the contract or passing an appropriation ordinance * * *.' Subsequently the plaintiff in that action made a motion for summary judgment on the first count alone, and defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. We have examined the briefs and affidavits submitted to the trial court on those motions, and it appears therefrom that the matter of the alleged invalidity of the affiliation agreement for alleged noncompliance with N.J.S.A. 40:2-29 and 40:50-6 was argued to the court. The judgment of the court denied plaintiff's motion and granted those of defendants . No appeal therefrom was taken.\n\nx x x x\n\nPetitioner first seeks to avoid the effect of the prior judgment on the ground that the subject matter of the two respective proceedings differs. However, this is not, properly speaking, a case of different subject matter, but of different causes of action. Such a difference is immaterial if a postulate of law essential to the success of the party in the later proceeding has been distinctly put in issue and adjudicated Contra in the earlier, particularly where, as here, the subject matter in both proceedings arises out of the same transaction . See 30A Am.Jur., Judgments, s 360, p. 401; Restatement, Judgments, ss 68, 70, comment pp. 319, 320; N.J. Highway Authority v. Renner, 18 N.J. 485, 493, 494, 114 A.2d 555 (1955); Mazzilli v. Accident, etc., Casualty Ins. Co., etc., 26 N.J. 307, 314, 139 A.2d 741 (1958) (quotation from City of Paterson v. Baker, 51 N.J.Eq. 49, 26 A. 324 (Ch.1893)).\n\nNor will it avail petitioner that the taxpayer in the earlier action was one other than herself. A taxpayer attacking governmental action in which he has no peculiar personal or special interest is taken to be suing as a representative of all taxpayers as a class. The general rule is that in the absence of fraud or collusion a judgment for or against a governmental body in such an action is binding and conclusive on all residents, citizens and taxpayers with respect to matters adjudicated which are of general and public interest . 50 C.J.S. Judgments s 796, p. 337; cf. Edelstein v. Asbury Park, 51 N.J.Super. 368, 389, 143 A.2d 860 (App.Div.1958); see also 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed. 1950), s 52.50, pp. 124, 125; 52 Am.Jur., Taxpayers' Actions, s 38, p. 26. [38] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Hence, it is to no avail that petitioners invoke lack of identity of parties.\u00a0 For petitioners in the first set of cases and in the instant case are suing under a common or general interest on a subject matter in a representative capacity, for the benefit of all taxpayers as a class.\u00a0 As this Court has repeatedly ruled, identity of parties needed to satisfy the requirement in lis pendens or res judicata requires only an identity of interest, not a literal identity of parties. [39]\n\nAs regards identity of causes of action, petitioners do not deny that the first set of cases \u2013 the complaint filed in Manila and the petition for mandamus filed before the Court of Appeals \u2013 involves the same causes of action grounded on the same set of facts as that of the Amended Complaint filed by them.\u00a0 Indeed, the petition for mandamus essentially sought to review the Manila RTC order dismissing the first complaint.\u00a0 Petitioners\u2019 incorporation of an additional cause of action in their Amended Complaint filed before the Quezon City RTC, occasioned merely by subsequent events, does not absolve petitioners from forum shopping.\n\nAdditionally, petitioners violated the requirement to report to the courts the fact that a similar action had been filed or is already pending before the courts, regardless of who initiated such similar action.\u00a0 For Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court requires:\nSEC. 5. Certification against forum shopping. \u2013 The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.\n\nFailure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions.\u00a0 If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.\u00a0 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Granted that petitioners were initially unaware of the existence of the first set of cases, albeit their counsel was one of the petitioners therein, such fact was already brought to their attention during the hearing of their application for a temporary restraining order [40] conducted after the filing of their Complaint. \u00a0When petitioners subsequently filed their Amended Complaint, however, they failed to report the pendency of the petition for mandamus before the appellate court bearing on the dismissal by the Manila RTC of the complaint filed by the Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc.\u00a0\u00a0 Public respondent\u2019s dismissal of the Amended Complaint on the ground of forum shopping is thus in order.\n\nThis leaves it unnecessary to pass on the rest of the issues.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED .\n\nCosts against petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\nCarpio, J., no part, member of Govt. and mentioned on pages 2 & 3.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. \u00a0128, 160.\n\n[2] Id. at 129.\n\n[3] Id. at \u00a0230-231;\u00a0 Section 1, E.O. 55 as amended.\n\n[4] Id. at 231;\u00a0 Section 2, E.O. 55 as amended.\n\n[5] Id. at 132.\n\n[6] Now Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n[7] Rollo, p. 146.\n\n[8] The BNPP Committee shall be composed of the Secretary of Energy as Chairman, the Secretary of Finance as Vice-Chairman, and as members, the Secretary of Budget and Management, Secretary of Trade and Industry, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Solicitor General, President of the NPC and President of the Philippine National Oil Company \u00a0(Sec. 2, E.O.

SPOUSES JAIME REMOQUILLO AND LUZ REMOQUILLO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nPetitioners Heirs of Salvador Hermosilla, namely:\u00a0 Adelaida H. Dolleton, Ruben Hermosilla, Lolita H. de la Vega, Erlinda H. Inovio, [1] Celia [2] H. Vivit, Zenaida H. Achoy, Precilla [3] H. Limpiahoy, and Edgardo Hermosilla, assail the Court of Appeals\u2019 Decision [4] dated September 29, 2004 which reversed the trial court\u2019s decision in their favor and accordingly dismissed their complaint.\n\nSubject of the controversy is a 65-square meter portion of a lot located in Poblacion, San Pedro, Laguna.\n\nOn August 31, 1931, the Republic of the Philippines acquired through purchase the San Pedro Tunasan Homesite.\n\nApolinario Hermosilla (Apolinario), who was occupying a lot in San Pedro Tunasan Homesite until his death in 1964, caused the subdivision of the lot into two, Lot 12 with an area of 341 square meters, and Lot 19 with an area of 341 square meters of which the 65 square meters subject of this controversy form part .\n\nOn April 30, 1962, Apolinario executed a Deed of Assignment transferring possession of Lot 19 in favor of his grandson, herein respondent Jaime Remoquillo (Jaime).\u00a0 As the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) later found that Lot 19 was still available for disposition to qualified applicants, Jaime, being its actual occupant, applied for its acquisition before the LTA on May 10, 1963.\n\nOn July 8, 1963, Apolinario conveyed Lot 12 to his son Salvador Hermosilla (Salvador), Jaime\u2019s uncle.\n\nSalvador later filed an application to purchase Lot 12 which was awarded to him by the defunct Land Authority on December 16, 1971.\n\nOn February 10, 1972 , Jaime and his uncle Salvador forged a \u201cKasunduan ng Paglipat Ng Karapatan sa Isang Lagay na Lupang Solar\u201d (Kasunduan) whereby Jaime transferred ownership of the 65 square meters (the questioned property) in favor of Salvador .\n\nAfter Apolinario died, his daughter Angela Hermosilla filed a protest before the Land Authority, which became the National Housing Authority (NHA), [5] contending that as an heir of the deceased, she is also entitled to Lots 12 and 19. \u00a0By Resolution of June 10, 1981, the NHA dismissed the protest.\n\nThe NHA later awarded on March 16, 1986 Lot 19 to Jaime for which he and his wife were issued a title, Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-156296, on September 15, 1987 . [6]\n\nOn May 25, 1992, petitioners filed an action for Annulment of Title on the ground of fraud with damages against Jaime and his spouse, together with the Register of Deeds, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna, alleging that by virtue of the Kasunduan executed in 1972, Jaime had conveyed to his uncle Salvador the questioned property\u2013part of Lot 19 covered by TCT No. T-156296 which was issued in 1987.\n\nBy Decision [7] of May 11, 1999, the RTC of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna, Branch 25, found the Kasunduan a perfected contract of sale, there being a meeting of the minds upon an identified object and upon a specific price, and that ownership over the questioned property had already been transferred and delivered to Salvador.\n\nOn the alleged failure of consideration of the Kasunduan, the trial court held that the same did not render the contract void, but merely allowed an action for specific performance.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the trial court\u2019s Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring plaintiffs as co-owners of the 65 square meters of the 341 square meters covered by TCT T-156296, registered in the name of defendants.\u00a0 The Court hereby directs the Register of Deeds of Laguna, Calamba Branch, to cancel said Transfer Certificate of Title, and in lieu thereof, to issue another [to] plaintiffs [as] co-owners of the above portion.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8] (Underscoring supplied) The Court of Appeals, reversing the decision of the trial court, held that the Kasunduan was void because at the time of its execution in 1972, the Republic of the Philippines was still the owner of Lot 19, hence, no right thereover was transmitted by Jaime who was awarded the Lot in 1986, and consequently no right was transmitted by Salvador through succession to petitioners.\u00a0 And it found no evidence of fraud in Jaime\u2019s act of having Lot 19, including the questioned property, registered in his and his wife\u2019s name in 1987.\n\nAt all events, the appellate court held that the action had prescribed, it having been filed in 1992, more than four years from the issuance to Jaime and his wife of the Transfer Certificate of Title.\n\nHence, the present petition for review on certiorari.\n\nPetitioners argue that the application of the law on prescription would perpetrate fraud and spawn injustice, they citing Cometa v. Court of Appeals ; [9] and that at any rate, prescription does not lie against a co-owner. Cometa involves a different factual milieu concerning the right of redemption, however.\u00a0 And petitioners\u2019 contention that prescription does not lie against a co-owner fails because only the title covering the questioned property, which petitioners claim to solely own, is being assailed.\n\nWhile this Court finds that the action is, contrary to the appellate court\u2019s ruling, not barred by the statute of limitations, it is still dismissible as discussed below.\n\nAlbeit captioned as one for Annulment of Title, the Complaint ultimately seeks the reconveyance of the property.\n\nFrom the allegations of the Complaint, petitioners seek the reconveyance of the property based on implied trust.\u00a0 The prescriptive period for the reconveyance of fraudulently registered real property is 10 years , reckoned from the date of the issuance of the certificate of title, [10] if the plaintiff is not in possession , but imprescriptible if he is in possession of the property.\nAn action for reconveyance based on an implied trust prescribes in ten years. The ten-year prescriptive period applies only if there is an actual need to reconvey the property as when the plaintiff is not in possession of the property .\u00a0 However, if the plaintiff, as the real owner of the property also remains in possession of the property, the prescriptive period to recover the title and possession of the property does not run against him. In such a case, an action for reconveyance, if nonetheless filed , would be in the nature of a suit for quieting of title, an action that is imprescriptible . [11] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) It is undisputed that petitioners\u2019 houses occupy the questioned property and that respondents have not been in possession thereof. [12] Since there was no actual need to reconvey the property as petitioners remained in possession thereof, the action took the nature of a suit for quieting of title, it having been filed to enforce an alleged implied trust after Jaime refused to segregate title over Lot 19.\u00a0 One who is in actual possession of a piece of land claiming to be the owner thereof may wait until his possession is disturbed or his title is attacked before taking steps to vindicate his right. [13] From the body of the complaint, this type of action denotes imprescriptibility.\n\nAs priorly stated, however, when the Kasunduan was executed in 1972 by Jaime in favor of Salvador \u2013 petitioners\u2019 predecessor-in-interest \u2013 Lot 19, of which the questioned property forms part, was still owned by the Republic. Nemo dat quod non habet . [14] Nobody can give what he does not possess.\u00a0 Jaime could not thus have transferred anything to Salvador via the Kasunduan .\n\nClaiming exception to the rule, petitioners posit that at the time the Kasunduan was executed by Jaime in 1972, his application which was filed in 1963 for the award to him of Lot 19 was still pending, hence, the Kasunduan transferred to Salvador Jaime\u2019s vested right to purchase the same, in support of which they cite a law on estoppel, Art. 1434 of the Civil Code, which provides that \u201c[w]hen a person who is not the owner of a thing sells or alienates and delivers it and later, the seller or grantor acquires title thereto, such title passes by operation of law to the buyer or grantee.\u201d [15]\n\nPetitioners\u2019 reliance on Article 1434 of the Civil Code does not lie.\u00a0 The principles of estoppel apply insofar as they are not in conflict with the provisions of the Civil Code, the Code of Commerce, the Rules of Court and special laws . [16]\n\nLand Authority Administrative Order No. 4 (1967), \u201cRules and Regulations governing Disposition of the Laguna Settlement Project in San Pedro, Laguna,\u201d proscribes the conveyance of the privilege or preference to purchase a land from the San Pedro Tunasan project before it is awarded to a tenant or bona fide occupant, thus:\nSEC. 6. Privilege of Preference to Purchase Intransferable; \u00a0Waiver or Forfeiture Thereof. \u2013 \u00a0From the date of acquisition of the estate by the Government and before issuance of the Order of Award , no tenant or bona fide occupant in whose favor the land may be sold shall transfer or encumber the privilege or preference to purchase the land , and any transfer or encumbrance made in violation hereof shall be null and void : Provided, however, That such privilege or preference may be waived or forfeited only in favor of the Land Authority . . . [17] (Italics in the original, emphasis and underscoring supplied) Petitioners\u2019 insistence on any right to the property under the Kasunduan thus fails.\n[T]he transfer \u201cbecame one in violation of law (the rules of the PHHC being promulgated in pursuance of law have the force of law) and therefore void ab initio .\u201d\u00a0 Hence, appellant acquired no right over the lot from a contract void ab initio, no rights are created. Estoppel, as postulated by petitioner, will not apply for it cannot be predicated on an illegal act.\u00a0 It is generally considered that as between the parties to a contract, validity cannot be given to it by estoppel if it is prohibited by law or is against public policy . [18] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Petitioners go on to postulate that if the Kasunduan is void, it follows that the 1962 Deed of Assignment executed by Apolinario in favor of Jaime is likewise void to thus deprive the latter of any legal basis for his occupation and acquisition of Lot 19.\n\nPetitioners\u2019 position fails.\u00a0\u00a0 Petitioners lose sight of the fact that, as reflected above, Jaime acquired Lot 19 in his own right, independently of the Deed of Assignment.\n\nIn another vein, since the property was previously a public land, petitioners have no personality to impute fraud or misrepresentation against the State or violation of the law. [19] If the title was in fact fraudulently obtained, it is the State which should file the suit to recover the property through the Office of the Solicitor General.\u00a0 The title originated from a grant by the government, hence, its cancellation is a matter between the grantor and the grantee. [20]\n\nAt all events, for an action for reconveyance based on fraud to prosper, the plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence not only his title to the property but also the fact of fraud.\u00a0 Fraud is never presumed.\u00a0 Intentional acts to deceive and deprive another of his right, or in some manner injure him must be specifically alleged and proved by the plaintiff by clear and convincing evidence. [21] Petitioners failed to discharge this burden, however.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is, in light of the foregoing ratiocination, DENIED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr. JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Erlinda H.

Such functions were later assigned to the Land Authority under Republic Act No. 3844 (August 8, 1963).\u00a0 The Department (later, Ministry) of Agrarian Reform became the successor of the Land Authority, before the National Housing Authority assumed such functions by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 757 (July 31, 1975).\n\n[6] Rollo , pp. 33-34.\n\n[7] Penned by Judge Hilario F.

NO. 174280, January 30, 2007 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. RAYMOND BATIANCILA Y MORALDE, APPELLANT.\nDECISION\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. RAYMOND BATIANCILA Y MORALDE, APPELLANT.\n\nDECISION\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.\n\nFor review is the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 00838, which affirmed in toto the March 3, 2004 Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (RTC-QC), Branch 86 in Criminal Case No. Q-02-110479, finding Raymond Batiancila y Moralde guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\n\nOn June 30, 2002, then 12-year-old private complainant XYZ [3] was alone in their house in Quezon City when appellant Raymond Batiancila, known to her as \u201cKuya Bonbon,\u201d came by to watch television. After an hour, appellant summoned XYZ to go inside her mother\u2019s bedroom. Once inside, he suddenly held XYZ\u2019s hands above her head, pushed her against the wall, and began to undress her. XYZ tried to resist, but appellant threatened to kill her and her mother. Appellant then proceeded to remove his pants and briefs, inserted his penis into her vagina, and had sexual intercourse with her while standing up.\n\nAfter the sexual intercourse, XYZ went to the house of her relative, AAA, and narrated what Batiancila did to her. Thereafter, XYZ\u2019s mother and aunt brought her to the police who referred them to Camp Crame for medical examination.\n\nP/Sr. Inspector Filemon C. Portciuncula, a medico-legal officer at the PNP Crime Laboratory examined XYZ at about 10:20 p.m. of June 30, 2002; [4] the pertinent portion of his initial report reads:\nFINDINGS: Genital: Hymen with presence of shallow flesh bleeding laceration at 4 o\u2019clock and deep fresh bleeding laceration at 6 o\u2019clock positions. Posterior fourchette is congested.\n\nCONCLUSION: Findings are compatible with recent loss of virginity. There are no external signs of application of any form of trauma. [5] That same night, Batiancila was arrested and brought to the precinct for investigation. At the police station, he asked forgiveness from BBB, the mother of the victim. [6]\n\nOn July 1, 2002, Batiancila was charged with Rape, in relation to Section 5(a), Art. III of Republic Act No. 7610, [7] in an Information [8] that reads:\nThat on or about the 30 th day of June, 2002 in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, with lewd design with force and intimidation did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of sexual abuse upon the person of XYZ, a minor, 12 years old, have carnal knowledge with her against her will and without her consent, which act debase degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of said XYZ as a human being, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [9] Batiancila pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. [10]\n\nIn due course, the trial court rendered judgment convicting Batiancila thus:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Raymond Battiancila y Moralde [sic] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to pay the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, plus moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00, plus costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11] In view of the penalty imposed, the case was elevated to this Court for automatic review. However, pursuant to our ruling in People v. Mateo , [12] the case was transferred to the Court of Appeals which rendered the assailed Decision dated January 31, 2006, affirming the trial court in toto ; hence, the instant appeal. [13]\n\nAppellant prays for his acquittal based on reasonable doubt. He avers that there was no evidence of his alleged use of irresistible force and serious intimidation as he had no weapon to threaten XYZ with during the afternoon of the alleged rape, and that there was no evidence showing the resistance of XYZ as there were no torn clothes to prove any struggle between the two of them. These, according to Batiancila, show that XYZ actually had consensual intercourse with him for they were then sweethearts. [14]\n\nThe appeal is bereft of merit.\n\nIt is worthy to recall the three guiding principles in rape prosecutions. First, an accusation for rape is easy to make, difficult to prove, and even more difficult to disprove. Second, in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with utmost caution. Third, the evidence of the prosecution must stand on its own merits and can not draw strength from the weakness of the defense. [15]\n\nWhen a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity. [16] Also, in a long line of cases, we have held that if the testimony of the rape victim is accurate and credible, a conviction for rape may issue upon the sole basis of the victim\u2019s testimony because no decent and sensible woman will publicly admit being a rape victim and thus run the risk of public contempt unless she is, in fact, a rape victim. [17]\n\nIn the instant case, we agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that XYZ\u2019s narration of her ordeal was clear, straightforward, and sincere; thus giving no reason to suspect the truthfulness of her testimony. XYZ candidly identified her rapist, [18] vividly depicted the abhorrent acts done to her, and described the threats made by the accused:\nOn direct testimony \u2013\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said you entered the room, so what happened when you entered the room?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He undressed me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who is this \u201che\u201d that you are referring to?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kuya Bonbon.\n\nx x x x\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he undressed you, what happened next?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He held my hand.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How did he hold your hand?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He raised my hand.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you show us how he did this, how he raised your hand?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Witness demonstrating by raising both hands crossed on the wrist (sic), raised up to the head.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it only up to the head?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He still raised it a little higher.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you try to resist when he held your hands?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why did you do this?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I can escape.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Were you able to escape?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No Ma\u2019am.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why were you not able to escape?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was already afraid.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why were you scared, XYZ?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because of what he said.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did he say?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That he will kill me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you believe him when he said that?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So you said that he held your hads (sic) above your head and you were not able to escape, what happened after that?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He removed my pants.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then what happened?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He removed also my panty.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What happened after that?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He removed his pants.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then what happened after that?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He also removed his brief (sic).\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What happened after that?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He inserted his private part to my private part.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did he say anything during the time he did it?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did he say?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That I shall not report.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did he (sic) say anything?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None, Ma\u2019am.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why did you not say anything?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was very afraid.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you believe him when he said that he will kill you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After it happened, what did he do?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He left the room.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did you do after what happened?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I went to the comfort room.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then what happened after that?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I went to AAA.

[20] Indeed, the assignment of values to the testimony of a witness is virtually left, almost entirely, to the trial court which has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness at the stand. Unless there are substantial matters that might have been overlooked or discarded, the findings of credibility by the trial court will not generally be disturbed on appeal. [21] In the instant case, we find nothing in the records which warrants a departure from the findings of the trial court.\n\nIt is of no moment that Batiancila was not armed when he raped XYZ. The force, violence, or intimidation in rape is a relative term, depending not only on the age, size, and strength of the parties but also on their relationship with each other. [22] Records show that XYZ was only 12 years old when she was raped by Batiancila who was 21 years old. Understandably, a girl of such young age could only cower in fear and yield into submission to such an adult, more especially so as he is her cousin who has moral ascendancy over her. Rape, after all, is nothing more than a conscious process of intimidation by which a man keeps a woman in a state of fear and humiliation. Thus, it is not even impossible for a victim of rape not to make an outcry against an unarmed assailant. [23]\n\nIt is also well settled that physical resistance need not be established in rape when intimidation is exercised upon the victim and the latter submits herself against her will to the rapist\u2019s advances because of fear for her life and personal safety. [24] Besides, physical resistance is not the sole test to determine whether a woman involuntarily succumbed to the lust of an accused. Rape victims show no uniform reaction. Some may offer strong resistance while others may be too intimidated to offer any resistance at all. [25] Thus, the law does not impose a burden on the rape victim to prove resistance. What needs only to be proved by the prosecution is the use of force or intimidation by the accused in having sexual intercourse with the victim. [26]\n\nAppellant insists that he and XYZ were lovers and that the intercourse was consensual. He recounts that on June 30, 2002, XYZ willingly raised her hands so as to facilitate the consummation of their sexual congress. Moreover, he claims that he and XYZ consummated the sexual act while standing because they enjoy the thrill and pleasure of such position.\n\nWe find these claims unbelievable and unworthy of credence. XYZ was only 12 years old at the time of the rape and was inexperienced in the ways of the world. In fact, the medical examination revealed that she was a virgin prior to the rape. All these indicate that XYZ could not have known the sexual know-how or have sexual preferences as imputed by Batiancila.\n\nWe also agree with the trial court that the \u201csweetheart story\u201d was a mere concoction of Batiancila in order to exculpate himself from criminal liability. Defense witness Jojo Magallanes claims that he learned that Batiancila and XYZ were already sweethearts months prior to the rape; thus he was not surprised when he saw XYZ sitting on the lap of Batiancila on June 30, 2002. [27] However, the rest of Magallanes\u2019 testimony contained a lot of inconsistencies as to important facts, [28] thus reflecting negatively on his credibility and biased motives.\n\nAside from Batiancila\u2019s claim and Magallanes\u2019 unreliable testimony, no other convincing evidence substantiated the alleged romantic relationship between the former and XYZ. In People v. Venerable , [29] we held that the sweetheart theory of the accused was unavailing and self-serving where he failed to introduce love letters, gifts, and the like to attest to his alleged amorous affair with the victim. [30] The defense cannot just present testimonial evidence in support of the theory that the accused and the victim were sweethearts; independent proof is necessary, such as tokens, mementos, and photographs. [31]\n\nThis Court is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crime of rape by having carnal knowledge of XYZ using force and intimidation; thus the trial court properly imposed upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua . [32]\n\nAnent the award of damages, the trial court correctly awarded P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages. Civil indemnity is in the nature of actual and compensatory damages, and is obligatory upon conviction of rape. As to moral damages, it is automatically awarded to rape victims without the necessity of proof, for it is assumed that she suffered moral injuries entitling her to such award. This award is separate and distinct from civil indemnity. [33]\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 00838 affirming the judgment of Branch 86, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in Criminal Case No. Q-02-110479, finding Raymond Batiancila y Moralde guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and ordering him to pay the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages is AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nAustria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 3-17; penned by Associate Justice Fernanda Lampas Peralta and concurred in by Associate Justices Josefina Guevara-Salonga and Sesinando E.

      "title": "The complainants filed a Second Supplemental Complaint on April 30, 2004, reiterating the charges against the respondent Judge. They also filed a motion to withdraw their previous prayer for inhibition.In a Resolution dated August 11, 2004, the Court resolved to refer the matter to Court of Appeals Associate Justice Remedios A. Salazar-Fernando for investigation, report and recommendation.In her Final Report and Recommendation dated November 8, 2004, the Investigating Justice found that based on the records, the respondent Judge was not remiss in her duties relative to Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505, thus:On August 2, 2000, respondent Judge appointed Julita Campos Benedicto as administratrix of the estate of the deceased Roberto S. Benedicto [Records, Vol. I, p. 13]. Upon filing of the bond in the amount of five million (P5,000,000) pesos, [letters] of administration [were] issued in favor of the administratrix and [a] notice dated August 23, 2000 to file money claims against the decedent was ordered published.Under Section 1, Rule 83 of the Revised Rules of Court, the administratrix should return/file with the court a true inventory and appraisal of all the real and personal estate of the deceased which came to her possession or knowledge.On December 12, 2000, the administratrix filed a motion for extension of time to file an Inventory on the ground that she was in the process of gathering documents and data necessary for the preparation of an inventory which were made difficult because of the very personalized way the deceased had been recording his assets and conducting his business affairs.On December 13, 2000, the motion for extension of item was granted.On January 12, 2001, the administratrix filed another extension of fifteen (15) days from January 15, 2001 within which to file an inventory which could not be finalized due to lack of necessary data such as the probable value of some specific assets. The motion was granted by respondent Judge.The Inventory was submitted on January 19, 2001, which placed the estate\u2019s value at P36,799,822.25. Accordingly, respondent Judge ordered the payment of additional filing fee based on the declared value of the estate [Ibid, p. 58].After finding that the initial inventory had no appraisal on March 26, 2001, respondent Judge directed the administratrix to submit the completed and updated inventory and appraisal report. Additional bond was also ordered to be posted [Ibid, p. 60].The administratrix asked for an extension of time or until May 31, 2001 to file an updated inventory [Ibid, p. 63]. The same was granted on April 24, 2001 [Ibid, p. 67].On the preceding facts alone, it could be gleaned that respondent Judge dutifully fulfilled her responsibility in exacting from the administratrix the observance of her responsibilities. Please note that those were not the only actions taken by the respondent Judge. Records of the case show that respondent Judge issued several Orders resolving other motions.Complainants fault respondent Judge for failing to order the administratrix to file a completed and updated inventory even as late as the date of this Complaint.In the [administratrix\u2019s] motion for extension of time, she stated that the Inventory was complete except for the valuation of some shares of stock and to obtain the same, full auditing of the entire corporation complete with the actual field verification of recorded cases was needed. The same appears to be meritorious considering the vast estate of the deceased.When the administratrix did not submit the updated inventory after the deadline on May 31, 2001, respondent Judge on October 16, 2003, directed the administratrix to file the updated inventory. For which reason, administratrix filed another two (2) motions for extension of time to file the same.\u2026The delay in the submission of the inventory was aptly explained by the motions for extension of time filed by the administratrix.The above ruling went on to expound that the administrator\u2019s unexplained delay in filing the inventory may be a ground for his removal. Hence, the judge may not be faulted for the [administratrix\u2019s] delay. However, only the heirs or beneficiaries of the estate may move for the removal of the administratrix on the grounds provided for in Rule 82.Likewise, the failure to render an account is a ground for the removal of the administratrix by the proper parties.The mandatory character of the requirement of an account or accounting one (1) year from the time of receiving letters testamentary or of administration admits of exception, i.e., when the Court, otherwise, directs.\u2026In this case, the one-year mandatory period within which to render an accounting should be reckoned from December 16, 2003. Hence, accounting of the estate is not yet due.[10]However, the Investigating Justice opined that the respondent Judge arbitrarily denied the complainants access to the case records of Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505 by refusing requests for photocopying of the same, and made the following conclusion and recommendation:This Investigator concludes that respondent Judge is not guilty of inaction or failure to require observance of the Rules by the Administratrix.However, respondent Judge\u2019s refusal to give the complainants access to the case records of SP-97505 is arbitrary. The right to information on matters of public concern is a constitutional right. Access to official records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is hereby recommended that respondent Judge be adjudged guilty of dereliction of duty and improper conduct bordering on oppression and accordingly be CENSURED, REPRIMANDED and WARNED that a repetition of the same in the future will be dealt with more severely.[11]The findings and recommendation of Justice Salazar-Fernando are well taken.The Court holds that the respondent Judge erred in denying the complainants access to the court records of Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505. Admittedly, the complainants could not demand that they be furnished with the court\u2019s orders and the pleadings filed by the parties, in as much as the respondent Judge had already ruled that they were not parties-in-interest. However, the Court finds that the respondent Judge should not have prohibited the complainants from going over the records of the case and securing copies of pertinent orders and pleadings.[12]Courts in the United States have recognized the general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.[13] In our jurisdiction, the right is enshrined in Section 7, Article III of the Constitution, which provides:Sec. 7. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.The reliance of the respondent Judge on the ruling of the Court in Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission,[14] to justify the denial of access to court records is misplaced. On the contrary, the following pronouncement in the said case further bolsters the claim of the complainants:In determining whether or not a particular information is of public concern there is no rigid test which can be applied. \u201cPublic concern,\u201d like public interest, is a term that eludes exact definition. Both terms embrace a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these directly affect their lives, or simply because such matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen. In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine in a case by case basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it relates to or affects the public.[15]The presumption that the public has a right to see and copy judicial records attaches to those documents which properly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to the adjudication.[16] Hence, relevant documents which are submitted to, and accepted by, a court of competent jurisdiction in the course of adjudicatory proceedings, become documents to which the presumption of public access applies.[17] The policy reasons for granting public access to criminal proceedings include the public\u2019s right to monitor the functioning of our courts, thereby ensuring quality, honesty and respect for our legal system. Such policy reasons apply to the grant of public access to civil cases as well.[18]The importance of access to public records, court records more particularly, was explained in Lantaco, Sr. v. Llamas,[19] where the respondent Judge therein refused to furnish the complainants a copy of his decision. According to the Court, the importance of this right to access to court records is predicated on the right of the people to acquire information on matters of public concern in which the public has a legitimate interest. It was further explained that while the public officers in custody of control of public records have the discretion to regulate the manner in which such records may be inspected, examined or copied by interested persons, such discretion does not carry with it the authority to prohibit such access, inspection, examination or copying. To drive home the point, the Court cited its pronouncement in Baldoza v. Dimaano,[20] to wit:\u2026 The incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a recognition of the fundamental role of free exchange of information in a democracy. There can be no realistic perception by the public of the nation\u2019s problems, nor a meaningful democratic decision-making if they are denied access to information of general interest. Information is needed to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of the times. As has been aptly observed: \u201cMaintaining the flow of such information depends on protection for both its acquisition and its dissemination since, if either process is interrupted, the flow inevitably ceases.\u201d However, restrictions on access to certain records may be imposed by law. Thus, access restrictions imposed to control civil insurrection have been permitted upon a showing of immediate and impending danger that renders ordinary means of control inadequate to maintain order.[21]We agree with the following ratiocination of the Investigating Justice:However, the constitutional guarantee to information on matters of public concern is not absolute. Under the Constitution, access to official records, papers, etc., are \u201csubject to limitations as may be provided by law.\u201d Therefore, a law may exempt certain types of information from public scrutiny such as matters on national security. Otherwise stated, the availability of access to a particular public record must be restricted by the nature of the information sought, i.e., (a) of public concern or one that involves public interest, and (b) not being exempted by law from the operation of the constitutional guarantee.The privilege against disclosure is recognized with respect to state secrets bearing on military, diplomatic and similar matters. This privilege is based upon public interest of such paramount importance which transcends the individual interests of a private citizen, even though, as a consequence thereof, the plaintiff cannot enforce his legal rights.SP No. 97505 does not contain any military or diplomatic secret which will be disclosed by its production. Neither is there any law or regulation which considers the case records as classified information.The right to information is subject to reasonable regulations and restrictions. However, while public officers in custody or control of public records have the discretion to regulate the manner in which such records may be inspected, examined or copied by interested persons, such discretion does not carry with it the authority to prohibit such access, inspection, examination or copying.[22]The Court thus rules that for denying the complainants access to court records, the respondent Judge must be reprimanded.The respondent Judge cannot be similarly chastised for ruling that the complainants were not parties-in-interest in the subject case. It is settled that as a matter of policy, the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. He cannot be subjected to liability \u2013 civil, criminal or administrative \u2013 for any of his official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as he acts in good faith.[23] Only judicial errors tainted with fraud, dishonesty, gross ignorance, bad faith or deliberate intent to do an injustice will be administratively sanctioned.[24] To hold, otherwise, would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment.[25] Indeed, an administrative complaint against a judge cannot be pursued simultaneously with the judicial remedies accorded to parties aggrieved by his erroneous order or judgment. Administrative remedies are neither alternative nor cumulative to judicial review where such review is available to the aggrieved parties and the same has not yet been resolved with finality. For until there is a final declaration by the appellate court that the challenged order or judgment is manifestly erroneous, there will be no basis to conclude whether respondent judge is administratively liable.[26]Thus, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not to file an administrative complaint against the judge, but to elevate the assailed decision or order to the higher court for review and correction,[27] which in this case the complainants have already done. The Court notes that in a Decision dated February 27, 2004, the CA dismissed the petition questioning the ruling of the respondent Judge that the complainants were not parties-in-interest in Sp. Proc. 00-97505, and that the complainants elevated such dismissal to this Court via a petition for review.It must be stressed that an administrative complaint is not an appropriate remedy where judicial recourse is still available, such as a motion for reconsideration, an appeal, or a petition for certiorari, unless the assailed order or decision is tainted with fraud, malice, or dishonesty.[28] The Court has to be shown acts or conduct of the judge clearly indicative of arbitrariness or prejudice before the latter can be branded the stigma of being biased and partial. Good faith and absence of malice, corrupt motives or improper considerations, are sufficient defenses in which a judge charged with ignorance of the law can find refuge.[29] In this case, no bad faith can be attributed to the respondent Judge for relying on the ruling of this Court in Lantaco v. Llamas,[30] albeit erroneously.WHEREFORE, for denying the complainants access to court records, respondent Judge Amor A. Reyes is hereby REPRIMANDED. She is sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely.SO ORDERED.Puno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Tinga, and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.[1] Rollo, pp. 12-29.[2] Id. at 32-34.[3] Id. at 36-46.[4] Id. at 15.[5] Id. at 18-19.[6] Id. at 75-78.[7] The complainants filed an Omnibus Motion dated October 8, 2001 (Rollo, pp. 79-83) praying, among others, that the respondent Judge set a deadline for the submission of a verified and complete inventory of the estate of the decedent, as well as to order the Administratrix to submit a verified annual account and her subsequent examination under oath with respect thereto.

REYES REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH 21, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nALFREDO HILADO, LOPEZ SUGAR CORPORATION AND FIRST FARMERS HOLDING CORPORATION, COMPLAINANTS, VS. JUDGE AMOR A. REYES REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH 21, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nThe instant administrative matter arose when Alfredo Hilado, Lopez Sugar Corporation and First Farmers Holding Corporation filed a verified Complaint [1] dated November 17, 2003 charging Judge Amor A. Reyes, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 21, with gross ignorance of the law, gross inefficiency, dereliction of duty, serious misconduct, partiality and violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct relative to Special Proceedings No. 00-97505 for issuance of letters of administration entitled \u201c Intestate Estate of Roberto S. Benedicto .\u201d\n\nComplainant Alfredo Hilado is the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 95-9137 entitled \u201c Manuel Lacson, et al. v. Roberto Benedicto, et al. ,\u201d filed before the RTC of Bacolod City, Branch 44, while complainants Lopez Sugar Corporation and First Farmers Holding Corporation are the lead plaintiffs/intervenors in Civil Case No. 11178 pending before the RTC of Bacolod City, Branch 41.\u00a0 Upon the death of Roberto Benedicto in May 2000, he was substituted by his estate in the aforementioned civil cases.\n\nSpecial Proceedings No. 00-97505 was raffled to the sala of the respondent Judge. She, thereafter, appointed Julita Campos Benedicto as the administratrix of the estate in an Order [2] dated August 2, 2000, and letters of administration were, thereafter, issued in favor of the latter.\u00a0 According to the complainants, the appointed administratrix acknowledged their claims against the estate of the deceased as major liabilities thereof in an Inventory [3] dated January 18, 2001.\u00a0 The complainants further alleged, thus:\nShortly prior to September 2001, Complainants uncovered serious lapses in the observance and enforcement by Respondent Judge of the mandatory prescriptions of the Rules governing the administration of the estate and in collation and preservation of its assets.\n\nAmong others, Petitioners discovered that while the Respondent Administratrix had been issued Letters of Administration as early as August 2, 2000 and had been granted by the Respondent Court, in an Order dated April 24, 2001, [a] final extended period until May 31, 2001 for the submission of \u201ca completed and updated inventory and appraisal report ,\u201d what had been submitted was still an unverified, incomplete and unappraised inventory dated January 18, 2001.\u00a0 Worse, in submitting the practically worthless inventory, Respondent Administratrix declined to vouch for the accuracy of the same, \u2026\n\n\u2026\n\nLikewise, it was discovered by Complainants that despite the lapse of over a year since the issuance of her letters of administration, the Administratrix had failed to render an annual account of her administration as mandatorily required by Section 8 of Rule 85. [4]\nThe complainants further alleged that the respondent Judge had, likewise, approved the sale of substantial and valuable assets of the estate without serving notice to them and other persons interested, in violation of Section 7, Rule 89 of the Rules of Court.\u00a0 Despite this, the respondent Judge failed to issue any order directing the administratrix to comply with the rules.\u00a0 The records of the intestate estate proceedings furthermore revealed a deliberate design to prejudice and preclude the opportune participation of the complainants.\u00a0 Thus:\n9.1 Under Section 2 of Rule 79, the application for letters of administration is required to state, among others, \u201cthe names, ages and residences of the heirs, and the names and residences of the creditors, of the decedent \u201d \u201cso far as known to the petitioner.\u201d However, although the Petition for Letters of Administration filed by the Administratrix acknowledged the existence of liabilities, and the List of Liabilities submitted with her inventory named the Complainants together with the Bureau of Internal Revenue as the major creditors of the estate, Administratrix did not name and list Complainants as creditors of the decedent in her Petition.\u00a0 In fact, no creditor was named at all.\n\n9.2 Pursuant to Section 5 of the same Rule 79, letters of administration may be validly issued only after it is \u201cfirst shown that notice has been given as \u2026 required\u201d by Section 3 of the same rule, that is to say, notice \u201cto the known heirs and creditors of the decedent and to any other persons believed to have an interest in the estate ,\u201d given not only via publication but also by mail \u201caddressed [to them] \u2026 at their places of residence, and deposited at least twenty (20) days before the hearing\u201d or by \u201cpersonal service \u2026 at least ten (10) days before the days of hearing \u2026\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, no notice of whatever kind was served on Complainants.\n\n9.3 Significantly, the Purchase and Sale Agreement disposing of the assets of Traders Royal Bank, which the Respondent Judge approved without notice to Complainants, explicitly, categorically and discriminatorily excluded, from the liabilities to be assumed by the Bank of Commerce as Purchaser, Petitioners\u2019 claims in the pending Bacolod suits against TRB and the estate, claims which had previously been acknowledged in the [Administratrix\u2019s] Inventory as major liabilities of the estate. [5]\nIn light of these discoveries, the complainants, through counsel, filed a Manifestation/Motion Ex Abudanti Cautela [6] dated September 24, 2001 identifying themselves as among the major creditors in the inventory prepared by the appointed administratrix, and prayed that the Branch Clerk of Court be required to furnish the petitioners, through their counsel, copies of all the processes and orders issued by the court, and to require the administratrix to serve copies of all the proceedings to their counsel.\u00a0 Pending the resolution of this motion, the complainants also filed urgent pleadings bringing to the attention of the respondent Judge her procedural lapses. [7] However, the respondent Judge issued an Order [8] dated January 2, 2002 refusing to recognize the complainants as interested parties entitled to participate and intervene in the proceedings. This compelled the complainants to file a motion for reconsideration of the said order, which was, likewise, denied by the respondent Judge.\n\nAccording to the complainants, the respondent Judge failed to consider the fact that no less than the appointed administratrix recognized their claims as major liabilities of the estate.\u00a0 They further claimed that the respondent Judge\u2019s action only shows that there was a deliberate design to preclude their participation in the intestate proceedings.\u00a0 The complainants further alleged that a probate judge, such as the respondent, should know the \u201celementary doctrines\u201d regarding the settlement of estates, failing which he may be held guilty of ignorance of the law.\u00a0 The complainants averred that it is a well settled judicial policy to favor the liberal participation of all parties having an interest, however minimal, in the proper settlement of the estate of the deceased.\u00a0 Hence, the respondent Judge\u2019s failure to apply and observe the elementary doctrines bearing on the settlement of estate which are presumed to be known to a probate court reflects inexcusable ignorance of the law.\n\nAside from praying that the appropriate disciplinary sanction to be meted on the respondent Judge, the complainants also prayed that the respondent Judge be disqualified from further trying Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505.\u00a0 They, likewise, prayed that the said proceedings be forwarded to the Executive Judge of the RTC of Manila for re-raffle to another sala .\n\nFor her part, the respondent Judge explained that prior to her Order dated January 2, 2002, the complainants, through counsel, filed a motion with a prayer that an order be issued requiring the Branch Clerk of Court to furnish them (complainants) with copies of all processes and orders, and to require the administratrix to serve them copies of all pleadings in the proceedings.\u00a0 In her Order dated January 2, 2002, the respondent Judge declared that under the Rules, the complainants were without personality to participate in the intestate proceedings, thus, cannot intervene therein, much less be furnished with copies of orders, pleadings and processes relative thereto.\u00a0 The complainants filed a motion for reconsideration, which she denied on March 12, 2002.\u00a0 The respondent Judge pointed out that her ruling was elevated to the Court of Appeals (CA) via a petition for certiorari .\n\nOn the complainants\u2019 contention that she failed in her responsibility towards the appointed administratrix of the estate, the respondent Judge explained that the latter had already filed an initial inventory less than a year after the issuance of the letters of administration and that the administratrix was still in the process of preparing the supplemental inventory.\u00a0 Nonetheless, the respondent Judge issued an Order dated October 16, 2003 directing the administratrix to submit an updated inventory within thirty (30) days from receipt of the said Order.\u00a0 The administratrix filed a motion for extension as she had been continuously working on the preparation of the inventory of the estate and the delay was due to the difficulties of verifying the decedents\u2019 stock investments.\u00a0 The motion for extension filed by the administratrix was granted by the court on November 26, 2003.\n\nThe respondent Judge contended that the complaint was baseless, malicious and was intended to harass her, and was filed in retaliation for her unfavorable rulings against the complainants.\u00a0 She further contended that she resolved the motions filed by the complainants according to her own judgment and understanding of the law and the attendant circumstances.\u00a0 The respondent Judge, therefore, prayed for the dismissal of the case for lack of merit.\n\nThe complainants filed a Supplemental Complaint on February 6, 2004 contending that the respondent Judge had not yet required the administratrix of the estate to submit an inventory and annual account despite the lapse of time under the rules.\u00a0 They also claimed that they were again denied participation in the proceedings of the settlement of the estate, and access to the court records which are considered public.\u00a0 They prayed for the inhibition of the respondent Judge in trying Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505.\n\nIn the comment of the respondent Judge to the supplemental complaint, she maintained that the complainants were not considered parties-in-interest since their claims remain contingent on the outcome of the cases still pending in the RTC of Bacolod City.\u00a0 The respondent Judge also pointed out that the appeal of the complainants to her court order, declaring the latter as not parties-in-interest in the settlement of the estate of the decedent, was still pending consideration by the appellate court.\u00a0 Thus:\na) The law does not give blanket authority to any person to have access to official records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts.\u00a0 As worded, only matters of public concern may a person [be] accorded access. In the present case, complainants\u2019 interest is more of personal than of public concern. The ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Valentin L. Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission (G.R. No. 72119, May 29, 1987) is the case in point.\n\n\u201cBut the constitutional guarantee to information on matters of public concern is not absolute.\u00a0 It does not open every door to any and all information. Under the Constitution, access to official records, papers, etc., \u2018are subject to limitations as may be provided by law\u2019 (Art. III, Sec. 7, second sentence).\u00a0 xxx in every case, the availability of access to a particular public record must be circumscribed by the nature of the information sought, i.e., (a) being of public concern or one that involves public interest, and (b) not being exempted by law from the operation of the constitutional guarantee. The threshold question is, therefore, whether or not the information sought is of public interest or public concern . \u201d\n\nb) Although complainants assert that they have the right to information based on the cases cited in the Supplemental Complaint, it is further clarified by this respondent that the position taken by them is utterly different because the parties involved in the cited cases are complainants themselves while in the case at hand, they are not considered parties-in-interest, their claim being contingent as their case is still pending with the RTC, Branch 44, Bacolod; \u2026 [9]\nThe complainants filed a Second Supplemental Complaint on April 30, 2004, reiterating the charges against the respondent Judge.\u00a0 They also filed a motion to withdraw their previous prayer for inhibition.\n\nIn a Resolution dated August 11, 2004, the Court resolved to refer the matter to Court of Appeals Associate Justice Remedios A. Salazar-Fernando for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nIn her Final Report and Recommendation dated November 8, 2004, the Investigating Justice found that based on the records, the respondent Judge was not remiss in her duties relative to Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505, thus:\nOn August 2, 2000, respondent Judge appointed Julita Campos Benedicto as administratrix of the estate of the deceased Roberto S. Benedicto [Records, Vol. I, p. 13].\u00a0 Upon filing of the bond in the amount of five million (P5,000,000) pesos, [letters] of administration [were] issued in favor of the administratrix and [a] notice dated August 23, 2000 to file money claims against the decedent was ordered published.\n\nUnder Section 1, Rule 83 of the Revised Rules of Court, the administratrix should return/file with the court a true inventory and appraisal of all the real and personal estate of the deceased which came to her possession or knowledge.\n\nOn December 12, 2000, the administratrix filed a motion for extension of time to file an Inventory on the ground that she was in the process of gathering documents and data necessary for the preparation of an inventory which were made difficult because of the very personalized way the deceased had been recording his assets and conducting his business affairs.\n\nOn December 13, 2000, the motion for extension of item was granted.\n\nOn January 12, 2001, the administratrix filed another extension of fifteen (15) days from January 15, 2001 within which to file an inventory which could not be finalized due to lack of necessary data such as the probable value of some specific assets.\u00a0 The motion was granted by respondent Judge.\n\nThe Inventory was submitted on January 19, 2001, which placed the estate\u2019s value at P36,799,822.25. Accordingly, respondent Judge ordered the payment of additional filing fee based on the declared value of the estate [ Ibid , p. 58].\n\nAfter finding that the initial inventory had no appraisal on March 26, 2001, respondent Judge directed the administratrix to submit the completed and updated inventory and appraisal report.\u00a0 Additional bond was also ordered to be posted [ Ibid , p. 60].\n\nThe administratrix asked for an extension of time or until May 31, 2001 to file an updated inventory [ Ibid , p. 63].\u00a0 The same was granted on April 24, 2001 [ Ibid , p. 67].\n\nOn the preceding facts alone, it could be gleaned that respondent Judge dutifully fulfilled her responsibility in exacting from the administratrix the observance of her responsibilities.\u00a0 Please note that those were not the only actions taken by the respondent Judge.\u00a0 Records of the case show that respondent Judge issued several Orders resolving other motions.\n\nComplainants fault respondent Judge for failing to order the administratrix to file a completed and updated inventory even as late as the date of this Complaint.\n\nIn the [administratrix\u2019s] motion for extension of time, she stated that the Inventory was complete except for the valuation of some shares of stock and to obtain the same, full auditing of the entire corporation complete with the actual field verification of recorded cases was needed.\u00a0 The same appears to be meritorious considering the vast estate of the deceased.\n\nWhen the administratrix did not submit the updated inventory after the deadline on May 31, 2001, respondent Judge on October 16, 2003, directed the administratrix to file the updated inventory.\u00a0 For which reason, administratrix filed another two (2) motions for extension of time to file the same.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe delay in the submission of the inventory was aptly explained by the motions for extension of time filed by the administratrix.\n\nThe above ruling went on to expound that the administrator\u2019s unexplained delay in filing the inventory may be a ground for his removal.\u00a0 Hence, the judge may not be faulted for the [administratrix\u2019s] delay.\u00a0 However, only the heirs or beneficiaries of the estate may move for the removal of the administratrix on the grounds provided for in Rule 82.\n\nLikewise, the failure to render an account is a ground for the removal of the administratrix by the proper parties.\n\nThe mandatory character of the requirement of an account or accounting one (1) year from the time of receiving letters testamentary or of administration admits of exception, i.e. , when the Court, otherwise, directs.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn this case, the one-year mandatory period within which to render an accounting should be reckoned from December 16, 2003.\u00a0 Hence, accounting of the estate is not yet due. [10]\nHowever, the Investigating Justice opined that the respondent Judge arbitrarily denied the complainants access to the case records of Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505 by refusing requests for photocopying of the same, and made the following conclusion and recommendation:\nThis Investigator concludes that respondent Judge is not guilty of inaction or failure to require observance of the Rules by the Administratrix.\n\nHowever, respondent Judge\u2019s refusal to give the complainants access to the case records of SP-97505 is arbitrary.\u00a0 The right to information on matters of public concern is a constitutional right.\u00a0 Access to official records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.\n\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is hereby recommended that respondent Judge be adjudged guilty of dereliction of duty and improper conduct bordering on oppression and accordingly be CENSURED, REPRIMANDED and WARNED that a repetition of the same in the future will be dealt with more severely. [11]\nThe findings and recommendation of Justice Salazar-Fernando are well taken.\n\nThe Court holds that the respondent Judge erred in denying the complainants access to the court records of Sp. Proc. No. 00-97505.\u00a0 Admittedly, the complainants could not demand that they be furnished with the court\u2019s orders and the pleadings filed by the parties, in as much as the respondent Judge had already ruled that they were not parties-in-interest.\u00a0 However, the Court finds that the respondent Judge should not have prohibited the complainants from going over the records of the case and securing copies of pertinent orders and pleadings. [12]\n\nCourts in the United States have recognized the general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents. [13] In our jurisdiction, the right is enshrined in Section 7, Article III of the Constitution, which provides:\nSec. 7. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized.\u00a0 Access to official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.\nThe reliance of the respondent Judge on the ruling of the Court in Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission , [14] to justify the denial of access to court records is misplaced.\u00a0 On the contrary, the following pronouncement in the said case further bolsters the claim of the complainants:\nIn determining whether or not a particular information is of public concern there is no rigid test which can be applied.\u00a0 \u201cPublic concern,\u201d like public interest, is a term that eludes exact definition.\u00a0 Both terms embrace a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these directly affect their lives, or simply because such matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen.\u00a0 In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine in a case by case basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it relates to or affects the public. [15]\nThe presumption that the public has a right to see and copy judicial records attaches to those documents which properly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to the adjudication. [16] Hence, relevant documents which are submitted to, and accepted by, a court of competent jurisdiction in the course of adjudicatory proceedings, become documents to which the presumption of public access applies. [17] The policy reasons for granting public access to criminal proceedings include the public\u2019s right to monitor the functioning of our courts, thereby ensuring quality, honesty and respect for our legal system .\u00a0 Such policy reasons apply to the grant of public access to civil cases as well. [18]\n\nThe importance of access to public records, court records more particularly, was explained in Lantaco, Sr. v. Llamas , [19] where the respondent Judge therein refused to furnish the complainants a copy of his decision.\u00a0 According to the Court, the importance of this right to access to court records is predicated on the right of the people to acquire information on matters of public concern in which the public has a legitimate interest.\u00a0 It was further explained that while the public officers in custody of control of public records have the discretion to regulate the manner in which such records may be inspected, examined or copied by interested persons, such discretion does not carry with it the authority to prohibit such access, inspection, examination or copying.\u00a0 To drive home the point, the Court cited its pronouncement in Baldoza v. Dimaano , [20] to wit:\n\u2026 The incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a recognition of the fundamental role of free exchange of information in a democracy.\u00a0 There can be no realistic perception by the public of the nation\u2019s problems, nor a meaningful democratic decision-making if they are denied access to information of general interest.\u00a0 Information is needed to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of the times.\u00a0 As has been aptly observed: \u201cMaintaining the flow of such information depends on protection for both its acquisition and its dissemination since, if either process is interrupted, the flow inevitably ceases.\u201d However, restrictions on access to certain records may be imposed by law.\u00a0 Thus, access restrictions imposed to control civil insurrection have been permitted upon a showing of immediate and impending danger that renders ordinary means of control inadequate to maintain order. [21]\nWe agree with the following ratiocination of the Investigating Justice:\nHowever, the constitutional guarantee to information on matters of public concern is not absolute.\u00a0 Under the Constitution, access to official records, papers, etc., are \u201csubject to limitations as may be provided by law.\u201d Therefore, a law may exempt certain types of information from public scrutiny such as matters on national security.\u00a0 Otherwise stated, the availability of access to a particular public record must be restricted by the nature of the information sought, i.e. , (a) of public concern or one that involves public interest, and (b) not being exempted by law from the operation of the constitutional guarantee.\n\nThe privilege against disclosure is recognized with respect to state secrets bearing on military, diplomatic and similar matters.\u00a0 This privilege is based upon public interest of such paramount importance which transcends the individual interests of a private citizen, even though, as a consequence thereof, the plaintiff cannot enforce his legal rights.\n\nSP No. 97505 does not contain any military or diplomatic secret which will be disclosed by its production.\u00a0 Neither is there any law or regulation which considers the case records as classified information.\n\nThe right to information is subject to reasonable regulations and restrictions.\u00a0 However, while public officers in custody or control of public records have the discretion to regulate the manner in which such records may be inspected, examined or copied by interested persons, such discretion does not carry with it the authority to prohibit such access, inspection, examination or\u00a0 copying. [22]\nThe Court thus rules that for denying the complainants access to court records, the respondent Judge must be reprimanded.\n\nThe respondent Judge cannot be similarly chastised for ruling that the complainants were not parties-in-interest in the subject case.\u00a0 It is settled that as a matter of policy, the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action.\u00a0 He cannot be subjected to liability \u2013 civil, criminal or administrative \u2013 for any of his official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as he acts in good faith. [23] Only judicial errors tainted with fraud, dishonesty, gross ignorance, bad faith or deliberate intent to do an injustice will be administratively sanctioned. [24] To hold, otherwise, would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. [25] Indeed, an administrative complaint against a judge cannot be pursued simultaneously with the judicial remedies accorded to parties aggrieved by his erroneous order or judgment.\u00a0 Administrative remedies are neither alternative nor cumulative to judicial review where such review is available to the aggrieved parties and the same has not yet been resolved with finality. For until there is a final declaration by the appellate court that the challenged order or judgment is manifestly erroneous, there will be no basis to conclude whether respondent judge is administratively liable . [26]\n\nThus, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not to file an administrative complaint against the judge, but to elevate the assailed decision or order to the higher court for review and correction, [27] which in this case the complainants have already done.\u00a0 The Court notes that in a Decision dated February 27, 2004, the CA dismissed the petition questioning the ruling of the respondent Judge that the complainants were not parties-in-interest in Sp. Proc. 00-97505, and that the complainants elevated such dismissal to this Court via a petition for review.\n\nIt must be stressed that an administrative complaint is not an appropriate remedy where judicial recourse is still available, such as a motion for reconsideration, an appeal, or a petition for certiorari, unless the assailed order or decision is tainted with fraud, malice, or dishonesty. [28] The Court has to be shown acts or conduct of the judge clearly indicative of arbitrariness or prejudice before the latter can be branded the stigma of being biased and partial.\u00a0 Good faith and absence of malice, corrupt motives or improper considerations, are sufficient defenses in which a judge charged with ignorance of the law can find refuge. [29] In this case, no bad faith can be attributed to the respondent Judge for relying on the ruling of this Court in Lantaco v. Llamas , [30] albeit erroneously.\n\nWHEREFORE , for denying the complainants access to court records, respondent Judge Amor A. Reyes is hereby REPRIMANDED .\u00a0 She is sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Tinga, and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 12-29.\n\n[2] Id . at 32-34.\n\n[3] Id . at 36-46.\n\n[4] Id . at 15.\n\n[5] Id . at 18-19.\n\n[6] Id . at 75-78.\n\n[7] The complainants filed an Omnibus Motion dated October 8, 2001 ( Rollo , pp. 79-83) praying, among others, that the respondent Judge set a deadline for the submission of a verified and complete inventory of the estate of the decedent, as well as to order the Administratrix to submit a verified annual account and her subsequent examination under oath with respect thereto.\u00a0 The complainants also filed a Motion for Reconsideration of [the] Order dated February 1, 2001 (Ratifying Action of Administratrix in Voting Shares in Favor of the Sale of all the Assets of Traders Royal Bank), praying that the approval of the action taken by the Administratrix be recalled and to withhold action on the Request/Motion of the Administratrix until the requirements of the Rules are complied with ( Id . at 84-88).\n\n[8] Rollo , pp. 89-90.\n\n[9] Id . at 140-141.\n\n[10] Final Report and Recommendation, pp. 24-29.\n\n[11] Id . at 33-34.\n\n[12] In response to the Letter of the complainants\u2019 counsel inquiring as to whether the petitioner in Sp.

NO. 161836, February 28, 2006 ]\n\nMANILA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY AND FRANCISCO E. ATAYDE, PETITIONERS, VS. JOAQUIN RODRIGUEZ, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nMANILA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY AND FRANCISCO E. ATAYDE, PETITIONERS, VS. JOAQUIN RODRIGUEZ, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nOnce again the perennial clash between government taking for public purpose, on one hand, and individual property rights, on the other, comes to fore, with the present case rendered interesting by a couple of twists. Apparently the taking was effected without the aegis of an expropriation case and yet the present owner of the property who is claiming compensation purchased it knowing that it has long been used as part of the airport runway.\n\nIn the early seventies, petitioner Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), the government-owned and controlled corporation managing and operating the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Complex, implemented expansion programs for its runway. This necessitated the acquisition and occupation of some of the properties surrounding its premises. Expropriation proceedings were thus initiated over most of the properties.\n\nOn 12 January 1996, the MIAA through its then General Manager, petitioner Francisco Atayde (Atayde), received a letter [1] from respondent Joaquin Rodriguez (Rodriguez) proposing to sell at P2,350.00 per square meter, one of the lots already occupied by the expanded runway but assumed as not yet expropriated by the MIAA. The proposal did not ripen to a deal. Subsequently, on 29 April 1996, Rodriguez bought the bigger lot a portion of which was occupied by the runway, as well as all the rights to claim reasonable rents and damages for the occupation, from its owner then, Buck Estate, Inc., for P4,000,000.00. [2] The property purchased per the covering title [3] has a total area of 9,687 square meters, of which a portion consisting of 7,687.5 square meters was then already occupied by the runway. This occupied portion is hereinafter referred to as the subject lot.\n\nIn a letter dated 20 January 1997, Rodriguez, through counsel, demanded from the MIAA full payment for the property and back rentals for 27 years, amounting to P468,800,000.00. [4] As he did not reach an agreement with the MIAA, Rodriguez filed a case for accion reinvindicatoria with damages. [5] Finding that the MIAA had illegally taken possession of the property, the trial court held:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:\nOrdering defendant to pay plaintiff the amount of P70,868,936.72 as rental for the property from 1972 to 1998; Ordering defendant to pay P15,000.00 per square meter as purchase price of the property occupied by it; Ordering defendant to pay exemplary damages in the amount of P1,000,000.00; Ordering defendant to pay attorney's fees equivalent to 5% of the amount due. SO ORDERED. [6] The MIAA elevated the case to the Court of Appeals, imputing as errors: (i) the award of rentals commencing from 1972; (ii) the award of exemplary damages; and (iii) the order to pay P145,305,000.00 as purchase price of the property. [7] In its Decision of 4 July 2003, the Court of Appeals modified the trial court's Decision, holding that Rodriguez is entitled to back rentals only from the time he became the registered owner of the property in 1996. According to the appellate court, the award of rentals was not based on a contract of lease; rather, it was a grant of damages representing unearned rentals or unrealized profits. Such damages, it was explained, must have been inflicted directly upon the person seeking the indemnification; thus, Rodriguez cannot claim damages he did not personally sustain or unrealized profits before he acquired the property. [8]\n\nThe parties filed separate motions for reconsideration. [9] On 28 January 2004, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, this Court resolves to:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | PARTIALLY GRANTplaintiff-appellees' motion for reconsideration by including the following rate of legal interest in the award of rentals:\n | \n | \"Six (6%) percent per annum to be computed from the time of the judicial demand and twelve (12%) percent interest, in lieu of the six (6%) percent, upon the finality of the decision until the payment thereof.\"\n | \n(2) | DENYdefendant-appellants' motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) PARTIALLY GRANT plaintiff-appellees' motion for reconsideration by including the following rate of legal interest in the award of rentals: \"Six (6%) percent per annum to be computed from the time of the judicial demand and twelve (12%) percent interest, in lieu of the six (6%) percent, upon the finality of the decision until the payment thereof.\" (2) DENY defendant-appellants' motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED . [10]\nBoth the MIAA and Atayde, as petitioners, have thus come before this Court. They claim that Rodriguez was a buyer in bad faith, having purchased the subject lot in a highly speculative and scheming manner, [11] and in anticipation of a grossly disproportionate amount of profit at the expense of the Government. [12] This bad faith, according to petitioners, was made evident by the fact that: (i)Rodriguez knew that the airport had been occupying the subject property even before he bought it, and he bought it at the very low price of P4,000,000.00; (ii) three months before he purchased the property, Rodriguez had written to Atayde, claiming to have the certificate of title in his name and offering to sell the lot to the MIAA for P2,350.00 per square meter; and (iii) after purchasing the property, Rodriguez increased his asking price to P9,000.00 per square meter. [13] Since Rodriguez was a buyer in bad faith, petitioners stress that the decisions of the courts below entitling him to amass profits of more than P200,000,000.00 is contrary to morals, good customs and public policy, and would lead to his unjust enrichment. [14]\n\nFurther, petitioners allege that there is no basis for awarding exemplary damages and attorney's fees in favor of Rodriguez since the MIAA in fact exerted efforts to negotiate with Rodriguez. Considering that the Court of Appeals had ruled that Rodriguez could not claim damages in the form of rentals from 1972 to 1995, the alleged encroachment starting in 1972 should not be used as basis for computing and awarding damages and attorney's fees, petitioners add. [15]\n\nPetitioners posit that compared to Rodriguez's conduct of bad faith, the MIAA acted in good faith when it occupied the subject lot. They claim that the property, which was then comprised of two (2) smaller lots owned by one Eugenio Cruz, had already been expropriated by the Republic of the Philippines as early as the 1970s. Since then, and after the expansion of the runway in 1972, nobody had attempted to recover the subject lot or to demand compensation therefor (except Rodriguez). [16]\n\nFinally, even assuming that the MIAA is required to pay compensation for the subject lot once more, the same could not be at the current price of P15,000.00 per square meter as ruled by the appellate court, but rather in the price at the time of the taking, [17] petitioners close.\n\nOn the other hand, Rodriguez argues that the instant petition calls for a review of the finding of facts of the Court of Appeals which is not allowed in a petition for certiorari under Rule 45. Besides, the appellate court did not commit any reversible error.\n\nPrivate property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. [18] This is a constitutional mandate that we must once more put in force. Pertinently, therefore, the Court must determine the basis of compensation, as well as the kind and form of damages due Rodriguez as a consequence of the MIAA's use and occupation of the subject lot. Likewise, the Court has to decide on the alleged bad faith on the part of Rodriguez in purchasing the property.\n\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\n\nWhile the instant case stemmed from the accion reinvindicatoria t hat Rodriguez had filed, it essentially revolves around the taking of the subject lot by the MIAA. There is \"taking\" when the expropriator enters private property not only for a momentary period but for a more permanent duration, or for the purpose of devoting the property to a public use in such a manner as to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment thereof. [19] In this context, there was taking when the MIAA occupied a portion thereof for its expanded runway.\n\nThe instant case is certainly neither unique nor of first impression. Where actual taking was made without the benefit of expropriation proceedings, and the owner sought recovery of the possession of the property prior to the filing of expropriation proceedings, the Court has invariably ruled that it is the value of the property at the time of taking that is controlling for purposes of compensation.\n\nThus, in Commissioner of Public Highways v. Burgos , [20] wherein it took the owner of a parcel of land thirty-five (35) years before she filed a case for recovery of possession taken by the local government unit for a road-right-of-way purpose, this Court held:\n...there being no other legal provision cited which would justify a departure form the rule that just compensation is determined on the basis of the value of the property at the time of the taking thereof in expropriation by the Government, the value of the property as it is when the Government took possession of the land in question, not the increased value resulting from the passage of time which invariably brings unearned increment to landed properties, represents the true value to be paid as just compensation for the property taken. [21]\nIn Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr. , [22] where the owners of two (2) lots used by the Government for road widening sought compensation twenty-six (26) years after the lots were taken, the Court ruled in the same vein, thus:\nThe sole question thus confronting the Court involves the precise time at which just compensation should be fixed, whether as of the time of actual taking of possession by the expropriating entity or, as the Ansaldos maintain, only after conveyance of title to the expropriator pursuant to expropriation proceedings duly instituted since it is only at such a time that the constitutional requirements of due process aside from those of just compensation may be fully met. [23]\n\nX X X X\n\nIt is as of the time of such a taking, to repeat, that the just compensation for the property is to be established. As stated in Republic v. Philippine National Bank,\n\". . . (W)hen plaintiff takes possession before the institution of the condemnation proceedings, the value should be fixed as of the time of the taking of said possession, not of filing of the complaint and the latter should be the basis for the determination of the value, when the taking of the property involved coincides with or is subsequent to, the commencement of the proceedings. Indeed, otherwise, the provision of Rule 69, Section 3, directing that compensation 'be determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint' would never be operative. As intimated in Republic v. Lara (supra), said provision contemplates 'normal circumstances,' under which 'the complaint coincides or even precedes the taking of the property by the plaintiff.\"\nThe reason for the rule, as pointed out in Republic v. Lara, is that \u2014\n\". . . (W)here property is taken ahead of the filing of the condemnation proceedings, the value thereof may be enchanced by the public purpose for which it is taken; the entry by the plaintiff upon the property may have depreciated its value thereby; or, there may have been a natural increase in the value of the property from the time the complaint is filed, due to general economic conditions. The owner of private property should be compensated only for what he actually loses; it is not intended that his compensation shall extend beyond his loss or injury. And what he loses is only the actual value of his property at the time it is taken. This is the only way that compensation to be paid can be truly just; i.e., 'just not only to the individual whose property is taken,' 'but to the public, which is to pay for it.'\"\nClearly, then, the value of the Ansaldos' property must be ascertained as of the year 1947, when it was actually taken, and not at the time of the filing of the expropriation suit, which, by the way, still has to be done. It is as of that time that the real measure of their loss may fairly be adjudged. The value, once fixed, shall earn interest at the legal rate until full payment is effected, conformably with other principles laid down by case law. [24]\nThe ruling was reiterated in Eslaban v. Vda. De Onorio . [25] There, a main irrigation canal was constructed over a piece of land by the National Irrigation Administration but the property owner filed the complaint seeking compensation only nine (9) years later. The Court declared:\nThus, the value of the property must be determined either as of the date of the taking of the property or the filing of the complaint, \"whichever came first.\" Even before the new rule, however, it was already held in Commissioner of Public Highways v. Burgos that the price of the land at the time of taking, not its value after the passage of time, represents the true value to be paid as just compensation. It was, therefore, error for the Court of Appeals to rule that the just compensation to be paid to respondent should be determined as of the filing of the complaint in 1990, and not the time of its taking by the NIA in 1981, because petitioner was allegedly remiss in its obligation to pay respondent, and it was respondent who filed the complaint. In the case of Burgos, it was also the property owner who brought the action for compensation against the government after 25 years since the taking of his property for the construction of a road.\n\nIndeed, the value of the land may be affected by many factors. It may be enhanced on account of its taking for public use, just as it may depreciate. As observed in Republic v. Lara:\n[W]here property is taken ahead of the filing of the condemnation proceedings, the value thereof may be enhanced by the public purpose for which it is taken; the entry by the plaintiff upon the property may have depreciated its value thereby; or there may have been a natural increase in the value of the property from the time it is taken to the time the complaint is filed, due to general economic conditions. The owner of private property should be compensated only for what he actually loses; it is not intended that his compensation shall extend beyond his loss or injury. And what he loses is only the actual value of his property at the time it is taken. This is the only way that compensation to be paid can be truly just, i.e. , \"just\" not only to the individual whose property is taken, \"but to the public, which is to pay for it\" . . . .\nIn this case, the proper valuation for the property in question is P16,047.61 per hectare, the price level for 1982, based on the appraisal report submitted by the commission (composed of the provincial treasurer, assessor, and auditor of South Cotabato) constituted by the trial court to make an assessment of the expropriated land and fix the price thereof on a per hectare basis. [26] Per the findings of the trial court, [27] the subject lot was occupied as a runway of the MIAA starting in 1972. Thus, the value of the lot in 1972 should serve as the basis for the award of compensation to the owner. However, said value does not appear in the record.\n\nNow, the question of actual damages for the occupation of the subject lot.\n\nUndeniably, the MIAA's illegal occupation for more than twenty (20) years has resulted in pecuniary loss to Rodriguez and his predecessors-in-interest. Such pecuniary loss entitles him to adequate compensation in the form of actual or compensatory damages, [28] which in this case should be the legal interest (6%) [29] on the value of the land at the time of taking, from said point up to full payment by the MIAA. [30] This is based on the principle that interest \"runs as a matter of law and follows from the right of the landowner to be placed in as good position as money can accomplish, as of the date of the taking.\" [31]\n\nThe award of interest renders unwarranted the grant of back rentals as extended by the courts below. In Republic v. Lara, et al. , [32] the Court ruled that the indemnity for rentals is inconsistent with a property owner's right to be paid legal interest on the value of the property, for if the condemnor is to pay the compensation due to the owners from the time of the actual taking of their property, the payment of such compensation is deemed to retroact to the actual taking of the property; and, hence, there is no basis for claiming rentals from the time of actual taking. [33] More explicitly, the Court held in Republic v. Garcellano [34] that :\nThe uniform rule of this Court, however, is that this compensation must be, not in the form of rentals, but by way of 'interest from the date that the company [or entity] exercising the right of eminent domain take possession of the condemned lands, and the amounts granted by the court shall cease to earn interest only from the moment they are paid to the owners or deposited in court x x x. [35] Petitioners claim that Rodriguez is a buyer in bad faith since prior to his purchase he was aware of the MIAA's occupation of the property and therefore proceeded with the purchase in anticipation of enormous profits from the subsequent sale to the MIAA. The point is irrelevant. Regardless of whether or not Rodriguez acted in bad faith, all that he will be entitled to is the value of the property at the time of the taking, with legal interest thereon from that point until full payment of the compensation by the MIAA. Besides, assuming the question is of any consequence, the circumstances surrounding Rodriguez's purchase may not even amount to bad faith. Bad faith has been defined as a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive of self-interest or ill will or for an ulterior purpose, and implies a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. [36] There is nothing wrongful or dishonest in expecting to profit from one's investment. However, Rodriguez can fault but only himself for taking an obvious risk in purchasing property already being used for a public purpose. It was a self-inflicted misfortune that his investment did not generate the windfall he had expected. For ostensibly little did he know that he could not acquire more rights than the previous owners had since the government taking had taken place earlier.\n\nFor more than twenty (20) years, the MIAA occupied the subject lot without the benefit of expropriation proceedings and without the MIAA exerting efforts to ascertain ownership of the lot and negotiating with any of the owners of the property. To our mind, these are wanton and irresponsible acts which should be suppressed and corrected. Hence, the award of exemplary damages and attorneys fees is in order. However, while Rodriguez is entitled to such exemplary damages and attorney's fees, the award granted by the courts below should be equitably reduced. We hold that Rodriguez is entitled only to P200,000.00 as exemplary damages, and attorney's fees equivalent to one percent (1%) of the amount due.\n\nThe MIAA argues that it had already expropriated the subject lot back in the 1970s. However, the Court cannot pass upon this defense, it having been brought up for the first time. Points of law, theories, issues and arguments not adequately brought to the attention of the trial court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court as they cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. [37] Moreover, this new theory of previous expropriation is negated by the fact that petitioners negotiated with Rodriguez when the latter offered the subject property for sale to the MIAA, as evidenced by the correspondence between the parties. [38] If the MIAA already owned the property, there would be no more need to negotiate with Rodriguez; petitioners would have asserted such fact as soon as Rodriguez had offered to sell the property to them.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED IN PART. The Decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED as follows:\nThe MIAA is ordered to pay Joaquin Rodriguez just compensation for the subject lot, the portion actually occupied by the runway consisting of or based on the value thereof at the time of taking in 1972, with interest thereon at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the time of the taking until full payment is made. For the purpose of determining said value, the case is remanded to the lower court. Said court is ordered to make the determination with deliberate dispatch;\n\nThe award of back rentals as damages is DELETED;\n\nThe MIAA is ordered to PAY exemplary damages in the reduced amount of P200,000.00, and attorney's fees equivalent to one percent (1%) of the amount due.\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairman), Carpio and Carpio-Morales, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 104.\n\n[2] Deed of Absolute Sale, id. at 89-91.\n\n[3] After the purchase, TCT No. 109416 of the Registry of Deeds of Para\u00f1aque was issued to Rodriguez; id. at 87-88.\n\n[4] Id. at 92.\n\n[5] Id. at 82-86.

AND JOSE MARCEL PANLILIO, PETITIONERS, VS. ROGELIO S. SOLUTA, JOSELITO SANTOS, EDNA BERNATE, VICENTA DELOLA, FLORENTINO MATILLA, AND GLOWHRAIN-SILAHIS UNION CHAPTER, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nThe present Petition for Review on Certiorari partially assails the Court of Appeals Decision [1] of March 26, 2004 holding herein petitioners Silahis International Hotel, Inc. and Jose Marcel Panlilio, along with Floro Maniego and Steve Villanueva, civilly liable for damages under Article 32 of the Civil Code, for violation of respondents\u2019 constitutional right against unreasonable search of their office.\n\nPetitioner Jose Marcel Panlilio (Panlilio) was the Vice President for Finance of his co-petitioner Silahis International Hotel, Inc. (hotel), while respondents Rogelio Soluta (Soluta), Joselito Santos, Edna Bernate (Edna), Vicenta Delola (Vicenta), and Florentino Matilla (Matilla) were employees of the hotel and officers of the Glowhrain-Silahis Union Chapter, the hotel employees union (the union).\n\nPetitioners\u2019 version of the antecedents of the case are as follows:\n\nIn late 1987, as Coronel Floro Maniego (Maniego), General Manager of the Rapier Enforcement Professional Investigation and Security Agency, Inc. (REPISA) which the hotel contracted to provide its security force, had been receiving reports that sale and/or use of marijuana, dollar smuggling, and prostitution were going on in the union office at the hotel and that there existed a theft syndicate, he conducted a surveillance, with the approval of Panlilio, of suspected members and officers of the union. [2]\n\nIn the morning of January 11, 1988, Panlilio, his personal secretary Andy Dizon, Maniego, Bulletin reporter Nonoy Rosales, and REPISA security guard Steve Villanueva (Villanueva) entered the union office located at the hotel basement, with the permission of union officer Henry Babay (Babay) who was apprised about the suspected illegal activities, and searched the premises in the course of which Villanueva found a plastic bag under a table.\u00a0 When opened, the plastic bag yielded dry leaves of marijuana. [3] Panlilio thereupon ordered Maniego to investigate and report the matter to the authorities.\n\nOn the other hand, respondents\u2019 version follows:\n\nOn January 10, 1988, Loida Somacera (Loida), a laundrywoman of the hotel, stayed overnight at the female locker room at the basement of the hotel.\u00a0 At dawn of January 11, 1988, she heard pounding sounds outside, prompting her to open the door of the locker room upon which she saw five men in barong tagalog whom she failed to recognize but she was sure were not employees of the hotel, [4] forcibly opening the door of the union office. [5] She even saw one of the men hid something behind his back.\u00a0 She then closed the door and went back to bed. Soon after she heard the door of the union office opened.\n\nIn the morning of January 11, 1988, as union officer Soluta was trying in vain to open the door of the union office, Loida narrated to him what she had witnessed at dawn.\n\nSoluta thus immediately lodged a complaint before the Security Officer.\u00a0 And he fetched a locksmith, Efren Guevarra, who tried to assist him, Edna, Arnold Ilustrisimo and Ed Bautista open the door.\u00a0 At that instant, men in barong tagalog armed with clubs arrived and started hitting Soluta and his companions, drawing them to run to the female locker room, and to thereafter proceed to the Engineering Office where they called for police assistance. [6]\n\nWhile awaiting the arrival of the police, Babay and Panlilio, on the latter\u2019s request, met.\u00a0 At the meeting, Panlilio told Babay that they proceed to the union office where they would settle the mauling incident, to which Babay replied that the door of the office could not be opened.\u00a0 Panlilio thereupon instructed Villanueva to force open the door, and the latter did.\u00a0 Once inside, Panlilio and his companions began searching the office, over the objection of Babay who even asked them if they had a search warrant. [7] A plastic bag was found containing marijuana flowering tops.\n\nAs a result of the discovery of the presence of marijuana in the union office and after the police conducted an investigation of the incident, a complaint against the 13 union officers, [8] namely:\u00a0 Babay, Isaac Asuncion, Jr., Soluta, Teodoro Gimpayan, Vicenta, Edna, Arnulfo Ilustrisimo, Irene Velarde, Joselito Santos, Renato Lina, Avelino Meneses, Matilla, and Norman Agtani [9] was filed before the Fiscal\u2019s Office of Manila, for violation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6425, as amended by Batas Pambansa Bilang 179 (The Dangerous Drugs Act).\n\nAn Information [10] indicting the union officers was subsequently filed by the Fiscal\u2019s Office before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila.\n\nAfter trial, Branch 5 of the RTC acquitted the accused.\u00a0 The trial court disposed:\nWHEREFORE, with the specimen and/or the marijuana flowering tops allegedly found inside the Union Office occupied by the accused not admissible in evidence , c oupled by the suspicious circumstance of confiscation , for lack of sufficient evidence , accused Henry Babay, Isaac Asuncion, Jr., Rogelio Soluta, Teodoro F. Gimpayan, Vicente Delola, Edna Bernate, Arnulfo Ilustrisimo, Irene Velarde, Joselito Santos, Avelino Meneses, Florentino Matilla and Norman Agtani, are ACQUITTED of the charge. The bonds they put up for their provisional liberty are cancelled.\n\nThe Branch Clerk is directed to turn over the custody of the seized plastic bag containing flowering tops of marijuana to the NBI Director as Permanent Custodian of the seized Dangerous Drugs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nSoluta and his fellow union officers, together with the union, thereafter filed before the Manila RTC a Complaint [12] against petitioners et al. including prosecuting Fiscal Jose Bautista and Atty. Eduardo Tutaan who assisted in the prosecution of the case against them, for malicious prosecution and violation of their constitutional right against illegal search.\n\nAfter trial, Branch 55 of the Manila RTC, by Decision [13] dated June 2, 1994, held the hotel, Panlilio, Maniego and Villanueva jointly and severally liable for damages as a result of malicious prosecution and illegal search of the union office. The dispositive portion of the trial court\u2019s decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendants Silahis International Hotel, Inc., Jose Marcel Panlilio, Floro Maniego and Steve Villanueva, individually and collectively, jointly and severally, to pay to:\nPlaintiffs Union , Rogelio S. Soluta, Joselito Santos, Florentino Matilla, Vicenta Delola and Edna Bernate-Dacanay, jointly, the sum of P70,900.00 as actual damages, and the further sum of P1,000.00 each for the same plaintiffs, except the Union , in the same concept and nature.\n\nPlaintiffs Rogelio Soluta, Joselito Santos, Florentino Matilla, Vicenta Delola and Edna Bernate-Dacanay the sum of P100,000.00 each for moral damages.\n\nPlaintiffs Joselito Santos, Florentino Matilla, Vicenta Delola and Edna-Bernate-Dacanay the sum of P30,000.00 each as exemplary damages.\n\nTo all the plaintiffs, jointly and severally, the sum of P30,000.00 for and as attorney\u2019s fees . The complaint, insofar as plaintiff Erlisa Ilustrisimo and defendants Ramos, Bautista and Tutaan are concerned, is DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nAll the counterclaims of the defendants are likewise dismissed for lack of factual and legal basis.\n\nCosts against the remaining defendants.\n\nSO ORDERED. [14] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the trial court\u2019s decision.\u00a0 It found herein petitioners et al. civilly liable for damages for violation of individual respondents\u2019 constitutional right against illegal search, not for malicious prosecution, set aside the award of actual damages to respondent union, and reduced the award of actual damages to individual respondents to P50,000.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the appellate court\u2019s decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 55, is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification that the first paragraph of the dispositive portion should read:\n\n\u201c1. Plaintiffs Rogelio Soluta, Joselito Santos, Florentino Matilla, Vicenta Delola and Edna Bernate-Dacanay, jointly, the sum of P50,000.00 as actual damages, and the further sum of P1,000.00 each for the same plaintiffs in the same concept and nature.\u201d\n\nThe Decision is hereby AFFIRMED in all other respects.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15]\n\nHence, the present petition of Panlilio and the hotel, they contending that:\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN ITS CONCLUSION THAT PETITIONERS ARE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES UNDER ARTICLE 32 OF THE CIVIL CODE IN THAT: THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 APPLICATION OF PEOPLE V. ARUTA (288 SCRA 626[1998]) AND SECTION 13, RULE 126 OF THE RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN THE INSTANT CASE IS LEGALLY FLAWED. PETITIONERS\u2019 SEARCH OF THE UNION OFFICE IN THE INSTANT CASE WAS ENTIRELY REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. [16] While petitioners concede that the appellate court correctly cited the principles enunciated in People v. Aruta [17] and Section 13, Rule 126 [18] of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, it gravely erred when it applied Aruta to justify petitioners\u2019 alleged liability under Article 32 of the New Civil Code. They argue that Aruta does not involve Article 32 as nowhere in the decision is there any reference to Article 32. [19]\n\nSimilarly, petitioners argue that being private persons, they are not covered by the standards set forth in Aruta as the constitutional protection against illegal searches and seizures is not meant to be invoked against private individuals. [20]\n\nPetitioners further argue that the search of the union office was reasonable under the circumstances, [21] given that the hotel owns the room where the union holds office;\u00a0 the search was not without probable cause as it was conducted precisely due to reports received by petitioners that the union office was being used as a venue for illegal activities, particularly the sale and/or use of prohibited drugs; [22] and the search was conducted with the consent and in the presence of union officer Babay. [23]\n\nThe petition fails.\n\nArticle 32 of the New Civil Code provides:\nART. 32. Any public officer or employee, or any private individual, who directly or indirectly obstructs, defeats, violates or in any manner impedes or impairs any of the following rights and liberties of another person shall be liable to the latter for damages:\n\nx x x x\n\n(9) The right to be secure in one\u2019s person, house, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures;\n\nx x x x\nThe indemnity shall include moral damages.\u00a0 Exemplary damages may also be adjudicated.\u00a0 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nAs constitutional rights, like the right to be secure in one\u2019s person, house, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizures, occupy a lofty position in every civilized and democratic community and not infrequently susceptible to abuse, their violation, whether constituting a penal offense or not, must be guarded against. As the Code Commission noted,\nx x x x\n\n(3) Direct and open violations of the Penal Code trampling upon the freedoms named are not so frequent as those subtle, clever and indirect ways which do not come within the pale of the penal law. It is in these cunning devices of suppressing or curtailing freedom, which are not criminally punishable, where the greatest danger to democracy lies .\u00a0 The injured citizen will always have, under the new Civil Code, adequate civil remedies before the courts because of the independent civil action, even in those instances where the act or omission complained of does not constitute a criminal offense. [24]\nThe Code Commission thus deemed it necessary to hold not only public officers but also private individuals civilly liable for violation of rights enumerated in Article 32 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 That is why it is not even necessary that the defendant under this Article should have acted with malice or bad faith, otherwise, it would defeat its main purpose, which is the effective protection of individual rights. [25] It suffices that there is a violation of the constitutional right of the plaintiff.\n\nIn the present case, as priorly stated, petitioners had, by their own claim, already received reports in late 1987 of illegal activities allegedly undertaken in the union office and Maniego conducted surveillance of the union officers.\u00a0 Yet, in the morning of January 11, 1988, petitioners and their companions barged into and searched the union office without a search warrant, despite ample time for them to obtain one, and notwithstanding the objection of Babay.\n\nThe course taken by petitioners and company stinks in illegality, it not falling under any of the exceptional instances when a warrantless search is allowed by law.\u00a0 Petitioners\u2019 violation of individual respondents\u2019 constitutional right against unreasonable search thus furnishes the basis for the award of damages under Article 32 of the Civil Code.\n\nIn MHP Garments, Inc. v. Court of Appeals , [26] a case for unfair competition, the progression of time between the receipt of the information and the raid of the stores of the therein private respondents\u2019 premises showed that there was sufficient time for the therein petitioners and the raiding party to apply for a judicial warrant.\u00a0 Yet they did not apply for one.\u00a0 They went on with the raid and seized the goods of the therein private respondents.\u00a0 Under the circumstances, this court upheld the grant of damages by the trial court to the therein private respondents for violation of their right against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nAs for petitioners\u2019 contention that property rights justified the search of the union office, the same does not lie.\u00a0 For respondents, being the lawful occupants of the office, had the right to raise the question of validity of the search and seizure. [27]\n\nNeither does petitioners\u2019 claim that they were allowed by union officer Babay to enter the union office lie.\u00a0 Babay\u2019s account of why petitioners and company went to the union office \u2013 to consider Panlilio\u2019s suggestion to settle the mauling incident is more credible, as is his claim that he protested the search, and even asked if they were armed with a search warrant.\n\nWhile it is doctrinal that the right against unreasonable searches and seizures is a personal right which may be waived expressly or impliedly, a waiver by implication cannot be presumed. There must be clear and convincing evidence of an actual intention to relinquish it to constitute a waiver thereof. [28] There must be proof of the following: (a) that the right exists; (b) that the person involved had knowledge, either actual or constructive, of the existence of such right; and, (c) that the said person had an actual intention to relinquish the right.\u00a0 In other words, the waiver must be voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made.\u00a0 The evidence shows otherwise, however.\n\nThat a violation of one\u2019s constitutional right against illegal search and seizure can be the basis for the recovery of damages under Article 32 in relation to Article 2219(6) and (10) of the New Civil Code, there is no doubt.\u00a0 Since the complaint [29] filed before the trial court was for damages due to malicious prosecution and violation of constitutional right against illegal search and seizure, the award by the trial court of actual damages to respondent union was correctly set aside by the appellate court.\n\nArticle 32 speaks of an officer or employee or person \u201c directly or indirectly \u201d responsible for the violation of the constitutional rights and liberties of another.\u00a0 Hence, it is not the actor alone who must answer for damages under Article 32;\u00a0 the person indirectly responsible has also to answer for the damages or injury caused to the aggrieved party. [30] Such being the case, petitioners, together with Maniego and Villanueva, the ones who orchestrated the illegal search, are jointly and severally liable for actual, moral and exemplary damages to herein individual respondents in accordance with the earlier-quoted pertinent provision of Article 32, in relation to Article 2219(6) and (10) of the Civil Code which provides:\nArt. 2219.\u00a0 Moral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases:\n\nx x x x\n\n(6)\u00a0 Illegal search;\n\nx x x x\n\n(10)\u00a0 Acts and action referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32 , 34 and 35.\u00a0 (Emphasis supplied)\nPetitioners magnify the citation by the appellate court of Aruta allegedly \u201cto justify [their] liability\u201d under Article 32 of the Civil Code, which petitioners allege is erroneous as said case did not involve Article 32.\n\nAruta was, however, cited by the appellate court, not to justify petitioners\u2019 liability but to rule out the legality of the search in the union office as the search was not done as an incident of a lawful arrest.\n\nPetitioners cite People v. Marti [31] to support their thesis that the determinants in the validity of the constitutional right against searches and seizure cannot be invoked against private individuals.\n\nBut the ruling of this Court in Marti , a criminal case, bears on the issue of whether \u201can act of a private individual, allegedly in violation of [one\u2019s] constitutional rights, [may] be invoked against the State.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, the issue in that case was whether the evidence obtained by a private person, acting in a private capacity without the participation of the State, is admissible.\n\nThe issue in the present civil case, however, is whether respondent individual can recover damages for violation of constitutional rights.\u00a0 As reflected above, Article 32, in relation to Article 2219(6) and (10) of the Civil Code, allows so.\n\nWHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing ratiocinations, the petition is DENIED.\n\nCosts against petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairman), Carpio and Tinga, JJ ., concur.\n[1] Rollo , p. 34, penned by Justice Jose C.

      "title": "RUFINO S. MAMANGUN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N GARCIA, J.: In this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitioner Rufino Mamangun y Silverio seeks the reversal of the Decision[1] dated January 19, 2001 (promulgated on February 13, 2001) of the Sandiganbayan in its Criminal Case No. 21131, convicting him of the crime of Homicide.The factual backdrop:On September 12, 1994, herein petitioner, then a police officer, was charged before the Sandiganbayan with the crime of Murder, allegedly committed, per the indicting Information,[2] docketed as Criminal Case No. 21131, as follows:That on or about the 31st day of July 1992, in the Municipality of Meycauyan, (sic) Province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Rufino S. Mamangun, a public officer, being then a Police Officer (PO2), duly appointed as such and acting in relation to his office, armed with a gun, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, attack, assault and shoot one Gener M. Contreras with the said gun, hitting the latter on his body, thereby inflicting (sic) him serious physical injuries which directly cause (sic) his death.CONTRARY TO LAW.On arraignment, petitioner, as accused below, duly assisted by a counsel de oficio, entered a plea of \"Not Guilty.\"In the ensuing trial, the prosecution presented in evidence the testimonies of Crisanto Ayson (Ayson), an alleged eyewitness, and Dr. Benito Caballero, then the designated Medico-Legal Officer of Bulacan who performed an autopsy on the cadaver of the victim.For its part, the defense adduced in evidence the testimonies of the accused himself, Rufino Mamangun, his co-policemen at the Philippine National Police (PNP), namely, PO2 Carlito Cruz, PO4 Hobert O. Diaz and Police Investigator SPO-1 Hernando B. Banez, all assigned at the Meycauayan Police Station; and those of Lorenzo S. Abacan and Rogelio Ingco, son and son-in-law, respectively, of Antonio Abacan, owner of the house on which rooftop the shooting of the victim took place.It is not disputed that on July 31, 1992, at about 8:00 in the evening, in Brgy. Calvario, Meycauayan, Bulacan a certain Liberty Contreras was heard shouting, \"Magnanakaw...Magnanakaw.\" Several residents responded and thereupon chased the suspect who entered the yard of Antonio Abacan and proceeded to the rooftop of Abacan's house.At about 9:00 o'clock that same evening, the desk officer of the Meycauayan PNP Police Station, upon receiving a telephone call that a robbery-holdup was in progress in Brgy. Calvario, immediately contacted and dispatched to the scene the crew of Patrol Car No. 601 composed of Team Leader SPO1 Andres Legaspi, with PO2 Eugenio Aminas and herein petitioner PO2 Rufino S. Mamangun; and Patrol Car No. 602 composed of Team Leader PO3 Sandiego San Gabriel, with PO2 Carlito Cruz and PO2 Hobert Diaz. With the permission of Abacan, petitioner Mamangun, PO2 Diaz and PO2 Cruz went to the rooftop of the house whereat the suspect was allegedly taking refuge.The three policemen, i.e., petitioner, Diaz and Cruz, each armed with a drawn handgun, searched the rooftop. There, they saw a man whom they thought was the robbery suspect. At that instance, petitioner Mamangun, who was walking ahead of the group, fired his handgun once, hitting the man. The man turned out to be Gener Contreras (Contreras) who was not the robbery suspect.Contreras died from the gunshot wound. The autopsy conducted by Dr. Benito B. Caballero yielded the following findings:The cause of death was \"Shock due to massive external and internal hemorrhage due to multiple gunshot wounds in the left arm side of the thorax, penetrating the left lung and vertebral column.\" There were several wounds caused by one (1) bullet.As shown on the sketch of human body attached to the Certificate of Death, and as testified on by Dr. Caballero, the bullet entered through the \"lower third of the left arm, left side of the thorax and it penetrated the left lung and vertebral column and that is where the slug was found.\" From a layman's appreciation of the sketch, the bullet entered the outer, upper left arm of the victim, exited through the inner side of the said upper left arm, a little lower than the left armpit and the slug lodging on the victim's back where it was recovered at the vertebral column.[3]From the foregoing admitted or undisputed facts, the prosecution and the defense presented conflicting versions as to how the fatal shooting of Contreras by petitioner Mamangun actually happened.According to Ayson, the lone eyewitness for the prosecution, he accompanied the three policemen (Mamangun, Diaz and Cruz) to the rooftop of Abacan's house. He was following petitioner Mamangun who was ahead of the group. They passed through the second-floor door of the house to the rooftop. The roof was lighted by an incandescent bulb from an adjacent house. He was beside Mamangun when they saw, some four to five arms-length away, a man whom he (witness) recognized as Gener Contreras. Mamangun pointed his .45 cal. pistol at the man, who instantly exclaimed, \"Hindi ako, hindi ako!,\" to which Mamangun replied, \"Anong hindi ako?\" Before he (Ayson) could say anything, Mamangun fired his gun, hitting the man who turned out to be Contreras. He (witness) approached the victim who was then lying on his left side unconscious. He brought down the victim and they rushed him to the hospital where he died at about 10:00 o'clock that same evening.The defense has its own account of what purportedly actually transpired.PO2 Mamangun, along with PO2 Cruz and PO2Diaz, denied the presence of Ayson at the rooftop during the shooting incident. Corroborating one another, the three testified that they were the only ones at the scene of the shooting, and that it was dark. They claimed that each of them, with Mamangun on the lead, went on separate directions around a water tank. As they met each other at the other side of the tank, PO2 Cruz pointed to a person crouching at the edge of the roof of the garage. Thinking that the person was the suspect they were looking for, Mamangun chased said person. They announced that they were police officers but the person continued to run in a crouching position until Mamangun caught up with him and shouted, \"Pulis. Tigil,\" whereupon the person suddenly stopped, turned around, faced Mamangun, and raised a stainless steel pipe towards the latter's head but Mamangun was able to evade the attack. This prompted Mamangun to shoot the person on the left arm. All three claimed that it was only at this point that PO2 Cruz and Diaz approached Contreras who told them, \"Hindi ako. Hindi ako.\" Mamangun went near Contreras and asked, \"Why did you go to the rooftop? You know there are policemen here.\" Contreras was thereafter brought to the hospital where he died. After the shooting incident, Mamangun reported the same to the desk officer, POI Filomeno de Luna, who advised him to remain in the police station. De Luna directed Police Investigator Hernando Banez to investigate the incident. That same evening, Investigator Banez went to the place where the shooting happened. Banez allegedly found a steel pipe about three (3) feet long on the depressed portion of the roof.On January 19, 2001, after due proceedings, the Sandiganbayan came out with its decision[4] finding the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of only the crime of Homicide. In so finding, the Sandiganbayan did not appreciate the presence of the aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength to qualify the killing to Murder. But even as the said court rejected the petitioner's claim that the shooting was justified by self-defense, it nonetheless ruled that the crime of Homicide was attended by an incomplete justifying circumstance of the petitioner having acted in the performance of his duty as a policeman, and also appreciated in his favor the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Dispositively, the decision reads:WHEREFORE, the accused, RUFINO S. MAMANGUN, is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide, defined and penalized under Article 249, Revised Penal Code, and taking into account the attendance of one (1) privileged mitigation (sic) circumstance, one generic circumstance and no aggravating circumstance, he is hereby sentenced under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of from Three (3) Years and Three (3) Months of prision correctional as minimum, to Seven (7) years of prision mayor, as maximum, to indemnify the heirs (parents) of Gener Contreras in the total amount of P352,025.00, and to past the costs.SO ORDERED.Unable to accept the judgment of conviction, petitioner is now with this Court via the present recourse alleging that the Sandiganbayan committed reversible error in failing to apply paragraph 5, Article 11, of the Revised Penal Code, which would have absolved him from criminal liability on the basis of his submission that the shooting in question was done in the performance of a duty or in the lawful exercise of a right or office.First off, petitioner insists that the shooting, which ultimately caused the demise of Contreras, was justified because he was repelling Contreras' unlawful attack on his person, as Contreras was then about to strike him on the head with a steel pipe.We are not persuaded.Well-settled is the rule that factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are conclusive upon the Court except where: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts and the findings of fact are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record.[5] None of these exceptions obtains in this case.Having admitted[6] the fatal shooting of Contreras on the night of July 31, 1992, petitioner is charged with the burden of adducing convincing evidence to show that the killing was done in the fulfillment of his duty as a policeman.The justifying circumstance of fulfillment of duty under paragraph 5, Article II, of the Revised Penal Code may be invoked only after the defense successfully proves that: (1) the accused acted in the performance of a duty; and (2) the injury inflicted or offense committed is the necessary consequence of the due performance or lawful exercise of such duty.[7]Concededly, the first requisite is present in this case. Petitioner, a police officer, was responding to a robbery-holdup incident. His presence at the situs of the crime was in accordance with the performance of his duty. However, proof that the shooting and ultimate death of Contreras was a necessary consequence of the due performance of his duty as a policeman is essential to exempt him from criminal liability.As we see it, petitioner's posturing that he shot Contreras because the latter tried to strike him with a steel pipe was a mere afterthought to exempt him from criminal liability.We see no plausible basis to depart from the Sandiganbayan's findings that there was no reason for the petitioner to shoot Contreras. The latter was unarmed and had already uttered, \"Hindi po ako, Hindi po ako\" before the petitioner fatally shot him on the left arm. Prosecution witness Ayson, who was then behind the petitioner when the latter shot Contreras, testified that to the victim's utterances, the petitioner even responded, \"Anong hindi ako,\" and immediately shot Contreras.[8] As correctly observed by the Sandiganbayan:Besides being self-serving (with respect to the accused) and biased (with respect to his co-policemen-witnesses), We find (1) the claim of the accused and his co-policemen-witnesses that the victim (Contreras) attacked the said accused and (2) their seemingly \"positive\" identification of the stainless steel pipe (more of a rod) as his weapon, to be of doubtful credibility, for the following reasons:(1) We have no doubt that, as claimed by PO2 Carlito Cruz and PO2 Hobert Diaz, the three policemen appropriately identified themselves as police officers as they started chasing the man they saw \"crouching,\" and, as claimed by accused PO2 Rufino Mamangun, that, as he was about to catch up with said man, he shouted, \"Pulis! Tigil!\" With all these introductions and forewarnings, it is utterly incredible and contrary to human experience that, that man, later identified to be Gener Contreras and admittedly not the person they were looking for, purportedly armed only with a stainless steel \"lead\" pipe (more of a rod) would suddenly stop, turn around and attack one of the three policemen who were chasing him, one after the other, with drawn guns.(2) When the victim (Gener Contreras) fell down after being shot by accused PO2 Mamangun, and as the latter went near the fallen victim, said accused asked, \"Why did you go to the rooftop. You know there are policemen here.\" He admits that he did not ask the victim, \"Why did you try to hit me, if you are not the one?\" This admission clearly belies the claim of the police-witnesses that Gener Contreras attacked the accused policeman with an iron pipe when he was shot, for the accused should have asked the latter question.(3) The location of the entry of the bullet fired by accused Mamangun which is at the outer left arm at about the bicep of the victim and its trajectory as it penetrated his body hitting his vital organs along the way belies the claim of the accused that the victim was facing him and had just missed his head with an iron pipe, as instead the victim must have instinctively shielded his body with his left arm.Moreover, petitioner's pretense that Contreras struck him with a steel pipe is intriguing. As it is, petitioner did not report the same to Police Investigator Banez when he reported back to the police station after the shooting incident. It was only when a lead pipe was recovered from the scene and brought to the police station that petitioner conveniently remembered Contreras trying to hit him with a pipe. Such a vital information could not have escaped the petitioner's mind. We are thus inclined to believe that the alleged actuation of Contreras, which could have justified petitioner's shooting him, was nothing but a concocted story to evade criminal liability. Indeed, knowing that he shot Contreras, the least that the petitioner should have done was to bring with him to the police station the very pipe with which Contreras tried to attack him. As borne by the evidence, however, it was only after a police investigator referred to the scene that the lead pipe surfaced.Petitioner would likewise argue that the testimony of prosecution witness Ayson was incredible and riddled with inconsistencies.The alleged contradictions cited by the petitioner, i.e. where the victim was shot, where he died, and as to whether Ayson left his house after the shooting incident, are but minor details which do not affect Ayson's credibility. We have held time and again that few discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness referring to minor details and not in actuality touching upon the central fact of the crime, do not impair his credibility. Quite the contrary, such minor inconsistencies even tend to strengthen credibility because they discount the possibility that the testimony was rehearsed.[9]For sure, the record reveals that Ayson's answers to the questions propounded by the defense counsel are clear and categorical. As to where the victim died, Ayson clarified that the victim was already at the rooftop even before the arrival of the police officers. As to why he was not able to warn Mamangun that the victim was his relative, Ayson explained that he was not able to utter any word because when Contreras said \"Hindi ako. Hindi ako,\" petitioner suddenly fired at the latter.[10] As to the claim that Ayson was also on the roof, record shows that the robbery-holdup happened at around 8:00 in the evening. Before the policemen arrived, Ayson and Contreras were already pursuing the robber.[11] Ayson also testified that when the victim was shot by the petitioner, the former fell on his left side unconscious; that he did not leave his house after the incident because he was afraid that the policemen would detain him.[12]Self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, cannot be appreciated as a valid justifying circumstance in this case. For, from the above admitted, uncontroverted or established facts, the most important element of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim to justify a claim of self defense was absent. Lacking this essential and primary element of unlawful aggression, petitioner's plea of self-defense, complete or incomplete, must have to fail.To be sure, acts in the fulfillment of a duty, without more, do not completely justify the petitioner's firing the fatal gunshot at the victim. True, petitioner, as one of the policemen responding to a reported robbery then in progress, was performing his duty as a police officer as well as when he was trying to effect the arrest of the suspected robber and in the process, fatally shoot said suspect, albeit the wrong man. However, in the absence of the equally necessary justifying circumstance that the injury or offense committed be the necessary consequence of the due performance of such duty, there can only be incomplete justification, a privileged mitigating circumstance under Articles 13 and 69 of the Revised Penal Code.There can be no quibbling that there was no rational necessity for the killing of Contreras. Petitioner could have first fired a warning shot before pulling the trigger against Contreras who was one of the residents chasing the suspected robber.All told, we find no reversible error committed by the Sandiganbayan in convicting the petitioner of the crime of Homicide attended by the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete justifying circumstance of having acted in the performance of his duty as a policeman and the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.IN VIEW WHEREOF, the instant petition is DENIED and the assailed decision of the Sandiganbayan is AFFIRMED in all respects.No pronouncement as to costs.SO ORDERED.Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Nicodemo T.

Mamangun, a public officer, being then a Police Officer (PO2), duly appointed as such and acting in relation to his office, armed with a gun, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, attack, assault and shoot one Gener M.

On arraignment, petitioner, as accused below, duly assisted by a counsel de oficio , entered a plea of \"Not Guilty.\"\n\nIn the ensuing trial, the prosecution presented in evidence the testimonies of Crisanto Ayson (Ayson), an alleged eyewitness, and Dr. Benito Caballero, then the designated Medico-Legal Officer of Bulacan who performed an autopsy on the cadaver of the victim.\n\nFor its part, the defense adduced in evidence the testimonies of the accused himself, Rufino Mamangun, his co-policemen at the Philippine National Police (PNP), namely, PO2 Carlito Cruz, PO4 Hobert O. Diaz and Police Investigator SPO-1 Hernando B. Banez, all assigned at the Meycauayan Police Station; and those of Lorenzo S. Abacan and Rogelio Ingco, son and son-in-law, respectively, of Antonio Abacan, owner of the house on which rooftop the shooting of the victim took place.\n\nIt is not disputed that on July 31, 1992, at about 8:00 in the evening, in Brgy. Calvario, Meycauayan, Bulacan a certain Liberty Contreras was heard shouting, \"Magnanakaw...Magnanakaw.\" Several residents responded and thereupon chased the suspect who entered the yard of Antonio Abacan and proceeded to the rooftop of Abacan's house.\n\nAt about 9:00 o'clock that same evening, the desk officer of the Meycauayan PNP Police Station, upon receiving a telephone call that a robbery-holdup was in\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0progress in Brgy. Calvario, immediately contacted and dispatched to the scene the crew of Patrol Car No. 601 composed of Team Leader SPO1 Andres Legaspi, with PO2 Eugenio Aminas and herein petitioner PO2 Rufino S.

There, they saw a man whom they thought was the robbery suspect.\u00a0 At that instance, petitioner Mamangun, who was walking ahead of the group, fired his handgun once, hitting the man. The man turned out to be Gener Contreras (Contreras) who was not the robbery suspect.\n\nContreras died from the gunshot wound. The autopsy conducted by Dr. Benito B. Caballero yielded the following findings:\nThe cause of death was \"Shock due to massive external and internal hemorrhage due to multiple gunshot wounds in the left arm side of the thorax, penetrating the left lung and vertebral column.\" There were several wounds caused by one (1) bullet.\n\nAs shown on the sketch of human body attached to the Certificate of Death, and as testified on by Dr. Caballero, the bullet entered through the \"lower third of the left arm, left side of the thorax and it penetrated the left lung and vertebral column and that is where the slug was found.\"\u00a0 From a layman's appreciation of the sketch, the bullet entered the outer, upper left arm of the victim, exited through the inner side of the said upper left arm, a little lower than the left armpit and the slug lodging on the victim's back where it was recovered at the vertebral column. [3] From the foregoing admitted or undisputed facts, the prosecution and the defense presented conflicting versions as to how the fatal shooting of Contreras by petitioner Mamangun actually happened.\n\nAccording to Ayson, the lone eyewitness for the prosecution, he accompanied the three policemen (Mamangun, Diaz and Cruz) to the rooftop of Abacan's house.\u00a0 He was following petitioner Mamangun who was ahead of the group. They passed through the second-floor door of the house to the rooftop.\u00a0 The roof was lighted by an incandescent bulb from an adjacent house.\u00a0 He was beside Mamangun when they saw, some four to five arms-length away, a man whom he (witness) recognized as Gener Contreras.\u00a0 Mamangun pointed his .45 cal. pistol at the man, who instantly exclaimed, \"Hindi ako, hindi ako!,\" to which Mamangun replied, \"Anong hindi ako?\" Before he (Ayson) could say anything, Mamangun fired his gun, hitting the man who turned out to be Contreras.\u00a0 He \u00a0(witness) approached the victim who was then lying on his left side unconscious. \u00a0He brought down the victim and they rushed him to the hospital where he died at about 10:00 o'clock that same evening.\n\nThe defense has its own account of what purportedly actually\u00a0 transpired.\n\nPO2 Mamangun, along with PO2 Cruz and PO2Diaz, denied the presence of Ayson at the rooftop during the shooting incident. \u00a0Corroborating one another, the three testified that they were the only ones at the scene of the shooting, and that it was dark.\u00a0 They claimed that each of them, with Mamangun on the lead, went on separate directions around a water tank. As they met each other at the other side of the tank, PO2 Cruz pointed to a person crouching at the edge of the roof of the garage. Thinking that the person was the suspect they were looking for, Mamangun chased said person. They announced that they were police officers but the person continued to run in a crouching position until Mamangun caught up with him and shouted, \"Pulis. Tigil,\" whereupon the person suddenly stopped, turned around, faced Mamangun, and raised a stainless steel pipe towards the latter's head but Mamangun was able to evade the attack. This prompted Mamangun to shoot the person on the left arm.\u00a0 All three claimed that it was only at this point that PO2 Cruz and Diaz approached Contreras who told them, \"Hindi ako. Hindi ako.\" Mamangun went near Contreras and asked, \"Why did you go to the rooftop? You know there are policemen here.\" Contreras was thereafter brought to the hospital where he died. After the shooting incident, Mamangun reported the same to the desk officer, POI Filomeno de Luna, who advised him to remain in the police station. De Luna directed Police Investigator Hernando Banez to investigate the incident. That same evening, Investigator Banez went to the place where the shooting happened.\u00a0 Banez allegedly found a steel pipe about three (3) feet long on the depressed portion of the roof.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, after due proceedings, the Sandiganbayan came out with its decision [4] finding the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of only the crime of Homicide. In so finding, the Sandiganbayan did not appreciate the presence of the aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength to qualify the killing to Murder.\u00a0 But even as the said court rejected the petitioner's claim that the shooting was justified by self-defense, it nonetheless ruled that the crime of Homicide was attended by an incomplete justifying circumstance of the petitioner having acted in the performance of his duty as a policeman, and also appreciated in his favor the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Dispositively, the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the accused, RUFINO S. MAMANGUN, is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide, defined and penalized under Article 249, Revised Penal Code, and taking into account the attendance of one (1) privileged mitigation\u00a0 (sic) circumstance, one generic circumstance and no aggravating circumstance, he is hereby sentenced under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of from Three (3) Years and Three (3) Months of prision correctional as minimum, to Seven (7) years of prision mayor , as maximum, to indemnify the heirs (parents) of Gener Contreras in the total amount of P352,025.00, and to past the costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. Unable to accept the judgment of conviction, petitioner is now with this Court via the present recourse alleging that the Sandiganbayan committed reversible error in failing to apply paragraph 5, Article 11, of the Revised Penal Code, which would\u00a0 have absolved him from criminal liability on the basis of his submission that the shooting in question was done in the performance of a duty or in the lawful exercise of a right or office.\n\nFirst off, petitioner insists that the shooting, which ultimately caused the demise of Contreras, was justified because he was repelling Contreras' unlawful attack on his person, as Contreras \u00a0was then about to strike him on the head with a steel pipe.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nWell-settled is the rule that factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are conclusive upon the Court except where: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts and the findings of fact are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record. [5] None of these exceptions obtains in this case.\n\nHaving admitted [6] the fatal shooting of Contreras on the night of July 31, 1992, petitioner is charged with the burden of adducing convincing evidence to show that the killing was done in the fulfillment of his duty as a policeman.\n\nThe justifying circumstance of fulfillment of duty under paragraph 5, Article II, of the Revised Penal Code may be invoked only after the defense successfully proves that: (1) the accused acted in the performance of a duty; and (2) the\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0injury inflicted or offense committed is the necessary consequence of the due performance or lawful exercise of such duty. [7]\n\nConcededly, the first requisite is present in this case. Petitioner, a police officer, was responding to a robbery-holdup incident.\u00a0 His presence at the situs of the crime was in accordance with the performance of his duty. However, proof that the shooting and ultimate death of Contreras was a necessary consequence of the due performance of his duty as a policeman is essential to exempt him from criminal liability.\n\nAs we see it, petitioner's posturing that he shot Contreras because the latter tried to strike him with a steel pipe was a mere afterthought to exempt him from criminal liability.\n\nWe see no plausible basis to depart from the Sandiganbayan's findings that there was no reason for the petitioner to shoot Contreras. The latter was unarmed and had already uttered, \"Hindi po ako, Hindi po ako\" before the petitioner fatally shot him on the left arm. Prosecution witness Ayson, who was then behind the petitioner when the latter shot Contreras, testified that to the victim's utterances, the petitioner even responded, \"Anong hindi ako,\" and immediately shot Contreras. [8] As correctly observed by the Sandiganbayan:\nBesides being self-serving (with respect to the accused) and biased (with respect to his co-policemen-witnesses), We find (1) the claim of the accused and his co-policemen-witnesses that the victim (Contreras) attacked the said accused and (2) their seemingly \"positive\" identification of the stainless steel pipe (more of a rod) as his weapon, to be of doubtful credibility, for the following reasons:\n\n(1) We have no doubt that, as claimed by PO2 Carlito Cruz and PO2 Hobert Diaz, the three policemen appropriately identified themselves as police officers as they started chasing the man they saw \"crouching,\" and, as claimed by accused PO2 Rufino Mamangun, that, as he was about to catch up with said man, he shouted, \"Pulis!\u00a0 Tigil!\"\u00a0 With all these introductions and forewarnings, it is utterly incredible and contrary to human experience that, that man, later identified to be Gener Contreras and admittedly not the person they were looking for, purportedly armed only with a stainless steel \"lead\" pipe (more of a rod) would suddenly stop, turn around and attack one of the three policemen who were chasing him, one after the other, with drawn guns.\n\n(2) When the victim (Gener Contreras) fell down after being shot by accused PO2 Mamangun, and as the latter went near the fallen victim, said accused asked, \"Why did you go to the rooftop.\u00a0 You know\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0there are policemen here.\"\u00a0 He admits that he did not ask the victim, \"Why did you try to hit me, if you are not the one?\"\u00a0 This admission clearly belies the claim of the police-witnesses that Gener Contreras attacked the accused policeman with an iron pipe when he was shot, for the accused should have asked the latter question.\n\n(3) The location of the entry of the bullet fired by accused Mamangun which is at the outer left arm at about the bicep of the victim and its trajectory as it penetrated his body hitting his vital organs along the way belies the claim of the accused that the victim was facing him and had just missed his head with an iron pipe, as instead the victim must have instinctively shielded his body with his left arm. Moreover, petitioner's pretense that Contreras struck him with a steel pipe is intriguing. As it is, petitioner did not report the same to Police Investigator Banez when he reported back to the police station after the shooting incident. It was only when a lead pipe was recovered from the scene and brought to the police station that petitioner conveniently remembered Contreras trying to hit him with a pipe. \u00a0Such a vital information\u00a0 could not have escaped the petitioner's mind. We are thus inclined to believe that the alleged actuation of Contreras, which could have justified petitioner's shooting him, was nothing but a concocted story to evade criminal liability.\u00a0 Indeed, knowing that he shot Contreras, the least that the petitioner should have done was to bring with him to the police station the very pipe with which Contreras tried to attack him. As borne by the evidence, however, it was only after a police investigator referred to the scene that the lead pipe surfaced.\n\nPetitioner\u00a0 would likewise argue that the testimony of prosecution witness Ayson was incredible and riddled with inconsistencies.\n\nThe alleged contradictions cited by the petitioner, i.e. where the \u00a0victim was shot, where he died, and as to whether\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ayson left his house after the shooting incident, are but minor details which do not affect Ayson's credibility. We have held time and again that few discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness referring to minor details and not in actuality touching upon the central fact of the crime, do not impair his credibility. Quite the contrary, such minor inconsistencies even tend to strengthen credibility because they discount the possibility that the testimony was rehearsed. [9]\n\nFor sure, the record reveals that Ayson's answers to the questions propounded by the defense counsel are clear and categorical. As to where the \u00a0victim \u00a0died, \u00a0Ayson \u00a0clarified \u00a0that \u00a0the victim was already at the rooftop \u00a0even \u00a0before \u00a0the \u00a0arrival of the police officers. As to why he was not able to warn Mamangun that the victim was his relative, Ayson explained \u00a0that \u00a0he \u00a0was \u00a0not \u00a0able \u00a0to \u00a0utter any word because when Contreras said \"Hindi ako. Hindi ako,\" petitioner suddenly fired at the latter. [10] As \u00a0to \u00a0the \u00a0claim \u00a0that \u00a0Ayson \u00a0was \u00a0also \u00a0on \u00a0the \u00a0roof, record shows that the robbery-holdup happened at around 8:00 in the evening. Before the policemen arrived, Ayson and Contreras were already pursuing the robber. [11] Ayson also testified that when the victim was shot by the petitioner, the former fell on his left side unconscious; that he did not leave his house after the incident because he was afraid that the policemen would detain him. [12]\n\nSelf-defense, whether complete or incomplete, cannot be appreciated as a valid justifying circumstance in this case. For, from the above admitted, uncontroverted or established facts, the most important element of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim to justify a claim of self defense was absent.\u00a0 Lacking this essential and primary element of unlawful aggression, petitioner's plea of self-defense, complete or incomplete, must have to fail.\n\nTo be sure, acts in the fulfillment of a duty , without more, do not completely justify the petitioner's firing the fatal gunshot at the victim.\u00a0 True, \u00a0petitioner, \u00a0as \u00a0one \u00a0of \u00a0the policemen responding to a reported robbery \u00a0then \u00a0in progress, was performing his duty as a police officer as well as when he was trying to effect the arrest of the suspected robber and in the process, fatally shoot said suspect, albeit the wrong man.\u00a0 However, in the absence of the equally necessary justifying circumstance\u00a0 that the injury or offense committed be the necessary consequence of the due performance of such duty, there can only be incomplete justification, a privileged mitigating circumstance under Articles 13 and 69 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nThere can be no quibbling that there was no rational necessity for the killing of Contreras.\u00a0 Petitioner could have first fired a warning shot before pulling the trigger against Contreras who was one of the residents chasing the suspected robber.\n\nAll \u00a0told, we find no reversible error committed by the Sandiganbayan in \u00a0convicting\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0the \u00a0petitioner \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0crime \u00a0of \u00a0Homicide \u00a0attended \u00a0by \u00a0the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete justifying circumstance of having acted in the performance of his duty as a policeman and the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.\n\nIN VIEW WHEREOF, the instant petition is DENIED and\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0the assailed decision of the Sandiganbayan is AFFIRMED in all respects.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Nicodemo T.

      "title": "GERARDO CASTILLO, PETITIONER, VS.COURT OF APPEALS, NIGADERIO PANGILINAN, TRANQUILINO CUA AND JULIANA FRANCISCO PAJOTA, RESPONDENTS. DECISION QUISUMBING, J.: Sought to be annulled in this petition for certiorari are the Decision[1] dated November 6, 2003, and the Resolution[2] dated January 16, 2004, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79271, which affirmed the decision[3] dated January 10, 2001, of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) in DARAB Case No. 7805.The following are the antecedent facts culled from the records:Juliana F. Pajota is the registered owner of an agricultural land situated at Gapan, Nueva Ecija and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. NT-55353 of the Registry of Deeds of Nueva Ecija.[4] On August 28, 1993, Pajota appointed Tranquilino Cua as her attorney-in-fact to negotiate with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation for the cancellation of a real estate mortgage on the land. On December 5, 1994, Pajota leased the land to petitioner Gerardo Castillo as evidenced by a Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan.[5]On December 8, 1995, a Deed of Cancellation of Mortgage and a Deed of Absolute Sale dated September 28, 1995,[6] in favor of respondent Nigaderio Pangilinan, were presented simultaneously before the Registry of Deeds of Nueva Ecija. Thereafter, the mortgage and TCT No. NT-55353 were cancelled. A new TCT, No. NT-245286,[7] was issued in Pangilinan's name.Castillo alleged that when he visited the land on January 27, 1996, he was driven away by Pangilinan and Cua. He also discovered that the land was already fenced with wooden posts and barbed wire. Castillo reported the incident to the Philippine National Police Station in Gapan, Nueva Ecija.[8]Castillo also alleged that upon learning of the sale, he sent a letter dated April 9, 1996[9] to Pangilinan demanding that he vacate the property. He sent another letter dated April 16, 1996[10] informing Pangilinan that he was exercising his right of redemption. He also tendered a payment of P50,000 which he deposited with Security Bank, Gapan Branch. On May 13, 1996, the money was consigned with the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator in Cabanatuan City.[11]Also on May 13, 1996, Castillo filed before the provincial adjudicator a Petition for Redemption and Ejectment docketed as DARAB Case No. 01710'SNE\"96.[12] On December 29, 1997, the provincial adjudicator dismissed the case on the ground that Castillo had no cause of action against Pangilinan since he was not the latter's tenant.[13] Instead he should have impleaded Pajota and Cua.On reconsideration and after Castillo impleaded Pajota and Cua, the provincial adjudicator reversed his decision.[14] He ruled that Castillo was a tenant entitled to exercise the right of redemption under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844.The respondents appealed to the DARAB which reversed the ruling of the provincial adjudicator in a new judgment, as follows:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Order dated 15 June 1998 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. A new judgment is hereby rendered:1) Declaring plaintiff-appellee not a bona fide tenant over the property in suit;2) Declaring plaintiff-appellee ineligible to avail of the right of redemption granted under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844;3) Ordering the maintenance of respondents-appellants in peaceful possession of the landholding.All previous injunctive reliefs and orders issued by the Adjudicator a quo inconsistent with this decision is (sic) hereby NULLIFIED.SO ORDERED.[15]The DARAB ruled that only a bona fide tenant who cultivates the land himself and with the aid available from his immediate farm household may exercise the right of redemption granted by Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 3844. Based on the records, Castillo was gainfully employed as a manager of Warner Lambert Philippines during the period when he should have been cultivating the land. Thus, he could not have cultivated the land himself as his employment required him to report for office work regularly.Castillo moved for reconsideration but the DARAB denied it.[16] He then filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals, seeking to set aside the decision and resolution of the DARAB. On November 6, 2003, the appellate court dismissed the petition.[17]The appellate court reiterated that only bona fide tenants may avail of the right of redemption. To be a bona fide tenant, the person must cultivate the land himself and with the aid available from his immediate farm household. The appellate court sustained the DARAB's observation that Castillo's employment with Warner Lambert Philippines debunked the existence of a tenancy relationship. It also disregarded Castillo's contention that he was merely augmenting his income since his employment preceded his leasehold contract with Pajota.His motion for reconsideration having been denied, Castillo filed this petition where he avers that the Court of Appeals erred in deciding in a way not in accord with law and applicable jurisprudence, and committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and/or excess of jurisdiction when:I.It sustained the DARAB ruling that petitioner is not a tenant and could not possibly satisfy the requirement of personal cultivation by reason of his employment. As such, petitioner can not enjoy the right of redemption granted by Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844 which is extended only to bona fide tenants of agricultural lands;II.It failed to consider the fact that petitioner and the former owner has a valid and existing agricultural tenancy contract and that the MARO - Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer certified to the fact that petitioner is actually managing and in actual physical possession of the agricultural land in question; andIII.It did not give credence to the nature and topography of the land in question, which is an unirrigated upland devoted to rice that is dependent only on rainwater for irrigation and suitable only for one (1) cropping. Hence, petitioner is not expected to work on the land all year round.[18]The issue for our resolution is whether the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and/or excess of jurisdiction in affirming the DARAB's ruling that Castillo is not a bona fide tenant.Castillo avers that he is a bona fide tenant in spite of his employment as a manager of Warner Lambert Philippines. While he does not deny that personal cultivation is an essential requisite for a tenancy relationship to exist, he contends that personal cultivation means cultivation by the lessee in person and/or with the aid of labor from within his immediate household. Therefore, he is allowed to engage the assistance of his immediate family members in tilling the land. He contends that not only did he personally cultivate the land, he also employed the help of his sons. Additionally, he invokes the Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan between himself and Pajota as well as the Certification issued by the OIC-Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of Gapan, Nueva Ecija[19] which recognized him as tenant of the land.After considering the submission of the parties, we find the instant petition bereft of merit.In synthesis, the petitioner is asking this Court to review the facts and the evidence in the instant case. But it is an established doctrine that a review of facts and evidence is not the province of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, which is extra ordinem - beyond the ambit of appeal.[20] Stated elsewise, factual matters, now being raised by the petitioner, cannot normally be inquired into by this Court in a certiorari proceeding. It cannot be tasked to go over the proofs presented by the parties and analyze, assess and weigh them again, in order to ascertain if the trial and the appellate courts were correct in according superior credit to the piece of evidence of one party or the other.[21]Nevertheless, even if this Court were to consider this case as an exception to the general rule so as to permit a factual review, we are in agreement just the same that the petition fails to show that the petitioner is a bona fide tenant.We note that in support of his claim of tenancy, the petitioner presented the Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan and the MARO Certification. In our view, however, these documents are insufficient to support the petitioner's claim of tenancy.To begin with, the agreement called Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan entered into by Pajota and the petitioner can not by itself prove that the petitioner is a bona fide tenant. To determine whether a tenancy relationship exists, the concurrence of all the following essential requisites must be established by substantial evidence: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; (2) the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; (3) there is consent between the parties to the relationship; (4) the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and (6) the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee.[22]In the case at bar, the element of personal cultivation by the petitioner was not proven. There is a dearth of evidence on record to show that the petitioner personally cultivated the lands. Much less was it shown that he was assisted by his sons in his farm work. This is fatal to the petitioner's cause as without the element of personal cultivation, a person cannot be considered a tenant even if he is so designated in the written agreement of the parties.[23] Also, the MARO Certification does not suffice to prove that the petitioner is a bona fide tenant. The certification merely indicated that the petitioner was managing and was in physical possession of the land since 1994.[24] It did not even refer to the petitioner as tenant of the land. In a previous case, we have ruled that certifications issued by administrative agencies and/or officials concerning tenancy relationship are preliminary and are not binding on the courts.[25]Thus, even if we review the evidence on record as prayed for by the petitioner, we are in agreement that the instant petition cannot be granted. No grave abuse of discretion could be ascribed to the decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79271.WHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is DISMISSED for utter lack of merit.SO ORDERED.Carpio, Carpio-Morales, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.[1] Rollo, pp. 18-27.

No. 161959, February 02, 2007 ]\n\nGERARDO CASTILLO, PETITIONER, VS.COURT OF APPEALS, NIGADERIO PANGILINAN, TRANQUILINO CUA AND JULIANA FRANCISCO PAJOTA, RESPONDENTS.\nDECISION\nGERARDO CASTILLO, PETITIONER, VS.COURT OF APPEALS, NIGADERIO PANGILINAN, TRANQUILINO CUA AND JULIANA FRANCISCO PAJOTA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nSought to be annulled in this petition for certiorari are the Decision [1] dated November 6, 2003, and the Resolution [2] dated January 16, 2004, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79271, which affirmed the decision [3] dated January 10, 2001, of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) in DARAB Case No. 7805.\n\nThe following are the antecedent facts culled from the records:\n\nJuliana F. Pajota is the registered owner of an agricultural land situated at Gapan, Nueva Ecija and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. NT-55353 of the Registry of Deeds of Nueva Ecija. [4] On August 28, 1993, Pajota appointed Tranquilino Cua as her attorney-in-fact to negotiate with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation for the cancellation of a real estate mortgage on the land.\u00a0 On December 5, 1994, Pajota leased the land to petitioner Gerardo Castillo as evidenced by a Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan . [5]\n\nOn December 8, 1995, a Deed of Cancellation of Mortgage and a Deed of Absolute Sale dated September 28, 1995, [6] in favor of respondent Nigaderio Pangilinan, were presented simultaneously before the Registry of Deeds of Nueva Ecija. \u00a0Thereafter, the mortgage and TCT No. NT-55353 were cancelled.\u00a0 A new TCT, No. NT-245286, [7] was issued in Pangilinan's name.\n\nCastillo alleged that when he visited the land on January 27, 1996, he was driven away by Pangilinan and Cua. \u00a0He also discovered that the land was already fenced with wooden posts and barbed\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0wire.\u00a0 Castillo reported the incident to the Philippine National Police Station in Gapan, Nueva Ecija. [8]\n\nCastillo also alleged that upon learning of the sale, he sent a letter dated April 9, 1996 [9] to Pangilinan demanding that he vacate the property.\u00a0 He sent another letter dated April 16, 1996 [10] informing Pangilinan that he was exercising his right of redemption. \u00a0He also tendered a payment of P50,000 which he deposited with Security Bank, Gapan Branch. \u00a0On May 13, 1996, the money was consigned with the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator in Cabanatuan City. [11]\n\nAlso on May 13, 1996, Castillo filed before the provincial adjudicator a Petition for Redemption and Ejectment docketed as DARAB Case No. 01710'SNE\"96. [12] On December 29, 1997, the provincial adjudicator dismissed the case on the ground that Castillo had no cause of action against Pangilinan since he was not the latter's tenant. [13] Instead he should have impleaded Pajota and Cua.\n\nOn reconsideration and after Castillo impleaded Pajota and Cua, the provincial adjudicator reversed his decision. [14] He ruled that Castillo was a tenant entitled to exercise the right of redemption under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844.\n\nThe respondents appealed to the DARAB which reversed the ruling of the provincial adjudicator in a new judgment, as follows:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Order dated 15 June 1998 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE .\u00a0 A new judgment is hereby rendered:\n\n1) Declaring plaintiff-appellee not a bona fide tenant over the property in suit;\n\n2) Declaring plaintiff-appellee ineligible to avail of the right of redemption granted under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844;\n\n3) Ordering the maintenance of respondents-appellants in peaceful possession of the landholding.\n\nAll previous injunctive reliefs and orders issued by the Adjudicator a quo inconsistent with this decision is (sic) hereby NULLIFIED .\n\nSO ORDERED. [15] The DARAB ruled that only a bona fide tenant who cultivates the land himself and with the aid available from his immediate farm household may exercise the right of redemption granted by Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 3844.\u00a0 Based on the records, Castillo was gainfully employed as a manager of Warner Lambert Philippines during the period when he should have been cultivating the land. \u00a0Thus, he could not have cultivated the land himself as his employment required him to report for office work regularly.\n\nCastillo moved for reconsideration but the DARAB denied it. [16] He then filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals, seeking to set aside the decision and resolution of the DARAB. \u00a0On November 6, 2003, the appellate court dismissed the petition. [17]\n\nThe appellate court reiterated that only bona fide tenants may avail of the right of redemption. \u00a0To be a bona fide tenant, the person must cultivate the land himself and with the aid available from his immediate farm household. \u00a0The appellate court sustained the DARAB's observation that Castillo's employment with Warner Lambert Philippines debunked the existence of a tenancy relationship. \u00a0It also disregarded Castillo's contention that he was merely augmenting his income since his employment preceded his leasehold contract with Pajota.\n\nHis motion for reconsideration having been denied, Castillo filed this petition where he avers that the Court of Appeals erred in deciding in a way not in accord with law and applicable jurisprudence, and committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and/or excess of jurisdiction when:\nI.\n\nIt sustained the DARAB ruling that petitioner is not a tenant and could not possibly satisfy the requirement of personal cultivation by reason of his employment.\u00a0 As such, petitioner can not enjoy the right of redemption granted by Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844 which is extended only to bona fide tenants of agricultural lands;\n\nII.\n\nIt failed to consider the fact that petitioner and the former owner has a valid and existing agricultural tenancy contract and that the MARO - Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer certified to the fact that petitioner is actually managing and in actual physical possession of the agricultural land in question; and\n\nIII.\n\nIt did not give credence to the nature and topography of the land in question, which is an unirrigated upland devoted to rice that is dependent only on rainwater for irrigation and suitable only for one (1) cropping.\u00a0 Hence, petitioner is not expected to work on the land all year round. [18] The issue for our resolution is whether the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and/or excess of jurisdiction in affirming the DARAB's ruling that Castillo is not a bona fide tenant.\n\nCastillo avers that he is a bona fide tenant in spite of his employment as a manager of Warner Lambert Philippines. \u00a0While he does not deny that personal cultivation is an essential requisite for a tenancy relationship to exist, he contends that personal cultivation means cultivation by the lessee in person and/or with the aid of labor from within his immediate household. \u00a0Therefore, he is allowed to engage the assistance of his immediate family members in tilling the land. \u00a0He contends that not only did he personally cultivate the land, he also employed the help of his sons. \u00a0Additionally, he invokes the Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan between himself and Pajota as well as the Certification issued by the OIC-Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of Gapan, Nueva Ecija [19] which recognized him as tenant of the land.\n\nAfter considering the submission of the parties, we find the instant petition bereft of merit.\n\nIn synthesis, the petitioner is asking this Court to review the facts and the evidence in the instant case. \u00a0But it is an established doctrine that a review of facts and evidence is not the province of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari , which is extra ordinem - beyond the ambit of appeal. [20] Stated elsewise, factual matters, now being raised by the petitioner, cannot normally be inquired into by this Court in a certiorari proceeding.\u00a0 It cannot be tasked to go over the proofs presented by the parties and analyze, assess and weigh them again, in order to ascertain if the trial and the appellate courts were correct in according superior credit to the piece of evidence of one party or the other. [21]\n\nNevertheless, even if this Court were to consider this case as an exception to the general rule so as to permit a factual review, we are in agreement just the same that the petition fails to show that the petitioner is a bona fide tenant.\n\nWe note that in support of his claim of tenancy, the petitioner presented the Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan and the MARO Certification. \u00a0In our view, however, these documents are insufficient to support the petitioner's claim of tenancy.\n\nTo begin with, the agreement called Kasunduan Buwisan sa Sakahan entered into by Pajota and the petitioner can not by itself prove that the petitioner is a bona fide tenant.\u00a0 To determine whether a tenancy relationship exists, the concurrence of all the following essential requisites must be established by substantial evidence: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; (2) the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; (3) there is consent between the parties to the relationship; (4) the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee ; and (6) the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee. [22]\n\nIn the case at bar, the element of personal cultivation by the petitioner was not proven. \u00a0There is a dearth of evidence on record to show that the petitioner personally cultivated the lands. \u00a0Much less was it shown that he was assisted by his sons in his farm work.\u00a0 This is fatal to the petitioner's cause as without the element of personal cultivation, a person cannot be considered a tenant even if he is so designated in the written agreement of the parties. [23] Also, the MARO Certification does not suffice to prove that the petitioner is a bona fide tenant. \u00a0The certification merely indicated that the petitioner was managing and was in physical possession of the land since 1994. [24] It did not even refer to the petitioner as tenant of the land. \u00a0In a previous case, we have ruled that certifications issued by administrative agencies and/or officials concerning tenancy relationship are preliminary and are not binding on the courts. [25]\n\nThus, even if we review the evidence on record as prayed for by the petitioner, we are in agreement that the instant petition cannot be granted.\u00a0 No grave abuse of discretion could be ascribed to the decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79271.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is DISMISSED for utter lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, Carpio-Morales, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 18-27.

NO. 129928, August 25, 2005 ]\n\nMISAMIS OCCIDENTAL II COOPERATIVE, INC., PETITIONER, VS. VIRGILIO S. DAVID, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nMISAMIS OCCIDENTAL II COOPERATIVE, INC., PETITIONER, VS. VIRGILIO S. DAVID, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nIn this Petition for Review [1] under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, petitioner Misamis Occidental II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (hereinafter, MOELCI II) seeks the reversal of the Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals, Former Ninth Division in C.A. G.R. SP No. 41626 and its Resolution [3] denying MOELCI II's motion for reconsideration. The questioned Decision dismissed MOELCI II's petition for certiorari under Rule 65 and effectively affirmed the trial court's orders dated 16 November 1995 [4] and 13 March 1996 [5] which respectively denied petitioner's Motion (For Preliminary Hearing of Affirmative Defenses and Deferment of Pre-Trial Conference) [6] and Motion for Reconsideration . [7]\n\nThe antecedents are as follows:\n\nPrivate respondent Virgilio S. David (hereinafter, David), a supplier of electrical hardware, [8] filed a case for specific performance and damages against MOELCI II, a rural electric cooperative in Misamis Occidental, docketed as Civil Case No. 94-69402 entitled \" Virgilio David v. Misamis Occidental II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (MOELCI II). \" The said case, which was essentially a collection suit, pending before Judge Felixberto Olalia (hereinafter, Judge Olalia) of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 8 (the trial court), was predicated on a document attached as Annex \"A\" to the Amended Complaint [9] that according to David is the contract pursuant to which he sold to MOELCI II one (1) unit of 10 MVA Transformer. [10]\n\nMOELCI II filed its Answer to Amended Complaint [11] which pleaded, among others, affirmative defenses which also constitute grounds for dismissal of the complaint. These grounds were lack of cause of action, there being allegedly no enforceable contract between David and MOELCI II under the Statute of Frauds pursuant to Section 1 (g) and (i), Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, and improper venue. [12]\n\nIn accordance with Section 5, Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, [13] (now Section 6, Rule 16 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure) MOELCI II filed with the trial court a Motion (For Preliminary Hearing of Affirmative Defenses and Deferment of Pre-Trial Conference) [14] (hereinafter referred to as Motion ). In said Motion , MOELCI II in essence argued that the document attached as Annex \"A\" to the Amended Complaint was only a quotation letter and not a contract as alleged by David. Thus, it contends that David's Amended Complaint is dismissible for failure to state a cause of action. [15]\n\nIn his opposition to MOELCI II's Motion , David contended in the main that because a motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to state a cause of action is required to be based only on the allegations of the complaint, the \"quotation letter,\" being merely an attachment to the complaint and not part of its allegations, cannot be inquired into. [16]\n\nMOELCI II filed a rejoinder to the opposition in which it asserted, citing extensively the ruling of the Court in World Wide Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. v. Macrohon , [17] that a complaint cannot be separated from its annexes; hence, the trial court in resolving a motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to state a cause of action must consider the complaint's annexes. [18]\n\nAfter the parties filed their respective memoranda, Judge Olalia issued an order dated 16 November 1995 denying MOELCI II's motion for preliminary hearing of affirmative defenses. MOELCI II's motion for reconsideration of the said order was likewise denied in another order issued by Judge Olalia on 13 March 1996. [19]\n\nMOELCI II elevated this incident to the Court of Appeals by way of a special civil action for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Olalia in the issuance of the two aforesaid orders.\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Court of Appeals dismissed MOELCI II's petition holding that the allegations in David's complaint constitute a cause of action. With regard to MOELCI II's contention that David's Amended Complaint is dismissible as the document, attached thereto as Annex \"A,\" upon which David's claim is based is not a contract of sale but rather a quotation letter, the Court of Appeals ruled that the interpretation of the document requires evidence aliunde which is not allowed in determining whether or not the complaint states a cause of action. The appellate court further declared that when the trial court is confronted with a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of cause of action, it is mandated to confine its examination for the resolution thereof to the allegations of the complaint and is specifically enjoined from receiving evidence for that purpose. [20]\n\nWith the denial of its Motion for Reconsideration , petitioner is now before this Court seeking a review of the appellate court's pronouncements. MOELCI II asserts that the Court of Appeals committed serious error in: (1) ruling that the resolution of its motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of cause of action necessitated hearings by the trial court with the end in view of determining whether or not the document attached as Annex \"A\" to the Amended Complaint is a contract as alleged in the body of said pleading; and (2) not ordering the trial court to dismiss the Amended Complaint on the ground of lack of cause of action. [21] Anent the first ground, MOELCI II further claims that with the denial of its Petition , the appellate court in effect exhorted the trial court to defer the resolution of its motion to dismiss until after the hearing of the case on the merits contrary to Rule 16 [22] of the Rules of Court and well-settled jurisprudence. [23]\n\nIn his comment, [24] David counters that a sufficient cause of action exists. He also points out that he and MOELCI II differ in the interpretation of the construction of the document attached as Annex \"A\" of the Amended Complaint ; hence, there is a need to conduct hearings thereon. He likewise contends that the trial court did not defer the resolution of petitioner's motion to dismiss. On the contrary, the trial court denied squarely the motion \"to abbreviate the proceedings and for the parties to proceed to trial and avoid piece meal resolution of issues.\" [25]\n\nIn its Reply , [26] MOELCI II reiterates its position that the document attached as Annex \"A\" of the Amended Complaint clearly is a quotation letter and not a perfected contract of sale as alleged by David. The absence of doubt or ambiguity of the contents and import of the document leaves no room for its interpretation.\n\nAt issue is whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari and in holding that the trial court did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's Motion .\n\nWe find no error in the ruling of the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn Municipality of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna v. Court of Appeals , [27] decided under the old Rules of Court, we held that a preliminary hearing permitted under Section 5, Rule 16, is not mandatory even when the same is prayed for. It rests largely on the sound discretion of the court, thus:\nSEC. 5. Pleading grounds as affirmative defenses .- Any of the grounds for dismissal provided for in this rule, except improper venue, may be pleaded as an affirmative defense, and a preliminary hearing may be had thereon as if a motion to dismiss had been filed.\nThe use of the word \"may\" in the aforequoted provision shows that such a hearing is not mandatory but discretionary. It is an auxiliary verb indicating liberty, opportunity, permission and possibility. [28]\n\nSuch interpretation is now specifically expressed in the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Section 6, Rule 16 provides that a grant of preliminary hearing rests on the sound discretion of the court, to wit-\nSEC. 6. Pleading grounds as affirmative defenses .- If no motion to dismiss has been filed, any of the grounds for dismissal provided for in this Rule may be pleaded as an affirmative defense in the answer and, in the discretion of the court, a preliminary hearing may be had thereon as if a motion to dismiss had been filed.\n\n. . .\nBased on the foregoing, a preliminary hearing undeniably is subject to the discretion of the trial court. Absent any showing that the trial court had acted without jurisdiction or in excess thereof or with such grave abuse of discretion as would amount to lack of jurisdiction, as in the present case, the trial court's order granting or dispensing with the need for a preliminary hearing may not be corrected by certiorari. [29]\n\nMoreover, consistent with our ruling in The Heirs of Juliana Clavano v. Genato , [30] as MOELCI II's Motion is anchored on the ground that the Complaint allegedly stated no cause of action, a preliminary hearing thereon is more than unnecessary as it constitutes an erroneous and improvident move. No error therefore could be ascribed to the trial court in the denial of such Motion . The Court ruled in the cited case, thus:\n. . . . respondent Judge committed an error in conducting a preliminary hearing on the private respondent's affirmative defenses. It is a well-settled rule that in a motion to dismiss based on the ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, the question submitted to the court for determination is the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint itself. Whether those allegations are true or not is beside the point, for their truth is hypothetically admitted by the motion. The issue rather is: admitting them to be true, may the court render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer of the complaint? Stated otherwise, the sufficiency of the cause of action must appear on the face of the complaint in order to sustain a dismissal on this ground. No extraneous matter may be considered nor facts not alleged, which would require evidence and therefore must be raised as defenses and await the trial. In other words, to determine the sufficiency of the cause of action, only the facts alleged in the complaint, and no other should be considered.\n\nThe respondent Judge departed from this rule in conducting a hearing and in receiving evidence in support of the private respondent's affirmative defense, that is, lack of cause of action. [31]\nTo determine the existence of a cause of action, only the statements in the complaint may be properly considered. It is error for the court to take cognizance of external facts or hold preliminary hearings to determine their existence. If the allegations in a complaint furnish sufficient basis by which the complaint can be maintained, the same should not be dismissed regardless of the defenses that may be averred by the defendants. [32]\n\nThe test of sufficiency of facts alleged in the complaint as constituting a cause of action is whether or not admitting the facts alleged, the court could render a valid verdict in accordance with the prayer of said complaint. [33]\n\nIn the case at bar, the Amended Complaint states in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6, thus:\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\nOn June 8 1992 the parties entered into a contract for the sale by the plaintiff to the defendant of one (1) unit 10 MVA Power transformer with accessories for a total price of P5,200,000.00 plus 69 KV Line Accessories for a total price of P2,169,500.00 under the following relevant terms and conditions:\n\nFifty percent (50%) downpayment upon signing of contract.\nFifty percent (50%) upon delivery\n\nDelivery- Ninety (90) working days upon receipt of your Purchase Order and Downpayment Copy of the contract is hereto attached as Annex \"A.\"\n\nBecause of the standing relationship between the parties and the urgent need on the part of the defendant for the power transformer to remedy the electric supply deficiency in its area of coverage the plaintiff waived the 50% downpayment and delivered soon thereafter the 10 MVA transformer with accessories evidence (sic) by a copy of the sales invoice hereto attached as Annex \"B\".\n\nDespite demands however, verbal and written, since December 1992, the defendant has failed to pay the price thereof of P5,200,000.00 plus the custom duties and incidental expenses of P272,722.27.\n\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n\nApart from the above transaction, the plaintiff has been, on a regular basis, delivering various electrical hardware to the defendant which, as of 31 January 1994, despite demands, has an outstanding balance of P281,939.76. [34] And David prayed as follows:\nWHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment render ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff:\n\nON THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION The total sum of P5,472,722.27 plus the stipulated interest at 24% per annum from December 1992 until fully paid .\n\nON THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n\nThe balance of P281,939.76 plus the stipulated interest at 24% per annum from due dates until fully paid .\n\nCOMMON PROPER (sic)\n\nAttorney's fee at 25% of the foregoing amounts plus expenses of litigation and not less than P100,000.00 with costs.\n\nOther reliefs as may be just and equitable in the premises. [35]\nIt has been hypothetically admitted that the parties had entered into a contract sale David bound himself to supply MOELCI II (1) unit 10 MVA Power transformer with accessories for a total price of P5,200,000.00 plus 69 KV Line Accessories for a total price of P2,169,500.00; that despite written and verbal demands, MOELCI II has failed to pay the price thereof plus the custom duties and incidental expenses of P272,722.27; and that apart from the previously stated contract of sale, David regularly delivered various electrical hardware to MOELCI II which, despite demands, has an outstanding balance of P281,939.76.\n\nWe believe all the foregoing sufficiently lay out a cause of action. Even extending our scrutiny to Annex \"A,\" which is after all deemed a part of the Amended Complaint , will not result to a change in our conclusion.\n\nContrary to MOELCI II's assertion, Annex \"A\" is not an \"undisguised quotation letter.\" [36] While Annex \"A\" is captioned as such, the presence of the signatures of both the General Manager and the Chairman of the Committee of Management immediately below the word \"CONFORME\" appearing on the document's last page [37] lends credulity to David's contention that there was, or might have been, a meeting of minds on the terms embodied therein. Thus, the appendage of Annex \"A\" does not entirely serve to snuff out David's claims.\n\nIn fact, the ambiguity of the import and nature of Annex \"A\" which necessitates a resort to its proper interpretation, fortifies the propriety of the trial court's denial of MOELCI II's Motion . The interpretation of a document requires introduction of evidence which is precisely disallowed in determining whether or not a complaint states a cause of action. The Court of Appeals therefore correctly dismissed MOELCI II's petition and upheld the trial court's ruling.\n\nNow, whether in truth Annex \"A\" is, as entitled, a mere quotation letter is a matter that could best be proven during a full-blown hearing rather than through a preliminary hearing as this may involve extensive proof. Verily, where a preliminary hearing will not suffice, it is incumbent upon the trial court to deny a motion for preliminary hearing and go on to trial. The veracity of the assertions of the parties can be ascertained at the trial of the case on the merits. [38]\n\nFinally, we do not agree with MOELCI II's contention that the Court of Appeals sanctioned the trial court's deferment of the resolution of MOELCI II's Motion . The trial court squarely denied the Motion and not merely deferred its resolution. [39] Thus, there is no deferment to speak of that should be enjoined.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 14 March 1997 and its Resolution dated 14 July 1997 are AFFIRMED.

BENITO TUMAMAO, SCHOOLS DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT OF ISABELA, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF RUFINO DULAY, SR., REPRESENTED BY IGNACIA VICENTE, RUFINO DULAY, JR., SUSANA DULAY, ADELAIDA DULAY, LUZVIMINDA DULAY AND CECILIA DULAY, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review on certiorari of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 78314 which affirmed the Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Santiago City, Isabela, Branch 35, in Civil Case No. 35-2397.\n\nThe spouses Rufino Dulay, Sr. and Ignacia Vicente were the owners of a parcel of land located in Rizal, Santiago, Isabela, with an area of 29,002 square meters. The lot was covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-6776.\n\nOn August 3, 1981, the spouses Dulay executed a deed of donation [3] over a 10,000-square-meter portion of their property in favor of the Ministry of Education and Culture (now the Department of Education, Culture and Sports [DECS]). The deed provided, among others:\nThat for and in consideration of the benefits that may be derived from the use of the above described property which is intended for school purposes, the said DONORS do by by (sic) these presents TRANSFER AND CONVEY by way of DONATION unto the DONEE, its successors and assigns, the above property to become effective upon the signing of this document. [4] The property was subdivided. On April 13, 1983, Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-143337 [5] covering the portion identified as Lot 8858-A was issued in the name of the Ministry of Education and Culture, represented by Laurencio C. Ramel, the Superintendent of Schools of Isabela. However, the property was not used for school purposes and remained idle.\n\nSometime in 1988, the DECS, through its Secretary, started construction of the Rizal National High School building on a parcel of land it acquired from Alejandro Feliciano. The school site was about 2 kilometers away from the land donated by the spouses Dulay.\n\nIn a letter [6] to the DECS Secretary dated August 19, 1994, the spouses Dulay requested that the property be returned to them considering that the land was never used since 1981, or a period of more than 13 years. On August 28, 1994, the Barangay Council of Rizal, Santiago City issued Resolution No. 39 [7] recognizing the right of the donors to redeem the subject parcel of land because of the DECS' failure to utilize it for the intended purpose. It further resolved that the Rizal National High School no longer needed the donated land \"considering its distance from the main campus and [the] failure to utilize the property for a long period of time.\"\n\nOn December 22, 1994, Rufino Dulay, Sr. passed away at the age of 80. [8] His heirs sought the help of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Santiago City via an undated letter [9] requesting the approval of a resolution allowing them to redeem the donated property. The S angguniang Panlungsod denied the request inasmuch as the city government was not a party to the deed of donation. [10]\n\nOn August 31, 1997, the heirs of Dulay, Sr., herein respondents, filed a complaint for the revocation of the deed of donation and cancellation of TCT No. T-143337 before the RTC of Santiago City, Isabela, Branch 35, against the DECS Secretary and Dr. Benito Tumamao, the Schools Division Superintendent of Isabela. Respondents alleged that there was a condition in the deed of donation: that the DECS, as donee, utilize the subject property for school purposes, that is, the construction of a building to house the Rizal National High School. Respondents alleged that the DECS did not fulfill the condition and that the land remained idle up to the present. Respondents also averred that the donation inter vivos was inofficious, since the late Rufino Dulay, Sr. donated more than what he could give by will.\n\nPetitioners, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), interposed the following defenses: (a) the DECS complied with said condition because the land was being used by the school as its technology and home economics laboratory; (b) the donation was not inofficious for the donors were the owners of five other parcels of land, all located at Rizal, Santiago City; (c) the DECS acquired the disputed property by virtue of purchase made on December 8, 1997 by the barangay of Rizal, Santiago City in the amount of P18,000.00 as certified by its former Barangay Captain, Jesus San Juan; [11] and (d) the action of the respondents had prescribed. The OSG also claimed that students planted a portion of the land with rice, mahogany seedlings, and fruit-bearing trees; the produce would then be sold and the proceeds used for the construction of a school building on the subject property.\n\nIn their Reply, [12] respondents denied that the donated land was being used as a technology and home economics laboratory, and averred that there were no improvements on the property. Moreover, the fact that rice was planted on the lot was contrary to the intended purpose of the donation. The respondents likewise denied that the property had been sold to the barangay . While the other properties of the late donor had been sold, the deeds thereon had not been registered, and the tax declarations not yet transferred in the names of the purchasers.\n\nThereafter, trial ensued. On March 6, 2001, an ocular inspection of the property was conducted by the parties and their respective counsels, including the Presiding Judge. It was confirmed that the land was barren, save for a small portion which was planted with palay. A demolished house was also found in the periphery of the donated lot. [13]\n\nOn December 26, 2002, the trial court rendered its decision in favor of respondents. The fallo reads:\nWHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court hereby DECLARES the deed of donation, Exhibit \"A,\" executed by the late Rufino Dulay, Sr. and his wife Ignacia Vicente over a portion of the land covered by O.C.T. No. P-6776 and now covered by T.C.T. No. T-143337 in the name of the donee Department of Education and Culture as REVOKED. The defendant DECS is ORDERED to execute the deed of reconveyance of the land in favor of the plaintiffs heirs of Rufino Dulay, Sr.\n\nSO ORDERED. [14] In revoking the deed of donation, the trial court ruled that the donation was subject to a resolutory condition, namely, that the land donated shall be used for school purposes. It was no longer necessary to determine the intended \"school purpose\" because it was established that the donee did not use the land. Thus, the condition was not complied with since the property was donated in July 1981. Moreover, the DECS did not intend to use the property for school purposes because a school had already been built and established in another lot located in the same barangay, about two kilometers away from the subject land. Finally, the trial court rejected petitioners' contention that the donation was inofficious.\n\nAggrieved, the OSG appealed the decision to the CA.\n\nOn July 30, 2004, the appellate court rendered judgment affirming the decision. The court held that the DECS failed to comply with the condition in the donation, that is, to use the property for school purposes. The CA further ruled that the donation was onerous considering that the donee was burdened with the obligation to utilize the land for school purposes; therefore, the four-year prescriptive period under Article 764 of the New Civil Code did not apply. Moreover, the CA declared that a deed of\ndonation is considered a written contract and is governed by Article 1144 of the New Civil Code, which provides for a 10-year prescriptive period from the time the cause of action accrues. According to the CA, the respondents' cause of action for the revocation of the donation should be reckoned from the expiration of a reasonable opportunity for the DECS to comply with what was incumbent upon it.\n\nPetitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied.\n\nPetitioners seek relief from this Court via petition for review on certiorari, contending that:\n\nI.\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THROUGH THE RIZAL NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, HAD COMPLIED WITH THE CONDITION IMPOSED IN THE DEED OF DONATION.\n\nII.\n\nRESPONDENTS' RIGHT TO SEEK THE REVOCATION OF THE DEED OF DONATION, IF THERE BE ANY, IS ALREADY BARRED BY PRESCRIPTION AND LACHES. [15] The Court shall resolve the issues raised by petitioners seriatim .\n\nThe donee failed to comply with\nthe condition imposed in the deed\nof donation\n\nThe issue of whether or not petitioner DECS was able to comply with the condition imposed in the deed of donation is one of fact. There is a question of fact when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts or when the query necessarily solicits calibration of the whole evidence considering mostly the credibility of witnesses, existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole and probabilities of the situation. [16] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari, for the simple reason that this Court is not a trier of facts. It is not for the Court to calibrate the evidence on record, as this is the function of the trial court. Although there are well-defined exceptions to the rule, nevertheless, after a review of the records, we find no justification to depart therefrom. Moreover, the trial court's findings of facts, as affirmed by the appellate court on appeal, are binding on this Court, unless the trial and appellate courts overlooked, misconstrued or misinterpreted facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would change the outcome of the case. The case has been reviewed thoroughly, and we find no justification to reverse the CA decision.\n\nPetitioners, through the OSG, maintain that the condition (to use the property for school purposes) is not limited to the construction of a school building, but includes utilizing it as a technology and home economics laboratory where students and teachers plant palay, mahogany seedlings, and fruit-bearing trees. The OSG insists that the donee did not specify in the deed that the property should be used for the construction of a school building. According to the OSG, the proceeds of the harvest were used and are still being used by the Rizal National High School for the construction and improvement of its present school site. Moreover, it was verified that there was palay planted on the donated property during the ocular inspection on the property.\n\nIn their comment on the petition, respondents dispute petitioners' contentions, and aver that no evidence was presented to prove that, indeed, palay , mahogany seedlings and fruit-bearing trees were planted on the property. Respondents also emphasized that when the trial court inspected the subject property, it was discovered to be barren and without any improvement although some portions thereof were planted with palay. Petitioners even failed to adduce evidence to identify the person who planted the palay.\n\nThe contention of petitioners has no merit.\n\nAs gleaned from the CA decision, petitioners failed to prove that the donated property was used for school purposes as indicated in the deed of donation:\nWe find it difficult to sustain that the defendant-appellants have complied with the condition of donation. It is not amiss to state that other than the bare allegation of the defendant-appellants, there is nothing in the records that could concretely prove that the condition of donation has been complied with by the defendant-appellants. In the same breadth, the planting of palay on the land donated can hardly be considered and could not have been the \"school purposes\" referred to and intended by the donors when they had donated the land in question. Also, the posture of the defendant-appellants that the land donated is being used as technology and home economics laboratory of the Rizal National High School is far from being the truth considering that not only is the said school located two kilometers away from the land donated but also there was not even a single classroom built on the land donated that would reasonably indicate that, indeed, classes have been conducted therein. These observations, together with the unrebutted ocular inspection report made by the trial court which revealed that the land donated remains idle and without any improvement thereon for more than a decade since the time of the donation, give Us no other alternative but to conclude that the defendant-appellants have, indeed, failed to comply with what is incumbent upon them in the deed of donation. [17] In its Order [18] dated March 6, 2001, the RTC reiterated that during the ocular inspection of the property conducted in the presence of the litigants and their counsel, it observed that \"the land was barren; there were no improvements on the donated property though a portion thereof was planted with palay [and a demolished house built in 1979.]\"\n\nMoreover, petitioners failed to adduce a shred of evidence to prove that the palay found in the property was planted by DECS personnel or at its instance or even by students of the Rizal National High School. No evidence was adduced to prove that there were existing plans to use the property for school purposes. Petitioners even debilitated their cause when they claimed in the trial court that the barangay acquired the property by purchase, relying on the certification of former Barangay Captain Jesus San Juan.\n\nThe right to seek the revocation of\ndonation had not yet prescribed\nwhen respondents filed their complaint\n\nAnent the second issue, we reject the contention of the OSG that respondents' cause of action is already barred by prescription under Article 764 of the New Civil Code, or four years from the non-compliance with the condition in the deed of donation. Since such failure to comply with the condition of utilizing the property for school purposes became manifest sometime in 1988 when the DECS utilized another property for the construction of the school building, the four-year prescriptive period did not commence on such date. Petitioner was given more than enough time to comply with the condition, and it cannot be allowed to use this fact to its advantage. It must be stressed that the donation is onerous because the DECS, as donee, was burdened with the obligation to utilize the land donated for school purposes. Under Article 733 of the New Civil Code, a donation with an onerous cause is essentially a contract and is thus governed by the rules on contract. [19] We fully agree with the ruling of the appellate court:\nxxx With this, [we] decline to apply the four-year prescriptive period for the revocation of donation provided under Article 764 of the New Civil Code and instead apply the general rules on contracts since Article 733 of the same Code, specifically provided that onerous donations shall be governed by the rules on contracts.\n\nCorollarily, since a deed of donation is considered a written contract, it is governed by Article 1144 of the New Civil Code, which provides that the prescriptive period for an action arising from a written contract is ten (10) years from the time the cause of action accrues. In the case of donation, the accrual of the cause of action is from the expiration of the time within which the donee must comply with the conditions or obligations of the donation. In the instant case, however, it must be noted that the subject donation fixed no period within which the donee can comply with the condition of donation. As such, resort to Article 1197 of the New Civil Code is necessary. Said article provides that if the obligation does not fix a period, but from its nature and the circumstances it can be inferred that a period was intended, the courts may fix the duration thereof. Indeed, from the nature and circumstances of the condition of the subject donation, it can be inferred that a period was contemplated by the donors. The donors could not have intended their property to remain idle for a very long period of time when, in fact, they specifically obliged the defendant-appellants to utilize the land donated for school purposes and thus put it in good use. xxx [20] In Central Philippine University v. Court of Appeals, [21] a case squarely in point, we have established that the legal possibility of bringing the action begins with the e xpiration of a reasonable opportunity for the donee to fulfill what has been charged upon it by the donor. Likewise, we held that even if Article 1197 of the New Civil Code provides that the courts may fix the duration when the obligation does not determine the period but from its nature and circumstances it can be inferred that a period was intended, the general rule cannot be applied because to do so would be a mere technicality and would serve no other purpose than to delay or lead to an unnecessary and expensive multiplication of suits. [22]\n\nAltogether, it has been 16 years since the execution of the deed of donation. Petitioner DECS failed to use the property for the purpose specified in the deed of donation. The property remained barren and unutilized. Even after respondents sought the return of the property before the courts, petitioner DECS still failed to draw up plans to use the property for school purposes. In fine, petitioner DECS has no use for the property; hence, the same shall be reverted to the respondents.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED . The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

TRADERS ROYAL BANK,[1] RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, CJ:\n\nThe mere fact that a defendant is declared in default\u00a0 does not automatically result in the grant of the prayers of the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 To win, the latter must still present the same quantum of evidence that would be required if the defendant were still present.\u00a0 A party that defaults is not deprived of its rights, except the right to be heard and to present evidence to the trial court.\u00a0 If the evidence presented does not support a judgment for the plaintiff, the complaint should be dismissed, even if the defendant may not have been heard or allowed to present any countervailing evidence.\n\nThe Case\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review [2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 29, 2001 Decision [3] and December 6, 2001 Resolution [4] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 43889.\u00a0 The CA disposed as follows:\n\"UPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS, the partial judgment appealed from, must be, as it hereby is, VACATED and SET ASIDE, and another one entered DISMISSING the complaint at bench.\u00a0 Without costs.\" [5]\nThe assailed Resolution denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration [6] for lack of merit.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe CA narrated the facts as follows:\n\"[Petitioners] filed a complaint before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 90, against [respondent] Traders Royal Bank, the City Sheriff of Quezon City and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City.\u00a0 Docketed thereat as Civil Case No. Q-41203, the complaint sought the annulment of the extra-judicial foreclosure and auction sale made by [the] city sheriff of Quezon City of a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 16711 of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City, the conventional redemption thereof, and prayed for damages and the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.\n\n\"The complaint alleged that in mid 1977, [Petitioner] Danilo Chua obtained a loan from [respondent] bank in the amount of P75,000.00 secured by a real estate mortgage over a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 16711, and owned in common by the [petitioners]; that when the loan was not paid, [respondent] bank commenced extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings on the property; that the auction sale of the property was set on 10 June 1981, but was reset to 31 August 1981, on [Petitioner Chua's] request, which, however, was made without the knowledge and conformity of the other [petitioners]; that on the re-scheduled auction sale, [the] Sheriff of Quezon City sold the property to the [respondent] bank, the highest bidder therein, for the sum of P24,911.30; that the auction sale was tainted with irregularity because, amongst others, the bid price was shockingly or unconscionably, low; that the other [petitioners] failed to redeem the property due to their lack of knowledge of their right of redemption, and want of sufficient education; that, although the period of redemption had long expired, [Petitioner] Chua offered to buy back, and [respondent] bank also agreed to sell back, the foreclosed property, on the understanding that Chua would pay [respondent] bank the amount of P40,135.53, representing the sum that the bank paid at the auction sale, plus interest; that [Petitioner] Chua made an initial payment thereon in the amount of P4,000.00, covered by Interbank Check No. 09173938, dated 16 February 1984, duly receipted by [respondent] bank; that, in a sudden change of position, [respondent] bank wrote Chua, on 20 February 1984, asking that he could repurchase the property, but based on the current market value thereof; and that sometime later, or on 22 March 1984, [respondent] bank wrote Chua anew, requiring him to tender a new offer to counter the offer made thereon by another buyer.\n\n\"Traversing [petitioners'] complaint, [respondent] bank, upon 05 July 1984, filed its answer with counterclaim, thereunder asserting that the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property was done in accordance with law; and that the bid price was neither unconscionable, nor shockingly low; that [petitioners] slept on their rights when they failed to redeem the property within the one year statutory period; and that [respondent] bank, in offering to sell the property to [Petitioner] Chua on the basis of its current market price, was acting conformably with law, and with legitimate banking practice and regulations.\n\n\"Pre-trial having been concluded, the parties entered upon trial, which dragged/lengthened to several months due to postponements.\u00a0 Upon 11 June 1988, however, a big conflagration hit the City Hall of Quezon City, which destroyed, amongst other things, the records of the case.\u00a0 After the records were reconstituted, [petitioners] discovered that the foreclosed property was sold by [respondent] bank to the Ceroferr Realty Corporation, and that the notice of lis pendens annotated on the certificate of title of the foreclosed property, had already been cancelled.\u00a0 Accordingly, [petitioners], with leave of court, amended their complaint, but the Trial Court dismissed the case 'without prejudice' due to [petitioners'] failure to pay additional filing fees.\n\n\"So, upon 11 June 1990, [petitioners] re-filed the complaint with the same Court, whereat it was docketed as Civil Case No. 90-5749, and assigned to Branch 98: the amended complaint substantially reproduced the allegations of the original complaint.\u00a0 But [petitioners] this time impleaded as additional defendants the Ceroferr Realty Corporation and/or Cesar Roque, and Lorna Roque, and included an additional cause of action, to wit: that said new defendants conspired with [respondent] bank in [canceling] the notice of lis pendens by falsifying a letter sent to and filed with the office of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City, purportedly for the cancellation of said notice.\n\n\"Summons was served on [respondent] bank on 26 September 1990, per Sheriff's Return dated 08 October 1990.\u00a0 Supposing that all the defendants had filed their answer, [petitioners] filed, on 23 October 1991, a motion to set case for pre-trial, which motion was, however, denied by the Trial Court in its Order of 25 October 1991, on the ground that [respondent] bank has not yet filed its answer.\u00a0 On 13 November 1991[, petitioners] filed a motion for reconsideration, thereunder alleging that they received by registered mail, on 19 October 1990, a copy of [respondent] bank's answer with counterclaim, dated 04 October 1990, which copy was attached to the motion.\u00a0 In its Order of 14 November 1991, the trial Court denied for lack of merit, the motion for reconsideration, therein holding that the answer with counterclaim filed by [respondent] bank referred to another civil case pending before Branch 90 of the same Court.\n\n\"For this reason, [petitioners] filed on 02 December 1991 a motion to declare [respondent] bank in default, thereunder alleging that no answer has been filed despite the service of summons on it on 26 September 1990.\n\n\"On 13 December 1991, the Trial Court declared the motion submitted for resolution upon submission by [petitioners] of proof of service of the motion on [respondent] bank.\n\n\"Thus, on 16 January 1992, upon proof that [petitioners] had indeed served [respondent] bank with a copy of said motion, the Trial Court issued an Order of default against [respondent] bank.\n\n\"Upon 01 December 1992, on [petitioners'] motion, they were by the Court allowed to present evidence ex parte on 07 January 1993, insofar as [respondent] bank was concerned.\n\n\"Thereafter, or on 08 February 1993, the Trial Court rendered the new questioned partial decision. [7]\n\n\"Aggrieved, [respondent] bank filed a motion to set aside [the] partial decision by default against Traders Royal Bank and admit [respondent] Traders Royal Bank's x x x Answer with counterclaim: thereunder it averred, amongst others, that the erroneous filing of said answer was due to an honest mistake of the typist and inadvertence of its counsel.\n\n\"The [trial court] thumbed down the motion in its Order of 26 July 1993.\" [8]\nRespondent bank appealed the Partial Decision[9] to the CA.\u00a0 During the pendency of that appeal, Ceroferr Realty Corporation and/or Cesar and/or Lorna Roque filed a Manifestation with Motion [10] asking the CA to discharge them as parties, because the case against them had already been dismissed on the basis of their Compromise Agreement [11] with petitioners.\u00a0 On May 14, 1996, the CA issued a Resolution [12] granting Ceroferr et al.'s Manifestation with Motion to discharge movants as parties to the appeal.\u00a0 The Court, though, deferred resolution of the matters raised in the Comment [13] of respondent bank.\u00a0 The latter contended that the Partial Decision had been novated by the Compromise Agreement, whose effect of res judicata had rendered that Decision functus officio.\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\n\nThe CA ruled in favor of respondent bank.\u00a0 Deemed, however, to have rested on shaky ground was the latter's \"Motion to Set Aside Partial Decision by Default Against Traders Royal Bank and Admit Defendant Traders Royal Bank's Answer.\" [14] The reasons offered by the bank for failing to file an answer were considered by the appellate court to be \"at once specious, shallow and sophistical and can hardly be dignified as a 'mistake' or 'excusable negligence,' which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.\" [15]\n\nIn particular, the CA ruled that the erroneous docket number placed on the Answer filed before the trial court was not an excusable negligence by the bank's counsel.\u00a0 The latter had a bounden duty to be scrupulously careful in reviewing pleadings.\u00a0 Also, there were several opportunities to discover and rectify the mistake, but these were not taken.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the bank's Motion to Set Aside the Partial Decision and to Admit [the] Answer was not accompanied by an affidavit of merit.\u00a0 These mistakes and the inexcusable negligence committed by respondent's lawyer were binding on the bank.\n\nOn the issue of whether petitioners had convincingly established their right to relief, the appellate court held that there was no ground to invalidate the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property. First, under Section 3 of Act No. 3135, an extrajudicial foreclosure sale did not require personal notice to the mortgagor. Second, there was no allegation or proof of noncompliance with the publication requirement and the public posting of the notice of sale, provided under Act No. 3135, as amended. Third, there was no showing of inadequacy of price as no competent evidence was presented to show the real market value of the land sold or the readiness of another buyer to offer a price higher than that at which the property had been sold.\n\nMoreover, petitioners failed to prove that the bank had agreed to sell the property back to them.\u00a0 After pointing out that the redemption period had long expired, respondent's written communications to Petitioner Chua only showed, at most, that the former had made a proposal for the latter to buy back the property at the current market price; and that Petitioner Chua was requested to make an offer to repurchase the property, because another buyer had already made an offer to buy it.\u00a0 On the other hand, respondent noted that the Interbank check for P4,000 was for \"deposit only.\"\u00a0 Thus, there was no showing that the check had been issued to cover part of the repurchase price.\n\nThe appellate court also held that the Compromise Agreement had not resulted in the novation of the Partial Decision, because the two were not incompatible.\u00a0 In fact, the bank was not even a party to the Agreement.\u00a0 Petitioners' recognition of Ceroferr's title to the mortgaged property was intended to preclude future litigation against it.\n\nHence this Petition. [16]\n\nIssues\n\nIn their Memorandum, petitioners raise the following issues:\n\n\"1.\u00a0 Whether or not the Respondent Court of Appeals erred in failing to apply the provisions of Section 3, Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure [and in applying instead] the rule on preponderance of evidence under Section 1, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court.\n\n\"2. Whether or not the respondent appellate court failed to apply the conventional redemption rule provided for under Article 1601 of the New Civil Code.\n\n\"3. Whether or not this Honorable Court can exercise its judicial prerogative to evaluate the findings of facts.\" [17]\nThe first issue is one of law and may be taken up by the Court without hindrance, pursuant to Section 1 of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. [18] The second and the third issues, however, would entail an evaluation of the factual findings of the appellate court, a function ordinarily not assumed by this Court, unless in some excepted cases.\u00a0 The Court will thus rule on the first issue before addressing the second and the third issues jointly.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Petition has no merit.\n\nFirst Issue:\nQuantum of Proof\n\nPetitioners challenge the CA Decision for applying Section 3 of Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, rather than Section 1 of Rule 133 of the same Rules.\u00a0 In essence, petitioners argue that the quantum of evidence for judgments flowing from a default order under Section 3 of Rule 9 is not the same as that provided for in Section 1 of Rule 133.\n\nFor ease of discussion, these two rules will be reproduced below, starting with Section 3 of Rule 9 of the Rules of Court:\n\"Sec. 3. Default; declaration of. \u2014 If the defending party fails to answer within the time allowed therefor, the court shall, upon motion of the claiming party with notice to the defending party, and proof of such failure, declare the defending party in default.\u00a0 Thereupon, the court shall proceed to render judgment granting the claimant such relief as his pleading may warrant, unless the court in its discretion requires the claimant to submit evidence.\u00a0 Such reception of evidence may be delegated to the clerk of court.\n\n\"(a) Effect of order of default. \u2014 A party in default shall be entitled to notice of subsequent proceedings but not to take part in the trial.\n\n\"(b) Relief from order of default. \u2014 A party declared in default may at any time after notice thereof and before judgment file a motion under oath to set aside the order of default upon proper showing that his failure to answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence and that he has a meritorious defense.\u00a0 In such case, the order of default may be set aside on such terms and conditions as the judge may impose in the interest of justice.\n\n\"(c) Effect of partial default. \u2014 When a pleading asserting a claim states a common cause of action against several defending parties, some of whom answer and the others fail to do so, the court shall try the case against all upon the answers thus filed and render judgment upon the evidence presented.\n\n\"(d) Extent of relief to be awarded. \u2014 A judgment rendered against a party in default shall not exceed the amount or be different in kind from that prayed for nor award unliquidated damages.\n\n\"(e) Where no defaults allowed. \u2014 If the defending party in an action for annulment or declaration of nullity of marriage or for legal separation fails to answer, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to investigate whether or nor a collusion between the parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in order to see to it that the evidence submitted is not fabricated.\"\nWe now quote Section 1 of Rule 133:\n\"SECTION 1. Preponderance of evidence, how determined. \u2014 In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence.\u00a0 In determining where the preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the issues involved lies, the court may consider all the facts and circumstances of the case, the witnesses' manner of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may legitimately appear upon the trial.\u00a0 The court may also consider the number of witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greater number.\"\nBetween the two rules, there is no incompatibility that would preclude the application of either one of them.\u00a0 To begin with, Section 3 of Rule 9 governs the procedure which the trial court is directed to take when a defendant fails to file an answer.\u00a0 According to this provision, the court \"shall proceed to render judgment granting the claimant such relief as his pleading may warrant,\" subject to the court's discretion on whether to require the presentation of evidence ex parte.\u00a0 The same provision also sets down guidelines on the nature and extent of the relief that may be granted.\u00a0 In particular, the court's judgment \"shall not exceed the amount or be different in kind from that prayed for nor award unliquidated damages.\"\n\nAs in other civil cases, basic is the rule that the party making allegations has the burden of proving them by a preponderance of evidence. [19] Moreover, parties must rely on the strength of their own evidence, not upon the weakness of the defense offered by their opponent. [20] This principle holds true, especially when the latter has had no opportunity to present evidence because of a default order.\u00a0 Needless to say, the extent of the relief that may be granted can only be as much as has been alleged and proved [21] with preponderant evidence required under Section 1 of Rule 133.\n\nRegarding judgments by default, it was explained in Pascua v. Florendo [22] that complainants are not automatically entitled to the relief prayed for, once the defendants are declared in default.\u00a0 Favorable relief can be granted only after the court has ascertained that the relief is warranted by the evidence offered and the facts proven by the presenting party.\u00a0 In Pascua, this Court ruled that \"x x x it would be meaningless to require presentation of evidence if every time the other party is declared in default, a decision would automatically be rendered in favor of the non-defaulting party and exactly according to the tenor of his prayer. This is not contemplated by the Rules nor is it sanctioned by the due process clause.\" [23]\n\nThe import of a judgment by default was further clarified in Lim Tanhu v. Ramolete. [24] The following disquisition is most instructive:\n\"Unequivocal, in the literal sense, as these provisions [referring to the subject of default then under Rule 18 of the old Rules of Civil Procedure] are, they do not readily convey the full import of what they contemplate.\u00a0 To begin with, contrary to the immediate notion that can be drawn from their language, these provisions are not to be understood as meaning that default or the failure of the defendant to answer should 'be interpreted as an admission by the said defendant that the plaintiff's cause of action find support in the law or that plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for.' x x x.\n\nx x x \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 x x x \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 x x x\n\nBeing declared in default does not constitute a waiver of rights except that of being heard and of presenting evidence in the trial court.\u00a0 x x x.\n\n\"In other words, a defaulted defendant is not actually thrown out of court.\u00a0\u00a0 While in a sense it may be said that by defaulting he leaves himself at the mercy of the court, the rules see to it that any judgment against him must be in accordance with law.\u00a0 The evidence to support the plaintiff's cause is, of course, presented in his absence, but the court is not supposed to admit that which is basically incompetent.\u00a0 Although the defendant would not be in a position to object, elementary justice requires that only legal evidence should be considered against him.\u00a0 If the evidence presented should not be sufficient to justify a judgment for the plaintiff, the complaint must be dismissed.\u00a0 And if an unfavorable judgment should be justifiable, it cannot exceed in amount or be different in kind from what is prayed for in the complaint.\" [25]\nIn sum, while petitioners were allowed to present evidence ex parte under Section 3 of Rule 9, they were not excused from establishing their claims for damages by the required quantum of proof under Section 1 of Rule 133.\u00a0 Stated differently, any advantage they may have gained from the ex parte presentation of evidence does not lower the degree of proof required.\u00a0 Clearly then, there is no incompatibility between the two rules.\n\nSecond and Third\u00a0 Issues:\nReview of the Evidence\n\nPetitioners urge this Court to depart from the general rule that the lower courts' findings of fact are not reviewable in a petition for review. [26] In support of their plea, they cite the conflicting findings of the trial and the appellate courts, as well as the alleged conjectures and surmises made by the CA in arriving at its Decision.\n\nIndeed, the differences between the findings of the two courts a quo , leading to entirely disparate dispositions, is reason enough for this Court to review the evidence in this case. [27] Whether the CA indulged in surmises and conjectures when it issued the assailed Decision will thus be determined.\n\nAt the outset, it behooves this Court to clarify the CA's impression that no evidence was presented in the case which might have contributed to petitioners' challenge to its Decision.\u00a0 The appellate court's observation was based on the notation by the lower court's clerk of court that there were no separate folders for exhibits and transcripts, because\u00a0 \"there was no actual hearing conducted in this case.\" [28]\n\nTrue, there was no hearing conducted between petitioners and respondent , precisely because the latter had been declared in default, and petitioners had therefore been ordered to present their evidence ex parte.\u00a0 But the absence of a hearing did not mean that no evidence was presented.\u00a0 The Partial Decision dated February 8, 1993, in fact clearly enumerated the pieces of evidence adduced by petitioners during the ex parte presentation on January 7, 1993.\u00a0 The documentary evidence they presented consisted of the following:\nA copy of respondent bank's Petition for the extrajudicial foreclosure and auction sale of the mortgaged parcel of land [29]\n\nThe Certificate of Sale that was a consequence of the foreclosure sale [30]\n\nA Statement of Account dated February 15, 1984, showing Petitioner Chua's outstanding debt in the amount of P40,135.53 [31]\n\nA copy of the Interbank check dated February 16, 1984, in the amount of\u00a0 P4,000 [32]\n\nThe Official Receipt issued by the bank acknowledging the check [33]\n\nThe bank's letter dated February 20, 1984, advising Petitioner Chua of the sale of the property at an extrajudicial public auction; the lapse of the period of redemption; and an invitation to purchase the property at its current market price [34]\n\nAnother letter from the bank dated March 22, 1984, inviting Petitioner Chua to submit, within five days, an offer to buy the same property, which another buyer had offered to buy [35]\n\nA copy of the Notice of Lis Pendens, the filing of\u00a0 which was done after that of the Amended Complaint [36]\n\nA copy of the title showing the inscription of the Notice of Lis Pendens [37]\n\nA copy of the Absolute Deed of Sale to Cerrofer [38]\n\nA copy of a letter dated August 29, 1986, made and signed by petitioners' counsel, requesting the cancellation of the Notice of Lis Pendens [39]\n\nA copy of a page of the Memorandum of Encumbrance from TCT No. (314341) 7778/T-39 [40]\nHaving clarified this matter, we proceed to review the facts.\n\nPetitioners do not deny that the one-year period for legal redemption had already lapsed when respondent bank supposedly offered to sell the property in question.\u00a0 The records clearly show that the Certificate of Sale following the extrajudicial public auction of the property was registered on June 21, 1982, the date from which the legal redemption period was to be reckoned. [41] Petitioners insist, though, that they had the right to repurchase the property through conventional redemption, as provided under Article 1601 of the Civil Code, worded as follows:\n\"ART. 1601.\u00a0 Conventional redemption shall take place when the vendor reserves the right to repurchase the thing sold, with the obligation to comply with the provisions of Article 1616 and other stipulations which may have been agreed upon.\"\nIt is true that the one-year period of redemption provided in Act No. 3135, as amended \u2014 the law under which the property here was sold in a foreclosure sale \u2014 is only directory and, as such can be extended by agreement of the parties. [42] However, it has also been held that for legal redemption to be converted into conventional redemption, two requisites must be established: 1) voluntary agreement of the parties to extend the redemption period; and 2) the debtor's commitment to pay the redemption price on a fixed date. [43] Thus, assuming that an offer was made to Petitioner Chua to buy back the property after the lapse of the period of legal redemption, petitioners needed to show that the parties had agreed to extend the period, and that Petitioner Chua had committed to pay the redemption price on a fixed date.\n\nThe letters sent by the bank to Petitioner Chua on February 20 and March 22, 1984, do not convincingly show that the parties arrived at a firm\u00a0 agreement for the repurchase of the property.\u00a0 What can be gleaned from the February 20 letter is that Petitioner Chua proposed to pay the redemption price for the property, but that the bank refused to accede to his request, because the one-year redemption period had already lapsed. [44] The bank, though, had offered to sell back the property to him at the current market value. Indeed, an examination of his earlier letter of February 17, 1984, readily reveals that he expressed willingness to settle his account with the bank, but that his \"present financial situation precludes [him] from effecting an immediate settlement x x x.\" [45]\n\nOn the other hand, the letter dated March 22, 1984, clearly states that \"x x x the Bank rejected [his] request to redeem said property due to [the] lapse of [the] one (1) year legal redemption period.\" [46] Nonetheless, he was \"[invited] to submit an offer to buy the same property in five (5) days from receipt [of the letter].\" [47] Petitioner Chua was also informed that the bank had received an offer to purchase the foreclosed property.\u00a0 As to the P4,000 check enclosed in his proposal dated February 17, 1984, as a token of his good faith, he was advised that the amount was still outstanding in the books of the bank and could be claimed by him if he thought the invitation was not feasible.\n\nMore important, there was no showing that petitioners had committed to pay the redemption price on a fixed date.\u00a0 True, Petitioner Chua had attempted to establish a previous agreement to repurchase the property for less than its fair market value.\u00a0 He had submitted in evidence a Statement of Account [48] dated February 15, 1984, showing a balance of P40,135.53; the Interbank check dated February 16, 1984 , for P4,000, which was deposited to the account of respondent bank; [49] and the Official Receipt for the check. [50]\n\nGranting that these documents evinced an agreement, petitioners were still unable to establish a firm commitment on their part to pay the redemption price on a fixed date.\u00a0 On the contrary, the February 17 letter of Petitioner Chua to the bank clearly manifested that he was not capable of paying the account immediately.\u00a0 For this reason, he proposed to pay in \"three or four installments\" without a specification of dates for the payments, but with a plea for a reduction of the interest charges.\u00a0 That proposal was rejected.\n\nIndeed, other than the Interbank check marked \"for deposit\" by respondent bank, no other evidence was presented to establish that petitioners had offered to pay the alleged redemption price of P40,135.53 on a fixed date.\u00a0 For that matter, petitioners have not shown that they tendered payment of the balance and/or consigned the payment to the court, in order to fulfill their part of the purported agreement.\u00a0 These remedies are available to an aggrieved debtor under Article 1256 of the Civil Code, [51] when the creditor unjustly refuses to accept the payment of an obligation.\n\nThe next question that presents itself for resolution is the propriety of the CA's ruling vacating the Partial Decision of the regional trial court (RTC) and dismissing the case.\u00a0 To recall, the RTC had resolved to withhold a ruling on petitioners' right to redeem conventionally and/or order the reconveyance of the property in question, pending a determination of the validity of the sale to Cerrofer Realty Corporation and Spouses Cesar and Lorna Roque.\u00a0 The trial court, however, granted the prayer for damages against respondent bank.\u00a0 The RTC ruled as follows:\n\"The evidence presented by [petitioners] in so far as the cause of action against [respondent] Traders Royal Bank is concerned are preponderant to support the claims of the [petitioners].\u00a0 However, in view of the fact that the property subject matter of this case has already been conveyed to defendant Cerrofer Realty Corporation thus the issue as to whether or not the said conveyance or sale is valid is sill pending between the [petitioners] and [respondents] Cerrofer Realty Corporation and Cesar Roque and Lorna Roque.\u00a0 Hence, this Court resolves to grant the prayer for damages against Traders Royal Bank.\n\n\"The claims of the [petitioners] as against [respondent] Traders Royal Bank having been established and proved by evidence, judgment is hereby rendered ordering [respondent] Traders Royal Bank to pay [petitioners] actual damage or the market value of the land in question in the sum of P500,000.00; the sum of P70,000.00 as compensatory damages; the sum of P200,000.00 to the heirs of [petitioner] Danilo Chua; and attorney's fees in the sum of P30,000.00.\" [52]\nIn the light of the pending issue as to the validity of the sale of the property to the third parties (Cerrofer Realty Corporation and Spouses Roque), the trial court properly withheld judgment on the matter and thus left the prayer for damages as the sole issue for resolution.\n\nTo adjudge damages, paragraph (d) of Section 3 of Rule 9 of the Rules of Court provides that a judgment against a party in default \"shall not exceed the amount or be different in kind from that prayed for nor award unliquidated damages.\"\u00a0 The proscription against the award of unliquidated damages is significant, because it means that the damages to be awarded must be proved convincingly, in accordance with the quantum of evidence required in civil cases.\n\nUnfortunately for petitioners, the grant of damages was not sufficiently supported by the evidence for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, petitioners were not deprived of their property without cause.\u00a0 As correctly pointed out by the CA, Act No. 3135, as amended, does not require personal notice to the mortgagor. [53] In the present case, there has been no allegation \u2014 much less, proof \u2014 of noncompliance with the requirement of publication and public posting of the notice of sale, as required by Act No. 3135.\u00a0 Neither has there been competent evidence to show that the price paid at the foreclosure sale was inadequate. [54] To be sure, there was no ground to invalidate the sale.\n\nSecond, as previously stated, petitioners have not convincingly established their right to damages on the basis of the purported agreement to repurchase.\u00a0 Without reiterating our prior discussion on this point, we stress that entitlement to actual and compensatory damages must be proved even under Section 3 of Rule 9 of the Rules of Court.\u00a0 The same is true with regard to awards for moral damages and attorney's fees, which were also granted by the trial court.\n\nIn sum, petitioners have failed to convince this Court of the cogency of their position, notwithstanding the advantage they enjoyed in presenting their evidence ex parte.\u00a0 Not in every case of default by the defendant is the complainant entitled to win automatically.\n\nWHEREFORE, this Petition is hereby DENIED and the assailed Decision and Resolution AFFIRMED.

TITO ALVARO AND MARIA VALELO, PETITIONERS, VS. SPS. OSMUNDO TERNIDA AND JULITA RETURBAN, COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nAssailed in this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the July 30, 2004 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 61985 and the November 3, 2004 Resolution [2] which denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe antecedent facts are as follows:\n\nRespondent-spouses Osmundo Ternida and Julita Returban are the owners of the contested property, an 8,450 sq. m. parcel of non-irrigated riceland situated at Barangay Labney, San Jacinto, Pangasinan.\n\nOn May 26, 1986, Julita mortgaged the land to the spouses Salvador de Vera and Juanita Orinion for P28,000.00. As testified [3] to by Julita, she was made to sign a Deed of Pacto de Retro Sale [4] with Salvador who explained to her that what she signed was a mortgage document. As worded, the document provided that Julita has three years from the date of the execution of the document to repurchase the land.\n\nAfter a year, Salvador executed a Deed of Transfer of Mortgage[5] in favor of the spouses Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo for a consideration of P32,000.00. Thereafter, Julita requested from the latter for an additional amount of P3,000.00, at which point, she was asked [6] to sign a Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase. [7]\n\nOn May 22, 1990, Julita again asked for an additional amount of P1,000.00 but she was informed by Jose Calpito that they have transferred the mortgage to the spouses Tito Alvaro and Maria Valelo, herein petitioners. Julita thus went to the petitioners who gave her the additional amount of P1,000.00. Julita claimed that petitioners asked her to sign a document that she believed was a mortgage document but later on turned out to be a Deed of Absolute Sale [8] over the contested property.\n\nWhen Julita tried to redeem the property from the petitioners, the latter refused and claimed that they had purchased the property and were in fact issued Tax Declaration No. 2747. [9]\n\nConsequently, on October 1, 1997, respondents filed a complaint for Annulment of Deed of Sale Documents and Tax Declaration No. 2747 with the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 97-01876-D. [10] After trial on the merits, the trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action. [11] Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration which was however denied. [12]\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, thus:\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is granted and the Decision dated September 10, 1998 of the trial court is reversed and set aside. The Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 22, 1990 between plaintiff-appellant Julita Returban and defendants-appellees spouses Tito Alvaro and Maria Valelo shall be construed as an equitable mortgage and the Tax Declaration 2747 issued in the name of spouses Tito Alvaro and Maria Valelo is annulled. Consequently, plaintiffs-appellants are entitled to redeem the property which shall be effected upon payment of their mortgage debt to defendants-appellees.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13] Hence this petition for review on the following grounds:\nTHAT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT DECLARED THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS EQUITABLE MORTGAGE AND NOT AN ABSOLUTE SALE;\n\nTHAT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT DECLARED THE ANNULMENT OF TAX DECLARATION 2747 IN THE NAMES OF THE PETITIONERS;\n\nTHAT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT FAILED TO APPLY THE JURISPRUDENTIAL RULE LAID DOWN IN ABILLA VS. GOBONSENG, JR., 374 SCRA 51;\n\nTHAT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT FAILED TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF LACHES AND ESTOPPEL;\n\nTHAT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT FAILED TO AWARD DAMAGES IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONERS. [14] Primarily, petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred when it declared the transaction between the parties to be an equitable mortgage instead of an absolute sale.\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nAn equitable mortgage is defined as one which although lacking in some formality, or form or words, or other requisites demanded by a statute, nevertheless reveals the intention of the parties to charge real property as security for a debt, and contains nothing impossible or contrary to law. [15] For the presumption of an equitable mortgage to arise, two requisites must concur: (1) that the parties entered into a contract denominated as a sale; and (2) that their intention was to secure an existing debt by way of a mortgage. [16]\n\nConsequently, the nonpayment of the debt when due gives the mortgagee the right to foreclose the mortgage, sell the property and apply the proceeds of the sale to the satisfaction of the loan obligation. [17]\n\nWe find no merit in petitioners' contention that in the Deed of Absolute Sale executed between them and Julita, the latter totally conveyed her ownership over the disputed property. We have consistently decreed that the nomenclature used by the contracting parties to describe a contract does not determine its nature. The decisive factor is the intention of the parties to the contract \u2013 as shown by their conduct, words, actions and deeds \u2013 prior to, during and after executing the agreement. [18]\n\nWhile there is no single conclusive test to determine whether a deed absolute on its face is really a simple loan accommodation secured by a mortgage,[19] however, the Civil Code enumerates several instances when a contract is clothed with the presumption that it is an equitable mortgage, to wit:\nArticle 1602. The contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage, in any of the following cases:\n\n(1) When the price of a sale with right to repurchase is unusually inadequate;\n\n(2) When the vendor remains in possession as lessee or otherwise;\n\n(3) When upon or after the expiration of the right to repurchase another instrument extending the period of redemption or granting a new period is executed;\n\n(4) When the purchaser retains for himself a part of the purchase price;\n\n(5) When the vendor binds himself to pay the taxes on the thing sold;\n\n(6) In any other case where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation.\n\nIn any of the foregoing cases, any money, fruits, or other benefit to be received by the vendee as rent or otherwise shall be considered as interest which shall be subject to the usury laws. (Emphasis added) It is an established rule that the presence of even one of the circumstances set forth in Article 1602 is sufficient to declare a contract of sale with right to repurchase an equitable mortgage. [20] Thus, under the wise, just and equitable presumption in Article 1602, a document which appears on its face to be a sale \u2013 absolute or with pacto de retro \u2013 may be proven by the vendor or vendor-a- retro to be one of a loan with mortgage. In such case, parol evidence becomes competent and admissible to prove that the instrument was in truth and in fact given merely as a security for the payment of a loan. And upon proof of the truth of such allegations, the court will enforce the agreement or understanding in consonance with the true intent of the parties at the time of the execution of the contract. [21]\n\nApplying the foregoing considerations to the instant case, we find that the true intention of the parties in the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale was never to convey the ownership of the disputed property but merely to secure the loan obtained by Julita. As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals: [22]\nThe circumstances surrounding the execution and performance of the terms of the contracts which plaintiff-appellant Julita Returban was made to sign involving the subject property, are inconsistent with the theory that the property was sold.\n\nWhen plaintiff-appellant Julita Returban first mortgaged the land in favor of spouses Salvador de Vera and Juanita Orinion for the amount of P28,000.00, she was made to sign a Deed of Pacto de Retro Sale. Salvador de Vera himself was aware that the subject property was merely mortgaged, not sold, because he himself subsequently executed a Deed of Transfer Mortgage in favor of spouses Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo ....\n\n....\n\nWhen plaintiff-appellant went to spouses Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo to request an additional P3,000.00, she was made to sign a Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase in favor of Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo for a purported consideration of P35,000.00. But it was admitted by defendant-appellee Maria Valelo during her direct examination that:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nATTY. DE JESUS:\n | \nQ. | You said that the amount of P35,000.00 was given to Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo as redemption price of the land mortgaged by Julita Returban?\n | \nA: | Yes, sir. (Underlining supplied.)\n[END_TABLE]\n\nATTY. DE JESUS:\n\nQ. You said that the amount of P35,000.00 was given to Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo as redemption price of the land mortgaged by Julita Returban?\n\nA: Yes, sir. (Underlining supplied.) Actually, plaintiff-appellant Julita Returban was given P28,000.00 at first and subsequently, she was given the additional amounts of P3,000.00 by Jose Calpito and Zoraida Valelo and P1,000.00 by Tito Alvaro and Maria Valelo. The Supreme Court, in an analogous case, said that:\n\nIf the transactions were a true pacto de retro, the purchase price had been fixed (at P3,600.00) not a centavo more and respondents' giving of additional amounts on (three) different occasions to be aggregated to the redemption price \"was absolutely inconsistent\" with the concept of a \"true sale with pacto de retro.\" For her part, Julita testified that during all the times that she was asked to sign a document evidencing the release of additional sums of money to her, she always believed, as she was made to believe, that she was signing a mortgage document. [23]\n\nVerily, the conduct of Julita before, during and after the mortgage of the disputed property negates petitioners' allegation that she intended to sell the land in their favor. Otherwise, she would have not exerted earnest efforts to redeem the same.\n\nThe conditions which give rise to a presumption of equitable mortgage, as set out in Article 1602 of the Civil Code, apply with equal force to a contract purporting to be one of absolute sale. Moreover, the presence of even one of the circumstances in Article 1602 is sufficient basis to declare a contract as one of equitable mortgage. This is in consonance with the rule that the law favors the least transmission of rights.[24]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED .

MARISSA ANGELES, CLERK OF COURT, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, PANTABANGAN, NUEVA ECIJA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore us is the Complaint [1] dated March 31, 2003 of Beatriz F. Vilar (complainant) charging Marissa Angeles (respondent), Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija, with Dishonesty, Misappropriation and Acts Unbecoming of a Clerk of Court, relative to Civil Case No. 1411 entitled \" Beatriz F. Vilar v. Yolly Uera. \"\n\nComplainant alleges that respondent received from one Yolanda Uera (Uera) the sums of Thirty Two Thousand (P32,000.00) Pesos and Eighty Eight Thousand (P88,000.00) Pesos by way of deposit as evidenced by Official Receipt Nos. 12575750 and 12575749, respectively. The money was intended as payment for the construction materials taken by Uera from the hardware store of the complainant; that despite demand, respondent failed and refused to release the money and there is a strong probability that the said money was misappropriated and converted to the personal use of respondent.\n\nIn her Counter Affidavit dated April 19, 2004, [2] respondent avers that it was not complainant, but her lawyer, who demanded and approached her to give the amount of P120,000.00; that she gave P10,000.00 to complainant's lawyer when the latter demanded the amount of P120,000.00 because that was the only money she has; and that what were stated in the complaint were all lies and the accusations were not true.\n\nIn its Resolution of August 25, 2004, [3] the Court referred the administrative complaint to Executive Judge Bayani V. Vargas, Branch 38, Regional Trial Court (RTC), San Jose City, Nueva Ecija for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nIn a letter dated December 8, 2004, [4] Judge Vargas initially reported that during the informal hearing, complainant granted the plea of respondent not to pursue the complaint provided that respondent settle her financial obligation.\n\nDuring the scheduled hearing on January 21, 2005, [5] complainant manifested that she will pursue her administrative case against respondent considering that only Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos had been partially paid by respondent.\n\nIn view of the appointment of investigating Executive Judge Vargas to the RTC, Br. 219, Quezon City, the Court, in its Resolution of June 22, 2005, [6] designated Acting Executive Judge Joselito Cruz Villarosa to conduct an investigation, report and recommendation on the subject administrative case.\n\nIn her Affidavit with Motion for Reconsideration dated October 25, 2005, [7] respondent admits having received the deposited amounts of P32,000.00 and P88,000.00 on April 26, 2002 and June 10, 2002, respectively. Respondent states that she has no intention to use the money as her own because the same is intended as payment to complainant; that the total amount of P51,000.00 has already been returned to complainant on installment basis; that complainant assured her that she (complainant) is willing to withdraw the complaint on agreement that she (respondent) will pay back the remaining balance on installment basis; that she failed to pay complainant due to the fact that her son was hospitalized on August 8-12, 2005 due to heart ailment and she spent P37,000.00 for it; that in her 22 years of service, she has never been charged either criminally or administratively and has no intention of besmirching her reputation, as it is the only legacy she can leave with her children. Respondent prays that the Court give her time to fully pay her balance to plaintiff considering the fact that complainant is willing to withdraw the complaint as soon as the remaining balance is fully paid. She further avers that her husband is jobless and she is the breadwinner of the family with two children about to finish their course; that her older son is still recovering from heart ailment and needs continuous medication; that her family lives on a hand-to-mouth existence and is dependent on her salary as a clerk of court.\n\nIn his Investigation, Report and Recommendation dated November 16, 2005, [8] the Investigating Judge found respondent guilty of dishonesty and acts unbecoming of a clerk of court and recommended the penalty of six (6) months suspension without pay and ordered her to pay complainant the amount of Seventy Five Thousand (P75,000.00) Pesos within fifteen (15) days upon receipt of the decision.\n\nIn its Resolution of June 14, 2006, [9] the Court referred the report of the Investigating Judge to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for evaluation, report and recommendation.\n\nIn its Memorandum of October 20, 2006, [10] the OCA submitted its evaluation and recommendation, to wit:\nx x x\n\nAfter careful evaluation of the records of the case, the undersigned concurs with the findings of the Investigating Judge as the same is in conformity with the law and jurisprudence. The undersigned, however, differs from the penalty as recommended by the investigating judge which we believe to be too light.\n\nThe respondent admitted having received money in the mentioned amounts with the instruction of forwarding the same to the complainant. The respondent failed to deliver the money as she was instructed to do.\n\nWorst she used the same for the hospitalization of her son. What complicates the predicament of respondent is her issuance of official receipts of the court for the deposited amounts thus, making the deposit fiduciary funds or public funds which the Court is obligated to return. It should be noted that a fiduciary fund is in the nature of a trust fund which should not be withdrawn without the authority of the court (RE: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao del Norte, A.M. No. 95-4-143-RTC, 13 March 1998, 287 SCRA 510). Its use for private purposes constitutes misappropriation of public funds.\n\nThe conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, the courts below not excepted, from the presiding judge to the lowest clerk, must be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. A public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity for no less than the Constitution mandates that a public office is a public trust and public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives ( Civil Service Commission v. Cortez , GR No. 155732, 03 June 2004).\n\nParticularly referring to Clerks of Court, and as the custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises, they perform very delicate functions and are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment thereof ( Toribio v. Ofilas , A.M. No. P-03-1714, 13 February 2004).\n\nFor those who have fallen short of their accountabilities, we have not hesitated to impose the ultimate penalty. This Court had never and will never tolerate nor condone any conduct which would violate the norms of public accountability, and diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the justice system ( Office of the Court Administrator v. Galo , A.M. No. P-93-989, 21 September 1999, 314 SCRA 705, pp. 711-712).\n\nThe Court, in Racho v. Dulatre (A.M. No. P-01-1468, 10 February 2005, 450 SCRA 568, 576), held that the failure of a clerk of court to account for money deposited with him, and adequately explain and present evidence thereon, constitutes gross dishonesty.\n\nSection 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Resolution No. 991936, effective September 27, 1999), provides:\nClassification of Offenses. -Administrative offenses with corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave or light, depending on their gravity or depravity and effects on the government service.\n\nA. The following are grave offenses with their corresponding penalties:\n\n1. Dishonesty\n1 st Offense - Dismissal\n20. Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service\n1 st Offense - Suspension (6 mos. 1 day to 1 year)\n2 nd Offense - Dismissal x x x\n\nRespondent's financial difficulty occasioned by the hospitalization of her son does not justify her use of the funds entrusted her.\n\nSection 53 of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service however, provides that in the determination of the penalties to be imposed, the extenuating, mitigating, aggravating or alternative circumstances may be considered. Verification from the Documentation Division, Office of the Court Administrator shows that this is the first time that respondent has ever been charged administratively. Thus, instead of imposing the penalty of dismissal which is the imposable penalty for commission of the first offense of dishonesty and for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service which is penalized for six (6) months and one (1) day suspension, respondent, should instead be suspended for a period of one (1) year without pay with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future will be dealt with more severely. She should however still be required to pay complainant Beatriz F. Vilar the amount of Seventy Five Thousand (Php75,000.00) Pesos fifteen (15) days upon receipt of the decision of the Court.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the undersigned respectfully recommend to the Honorable Court that Marissa Angeles, Clerk of Court, MTC, Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija be found guilty of Dishonesty and Acts Unbecoming of a Clerk of Court and recommends the penalty of one (1) year suspension without pay and ordered to pay complainant Beatriz F. Vilar the amount of Seventy Five Thousand (Php75,000.00) Pesos fifteen (15) days upon receipt of the decision of the Court. Except for the finding that respondent used the money for the hospitalization of her son, we agree with the findings of the OCA and adopt its recommendations.\n\nA Clerk of Court is an essential and a ranking officer of our judicial system who performs delicate administrative functions vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice. [11]\n\nTime and again, we have reminded court personnel tasked with collections of court funds, such as clerks of courts and cash clerks, to deposit immediately with authorized government depositories the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody. [12] Failure of a public officer to remit funds upon demand by an authorized officer constitutes prima facie evidence that the public officer has put such missing funds or property to personal use. [13]\n\nIn her counter affidavit, respondent did not explain what she did with the money entrusted to her to be forwarded to the complainant. Records show that respondent's son was hospitalized only on August 8-12, 2005 while the money was received by her on April 26 and June 10, 2002 yet, or a little over three years after her receipt of the said amounts. [14] Thus, the findings that respondent used the money for the hospitalization of her son is incorrect.\n\nAs observed by the Investigating Judge, there was an effort on the part of respondent to settle amicably with the complainant by paying the whole amount, having already paid P51,000.00. However, respondent was prevented from fully satisfying her accountabilities due to the hospitalization of her son on August 8-12, 2005, which entailed expenses of P37,000.00 and the latter's continuous medical needs. Such act on the part of respondent will not, however, exculpate her from liability although it will serve to mitigate her culpability.\n\nIt is of no moment that complainant assured respondent that the administrative case will be withdrawn upon full settlement of the latter's accountability. The Investigating Judge was correct in saying that the acts of dishonesty were already consummated. The damage has already been done to the prejudice of the complainant. Moreover, the withdrawal of the complaint or the desistance of a complainant does not warrant the dismissal of an administrative complaint. [15] This Court has an interest in the conduct and behavior of all officials and employees of the judiciary and in ensuring at all times the proper delivery of justice to the people. [16] No affidavit of desistance can divest this Court of its jurisdiction under Section 6, Article VII of the Constitution to investigate and decide complaints against erring employees of the judiciary. [17] The issue in an administrative case is not whether the complaint has a cause of action against the respondent, but whether the employees have breached the norms and standards of the courts. [18]\n\nA public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism, justice, and lead modest lives. [19]\n\nClearly, respondent failed to measure up to the above standards fixed by the Constitution. Her acts constitute dishonesty, not only against the public, but against the Court as well. Surely, such conduct is very unbecoming of a court personnel.\n\nIn Basco v. Gregorio, [20] the Court held that the exacting standards of ethics and morality imposed upon court employees and judges are reflective of the premium placed on the image of the court of justice, and that image is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat. It thus becomes the imperative and sacred duty of everyone charged with the dispensation of justice, from the judge to the lowliest clerk, to maintain the courts' good name and standing as true temples of justice. [21] Circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility, their conduct at all times must not only be characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above suspicion. [22] Indeed every employee of the Judiciary should be an example of integrity, probity, uprightness, honesty and diligence. [23]\n\nWhile we commiserate with the plight of the respondent, being the sole breadwinner of her family and the need for continuous medication of her son for the latter's heart ailment, we cannot condone her wrongdoing. Respondent kept the money deposited to her instead of forwarding the same to the complainant. Worse, she did not deposit the same to the depository bank as mandated under OCA Circular No. 50-95. [24] Clearly, respondent transgressed the bounden duty of the court to the speedy and orderly dispensation of justice and thus, liable for dishonesty. Dishonesty is a \"disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray.\" [25] Dishonesty is a serious offense which reflects on the person's character and exposes the moral decay which virtually destroys his honor, virtue, and integrity. [26]\n\nAs observed by the OCA, the fact that respondent issued official receipts of the court for the deposited amounts made the deposit fiduciary funds or public funds which the Court is obligated to return. [27] And fiduciary funds being in the nature of a trust fund, those should not be withdrawn without the authority of the court. Surely, respondent's conduct is unbecoming of a clerk of court which warrants disciplinary action.\n\nThe Court cannot countenance any conduct, act or omission, committed by those involved in administering justice, which violates the norm of public accountability and which diminishes the faith of the people in the judiciary. [28]\n\nSection 52, Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service classifies dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service as grave offenses with corresponding penalty of dismissal and suspension of six months and one day to one year, respectively, for the first offense.\n\nWhile the Court is duty-bound to sternly wield a corrective hand to discipline its errant employees and to weed out those who are undesirable, it also has the discretion to temper the harshness of its judgment with mercy. [29]\n\nThat respondent clerk of court is a first time offender and has been with the judiciary for twenty two years, mitigate her liability and a penalty of suspension of one year without pay with stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely, is just and reasonable.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent MARISSA ANGELES guilty of dishonesty and conduct unbecoming of a clerk of court. She is SUSPENDED for ONE YEAR WITHOUT PAY with STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nMoreover, respondent is ordered to pay complainant Beatriz F. Vilar the amount of Seventy Five Thousand (P75,000.00) Pesos, within fifteen (15) days upon receipt of this Resolution.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 1-3.\n\n[2] Id. at 16.\n\n[3] Id. at 22.\n\n[4] Id. at 29.\n\n[5] Id. at 36.\n\n[6] Id. at 45.\n\n[7] Id. at 100-101.\n\n[8] Id. at 107-113.\n\n[9] Id. at 122.\n\n[10] Id. at 123-130.\n\n[11] Reyes-Domingo v.

VILLANO, Assistant Vice President of the Eastern Assurance & Surety Corporation in her letter dated September 11 and 14, 1998 regarding the surety bonds Nos. G(16)54276 B-2772 in the amount of P118,779.69 and G(16)54194/B-2691 in the amount of P50,000.00, respectively.[11]Anita asserted that since petitioner failed to comply with the requirements for perfecting an appeal, no appeal was perfected from the decision of the Labor Arbiter and petitioner's appeal should have been \"outrightly dismissed.\"[12]The NLRC denied Anita's motion for reconsideration in its assailed 3 February 1999 Resolution.[13]On 17 August 1999, Anita filed a petition for certiorari[14] before the Court of Appeals assailing the decision and resolution of the NLRC. On 23 August 1999, the Court of Appeals issued the following resolution:Before We act on the instant petition for certiorari, the petitioner is directed to inform this Court in writing, within five (5) days from receipt hereof, the date when C. S. Cruz and Associates, her counsel, received a copy of the Resolution dated February 3, 1999 in the case before the National Labor Relations Commission.SO ORDERED.[15]On 17 April 2000, Anita's new counsel, Emerson C. Tumanon (\"Atty. Tumanon\"), filed with the Court of Appeals his Entry of Appearance and Compliance.[16] Atty. Tumanon asserted that Anita engaged his services as counsel in the present case in view of the death of Anita's former counsel, Ciriaco S. Cruz (\"Atty. Cruz\"), on 26 June 1999. Atty. Tumanon stated that upon verification with the records of the NLRC, he found out that Atty. Cruz never received a copy of the assailed 3 February 1999 Resolution.The Ruling of the Court of AppealsOn 15 March 2002, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment as follows:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the NLRC dated June 11, 1998, as well as its Resolution of February 3, 1999 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In lieu thereof, the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated December 26, 1996 is hereby REINSTATED.SO ORDERED.[17]The Court of Appeals ruled that, contrary to the view of the NLRC, the fact that Anita \"had a second thought about her position as a caretaker or domestic helper as it was not the position she applied for, was not pregnant of bold manifestation that in fact she had difficulty in adjusting herself to the nature of her accepted position.\" The Court of Appeals stated that neither would Anita's \"second thoughts\" bolster petitioner's allegation that Anita \"misrepresented to her foreign employer that she knows the house chores.\"The Court of Appeals held that petitioner's allegation that Anita did not know her job was incredible. The Court of Appeals stated that the nature of the work given to Anita \"such as car-washing the vehicle of her master, cooking the meals, housecleaning and babysitting, was too simple and menial for an ordinary person of average intelligence to easily learn, especially so for Anita, who is a registered midwife and a family woman.\" The Court of Appeals ruled that even granting that Anita did not know her job, petitioner, who had the duty to evaluate her qualification, should have rejected her application outright.The Court of Appeals also ruled that if there is doubt on the credibility of the evidence presented by the parties, the doubt should be resolved in Anita's favor. The Court of Appeals stated that it is a settled rule that in case of doubt, the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the employee.On petitioner's claim that the petition for certiorari was filed out of time, the Court of Appeals ruled that the provisions of law pertinent to the issue were Sections 9 and 10, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.The Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed to prove that Anita's counsel received the first notice of service of the 3 February 1999 resolution of the NLRC. The Court of Appeals stated that except for petitioner's allegation that Anita's counsel received the first, second, and third notices, and the presentation of the certified true copy of the second notice, there is no sufficient proof that Anita's counsel received the first notice.The Court of Appeals also stated that petitioner should have presented the postmaster's certification on the sending of the first notice, which should include the data not only on whether the corresponding notice was issued or sent but also on how, when and to whom delivery of the notice was made. The Court of Appeals held that with petitioner's failure to adduce the required conclusive proof that the postmaster sent the first notice to Anita's counsel, the conclusion was ineluctable that Anita's counsel did not receive the first notice. The Court of Appeals held that there was no way in this case to determine the reckoning date of the period for the filing of the petition for certiorari.Hence, petitioner filed the present petition.The IssuesIn assailing the decision of the Court of Appeals, petitioner contends that: The Petition for Certiorari filed by respondent before the Court of Appeals docketed as CA-G.R. No. Sp-54386 was out of time, hence, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the same; and The factual findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. Adj. (L) 95-01-0306.[18]The Ruling of the CourtWe find merit in the petition.Petitioner has raised a factual issue, i.e., whether Anita was illegally dismissed, which is not proper in a petition for review. We have consistently ruled that it is not the function of this Court to assess and evaluate the facts and the evidence again, our jurisdiction being generally limited to reviewing errors of law that might have been committed by the trial court or administrative agency.[19] Nevertheless, since the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the Labor Arbiter are at variance with those of the NLRC, we resolve to review the records and the evidence presented by the parties.[20]This Court generally accords respect to the factual findings of the NLRC. However, the rule is equally settled that this Court will not uphold erroneous conclusions of the NLRC if the NLRC's findings of fact on which its conclusions are based are not supported by substantial evidence.[21] Substantial evidence, which is the quantum of evidence required to establish a fact in cases before administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, is that level of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[22] Factual findings of administrative agencies will be set aside if found arbitrary.[23]Petitioner assails the appellate court's finding that it was incredible for Anita not to know her job because the nature of work of a domestic helper was easy. Petitioner asserts that the Court of Appeals \"completely overlooked that it was not a matter of learning the job, but it was more on the psychological preparedness of Anita to do menial job, which way back home were being done by her own househelpers.\" Petitioner asserts that it did not say that Anita did not know her job as even petitioner's evaluation of Anita's qualifications was outstanding. Petitioner stresses that Anita's repatriation was of her own accord.On the other hand, Anita asserts that all that petitioner has presented were mere self-serving allegations, such as (1) she was not doing her job as domestic helper; (2) she did not know how to wash clothes; (3) she had broken several glasswares of her foreign employer; and (4) when her foreign employer called her attention, she allegedly answered that she used to have her own househelper at home to do the housekeeping chores for her. Anita asserts that petitioner has not adduced any substantial evidence to support its allegations.Anita also asserts that she did not have second thoughts about accepting the job of domestic helper because she knew how to do the job of a domestic helper.We note that in its Position Paper filed before the Labor Arbiter, petitioner pointed out that they had agreed in their employment contract that Anita's placement was subject to a 40-day probationary period.[24] Anita is deemed to have admitted the existence of this stipulation in the employment contract as she never disputed petitioner's assertion in all the pleadings that she submitted to the NLRC, the Court of Appeals, and this Court. Hence, even if it were true that Anita's foreign employer terminated her services after 10 days of her employment, there could be no illegal dismissal as the termination was effected during the agreed probationary period.The law in point is Section 6, Rule 1, Book VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, thus \u2014Probationary employment. There is probationary employment where the employee, upon his engagement, is made to undergo a trial period during which the employer determines his fitness to qualify for regular employment, based on reasonable standards made known to him at the time of engagement.Probationary employment shall be governed by the following rules:x x x x(c) The services of any employee who has been engaged on probationary basis may be terminated only for a just or authorized cause, when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards prescribed by the employer.(d) In all cases of probationary employment, the employer shall make known to the employee the standards under which he will qualify as a regular employee at the time of his engagement. Where no standards are made known to the employee at that time, he shall be deemed a regular employee.Indeed, an employer, in the exercise of its management prerogative, may hire an employee on a probationary basis in order to determine his fitness to perform his work. The employee's services may be terminated for a just cause or for his failure to qualify as a regular employee based on reasonable standards made known to him at the time of his engagement.[25]Anita was employed as a domestic helper on a probationary basis. Her foreign employer interviewed her through telephone calls and apprised her of the terms and conditions of her employment as househelper. Upon her arrival at her employer's house in Taiwan, her employer apprised her again of her duties as househelper.[26]The findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter which the NLRC and the Court Appeals adopted reveal that Anita's foreign employer was dissatisfied with her performance.The law in protecting the rights of the laborer authorizes neither oppression nor self-destruction of the employer. While the Constitution is committed to the policy of social justice and the protection of the working class, it should not be supposed that every labor dispute would automatically be decided in favor of labor.[27]However, although Anita's employment was terminated because she failed to meet the standards of her foreign employer, still it is necessary and obligatory to afford Anita her basic right to notice. Section 2, Rule 1, Book VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code provides:Security of tenure. (a) In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for just or authorized causes as provided by law, and subject to the requirements of due process.(b) The foregoing shall also apply in cases of probationary employment; provided, however, that in such cases, termination of employment due to failure of the employee to qualify in accordance with the standards of the employer made known to the former at the time of engagement may also be a ground for termination of employment.x x x x(d) In all cases of termination of employment, the following standards of due process shall be substantially observed:x x x xIf the termination is brought about by the completion of a contract or phase thereof, or by failure of an employee to meet the standards of the employer in the case of probationary employment, it shall be sufficient that a written notice is served the employee within a reasonable time from the effective date of termination. (Emphasis supplied)Records disclose that Anita was repatriated to the Philippines on 25 January 1995. On the night before her departure, her employer's wife merely told her that she was sending her home \"on account of some problem.\" When Anita asked Ms. Go, who accompanied her to the airport the following day, why she was being repatriated, Ms. Go merely answered that \"there was some kind of a problem.\"[28]The information given to Anita cannot be considered as equivalent to the written notice required by law to be served on the employee. The notice should inform the employee of the ground or grounds for his termination and that his dismissal is being sought.The absence of notice in the present case makes Anita's termination defective for which petitioner must be sanctioned for its non-compliance with the requirements of or for failure to observe due process. Not being a mere technicality but part of procedural due process, to which every employee is entitled to ensure that the employer's prerogative to dismiss is not exercised arbitrarily, this requisite notice must be complied with strictly.[29]Hence, it was incumbent upon Anita's foreign employer to comply with this requirement. This, her employer failed to do, entitling Anita to nominal damages[30] of P30,000 in accordance with recent jurisprudence,[31] to vindicate or recognize her right to procedural due process which was violated by her employer.In Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission,[32] this Court held:Where the dismissal is for a just cause, as in the instant case, the lack of statutory due process should not nullify the dismissal, or render it illegal, or ineffectual. However, the employer should indemnify the employee for the violation of his statutory rights, as ruled in Reta v. National Labor Relations Commission. The indemnity to be imposed should be stiffer to discourage the abhorrent practice of \"dismiss now, pay later,\" which we sought to deter in the Serrano ruling. The sanction should be in the nature of indemnification or penalty and should depend on the facts of each case, taking into special consideration the gravity of the due process violation of the employer.Under the Civil Code, nominal damages is adjudicated in order that a right of the plaintiff, which has been violated or invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him.As enunciated by this Court in Viernes v. National Labor Relations Commission, an employer is liable to pay indemnity in the form of nominal damages to an employee who has been dismissed if, in effecting such dismissal, the employer fails to comply with the requirements of due process. The Court, after considering the circumstances therein, fixed the indemnity at P2,590.50, which was equivalent to the employee's one month salary. This indemnity is intended not to penalize the employer but to vindicate or recognize the employee's right to statutory due process which was violated by the employer.The violation of the petitioners' right to statutory due process by the private respondent warrants the payment of indemnity in the form of nominal damages. The amount of such damages is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, taking into account the relevant circumstances. Considering the prevailing circumstances in the case at bar, we deem it proper to fix it at P30,000.00. We believe this form of damages would serve to deter employers from future violations of the statutory due process rights of employees. At the very least, it provides a vindication or recognition of this fundamental right granted to the latter under the Labor Code and its Implementing Rules.While it is no longer necessary to resolve the other issues presented in this petition, still we opt to discuss them one by one.Petitioner asserts that Anita filed her petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals out of time. According to petitioner, on the envelope containing the assailed 3 February 1999 Resolution are annotations consisting of: (a) Atty. Ciriaco S. Cruz, C. S. Cruz & Associates, Counsel for Complainant, 1801 Int. J. P. Laurel St., San Miguel, Manila; (b) First Notice; (c) Second Notice; (d) Third Notice; and (e) Return to Sender Unclaimed. Petitioner asserts that these annotations reveal how, when, and to whom delivery of the mail was made.Petitioner contends that since only the date of the second notice of the postmaster \u2014 23 February 1999 \u2014 is readable, it can be deduced from this that Atty. Cruz constructively received the 3 February 1999 Resolution on 28 February 1999 or five days from 23 February 1999.Petitioner also argues that it is not necessary to present the postmaster's certification. Petitioner maintains that the annotations on the mail envelope \"can stand on equal footing with and have similar evidentiary value as a postmaster's certification.\"Petitioner stresses that since Anita's counsel filed the petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals only on 17 August 1999 or more than 60 days from 28 February 1999, the Resolution \"has already assumed finality and the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction over that petition.\"These arguments are erroneous. Section 9, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:Service of judgments, final orders or resolutions. \u2014 Judgments, final orders or resolutions shall be served either personally or by registered mail. x x xSection 10 of the same Rule provides:Completeness of service. \u2014 Personal service is complete upon actual delivery. Service by ordinary mail is complete upon the expiration of ten (10) days after mailing, unless the court otherwise provides. Service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt by the addressee, or after five (5) days from the date he received the first notice of the postmaster, whichever date is earlier.The rule on service by registered mail contemplates two situations: (1) actual service the completeness of which is determined upon receipt by the addressee of the registered mail and (2) constructive service the completeness of which is determined upon expiration of five days from the date the addressee received the first notice of the postmaster.In the present case, there is no proof of actual receipt of the notice of the registered mail by Anita's counsel. Petitioner merely relied on the envelope which bore the notations \"Return to Sender Unclaimed,\" \"Second Notice 2-23,\" and \"Third Notice\"[33] tending to indicate that the registered mail was returned to sender because it was unclaimed despite the notices sent by the postmaster to the addressee. Petitioner should not have relied on these notations to support the presumption of constructive service.[34] The envelope does not constitute sufficient proof that a first notice was sent by the postmaster, much less, that there was completeness of service.[35]A party who relies on constructive service or who contends that his adversary has received a copy of a final order or judgment upon the expiration of five days from the date the addressee received the first notice sent by the postmaster must prove that the first notice was actually received by the addressee.[36]For completeness of constructive service, there must be conclusive proof that Anita's former counsel had actually received the notice.[37] Such proof requires a certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee. Thus, Section 13 of Rule 13 provides:Proof of service. \u2014 x x x If service is made by registered mail, proof shall be made by such affidavit and the registry receipt issued by the mailing office. The registry return card shall be filed immediately upon its receipt by the sender, or in lieu thereof of the unclaimed letter together with the certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee. (Emphasis supplied)There must be compliance with Section 13 of Rule 13 on proof of service by registered mail. As the Court ruled in Dela Cruz v. Dela Cruz:[38]In the present case there is no proof of the actual receipt of the notice of the registered mail by counsel for the defendants, Atty. Belen. The trial court merely relied on the notations on the wrapper or envelope of the returned order of September 21, 1965 consisting of \"R & S\", \"unclaimed\" and the stamped box with the wordings \"2nd notice\" and \"last notice\" tending to indicate that the registered mail was returned to sender because it was unclaimed inspite of the notices sent by the postmaster to the addressee therein. The trial court, on the basis of said notations, assumed that the first notice of the postmaster must have been received by defendants on or before November 3, 1965, the date when the order in the envelope was returned to the Urdaneta Post Office. This finding of the court a quo is untenable.In Barrameda vs. Castillo, this Court held:Therefore, to obviate injustice, it is incumbent upon a party, who relies on constructive service or who contends that his adversary was served with a copy of a final order or judgment upon the expiration of five days from the first notice of registered mail sent by the postmaster to prove that the first notice was sent and delivered to the addressee. A certification from the postmaster would be the best evidence of that fact (Grafil vs. Feliciano, L-27156, June 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 616). The mailman's testimony may also be adduced to prove that fact, as was done in Aldecoa vs. Hon. Arellano and Siguenza, 113 Phil. 75, 78.The postmaster's certification as to the sending of the first notice \"should include the data not only as to whether or not the corresponding notices were issued or sent but also as to how, when and to whom the delivery thereof was made.\" (Hernandez vs. Navarro, L-28296, November 24, 1972, 48 SCRA 44, 64, per Barredo, J.).As stressed by Justice Barredo in a recent case, \"there must be clear proof of compliance with the postal regulations governing the sending and receipt of the notice referred to in\" section 8 of Rule 13 (Vecino vs. Court of Appeals, L-38612, March 29, 1977). The mere exhibition in court of the envelope containing the unclaimed mail is not sufficient proof that a first notice was sent.Note that in a certain case a first notice was sent but it was received by the addressee's eleven-year old child who did not deliver it to the addressee himself. It was held that to apply the presumption in that case and to insist on constructive service would work an injustice rather than promote justice (Cabuang vs. Hon. Bello, 105 Phil. 1135, 1138).In the instant case, there is no evidence that the first notice was sent to Barrameda's lawyer and that it was delivered to him or should have been received by him. The envelope containing the unclaimed mail was presented in court. The face of the envelope contains the notation \"Returned to sender. Reason: Unclaimed\". Above the stamp, on the back of the envelope, with the legend \"City of San Pablo, Philippines, Jan. 29, 1966\", are written the dates, \"2-3-66 and 2-9-66\". Written also on the back of the envelope are the following: \"R to S, notified 3/3/66\".Relying on those notations on the envelope, the trial court literally and rigidly applied the presumption as to constructive service. It did not require appellee Castillo to present the postmaster's certification that a first notice was sent to Barrameda's lawyer and that the notice was received by the latter.Under those circumstances, the trial court's order dismissing Barrameda's appeal is fraught with injustice. (Emphasis supplied)Here, there is no postmaster's certification that the registered mail was unclaimed by Atty. Cruz, Anita's former counsel, and thus returned to sender after the first notice was sent to and actually received by him on a specified date. Absent such notice, the disputable presumption of completeness of service does not arise and by implication, petitioner could not presume actual receipt by Atty. Cruz.[39]Under Section 4 of Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the special civil action for certiorari should be instituted within a period of 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution sought to be assailed.[40] As there is no conclusive proof of service of the resolution dated 3 February 1999 denying Anita's motion for reconsideration of the NLRC decision, the resolution cannot be deemed to have become final and executory. There is no way in the instant case to determine the reckoning date of the period provided by law for the filing of the special civil action for certiorari. Hence, the Court of Appeals did not lose jurisdiction over Anita's petition for certiorari filed before it.That Anita herself received a copy of the assailed resolution is of no moment. Section 5(a), Rule III of The New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC provides:x x x xFor the purpose of computing the period of appeal, the same shall be counted from receipt of such decisions, awards or orders by the counsel/representative of record.Moreover, jurisprudence teaches that when a party is represented by counsel, notice should be made upon the counsel of record at his given address to which notices of all kinds emanating from the court should be sent in the absence of a proper and adequate notice to the court of a change of address.[41]The service of the court's order upon any person other than the counsel of record is not legally effective and binding upon the party. Neither may it start the corresponding reglementary period for the subsequent procedural steps that may be taken by the attorney. This is because it is the lawyer who is supposed to know the next procedural steps or what ought to be done in law for the protection of the rights of the client, and not the latter.[42] The sending of the copy of the assailed resolution to Anita was not even necessary.WHEREFORE, we GRANT the petition and SET ASIDE the decision of the Court of Appeals. However, petitioner Philemploy Services and Resources, Inc. shall pay respondent Anita Rodriguez P30,000 as nominal damages.

ANITA RODRIGUEZ, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is a petition for review [1] to annul the Decision [2] dated 15 March 2002 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 54386.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals reversed the 11 June 1998 Decision [3] and the 3 February 1999 Resolution [4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (\"NLRC\") in NLRC NCR Case No. ADJ(L)-95-01-0306.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals reinstated the 26 December 1996 Decision of Labor Arbiter Manuel R. Caday.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe facts, as summarized by the Labor Arbiter and adopted in toto by the Court of Appeals and the NLRC, are as follows:\nIn March 1994, complainant Anita Rodriguez applied with respondent Philempl[o]y Services and Resources, Inc. at 36 Main Ave. cor. 8th Ave., Cubao, Quezon City for deployment abroad as a factory worker.\n\nAfter her interview, complainant secured the necessary documentation for her travel, such as passport, medical certificate, NBI clearance, among others, to which she expended the sum of P2,000.00.\n\nIn December 1994, she set out from Cotabato to Manila to report to the office of respondent after she had received a telegram (Annex \"A\") requiring her to report.\n\nMs. Brenda Castro, an official of respondent, demanded from complainant the sum of P60,000.00 as placement fee.\u00a0 Since she could not afford such amount, they agreed that she would have to pay initially the amount of P30,000.00 as downpayment and the balance of P30,000.00, plus 7% interest every month thereafter through salary deductions.\n\nAfter she had pledged her motorcycle and a necklace, she paid\u00a0 Ms. Castro the amount of P30,000.00 plus 10% interest on December 29, 1994, but she was not issued any receipt.\n\nThereafter, she executed a contract of employment as a domestic helper of one Chao Hung Ching of Taipei, Taiwan with a monthly salary of NT$14,010, plus free food and accommodation for a period of one (1) year.\u00a0 (Annexes \"A\" and \"B\")\n\nOn January 11, 1995, she again reported to the office of respondent where another sum of P900.00 for Medicare was required on complainant.\u00a0 After she had pledged her College ring, she paid respondent said amount.\n\nOn January 13, 1995, she was deployed by respondent to the latter's principal arriving in Taiwan later that day.\u00a0 (Annex \"D\")\n\nAs such domestic helper, she worked from 5:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m.\u00a0 Among her chores were to carwash the vehicle of her master, cook the meals, housecleaning and babysitting.\nFor her desire to improve her lot, as well as those she left behind, she weathered all the hardships and loneliness working abroad.\n\nIn the morning of January 24, 1995, she wrote her family in the Philippines of her difficulties as a DH in Taiwan and of her desire to return home after her one-year contract.\u00a0 She requested the wife of [her] master to mail said letter.\u00a0 Later that evening, she had a talk with her master where she was told that she is sending her home on account of\u00a0 certain problems.\u00a0 Complainant pleaded that she continue her employment, confronted as she was with the debts she had to pay.\n\nOn January 25, 1995, complainant was accompanied to the airport by a certain Ms. Go to whom she inquired why she was being repatriated to the Philippines.\u00a0 All that Ms. Go answered was that there was some kind of a problem.\u00a0 While at the airport, Ms. Go forced complainant to sign an Affidavit where it stated, among others, that her leaving as a DH was voluntary and that she would assume all the obligations for her travel back to the Philippines.\u00a0 Since complainant did not want to sign said Affidavit, Ms. Go took complainant to the Office of the Foreign Affairs where, through an immigration police, complainant's passport and plane ticket were given to her.\u00a0 Two policemen accompanied complainant board the plane bound for the Philippines.\n\nFrom January 13 to 24, 1995 or a period of twelve (12) days, complainant was only paid the sum of NT$1,931.00.\n\nIn resisting complainant's allegations, respondent, in its Position Paper with an accompanying Affidavit of Bayani Fontanilla, Jr. and annexes, asserted the following material averments, to wit:\n\nComplainant was hired and deployed for Taiwan as a domestic helper for a one-year contract with principal Chao Hung Ching in Taiwan with a monthly salary of NT$14,010.00.\u00a0 Among other stipulations of the contract, it was agreed that she would undergo a forty (40) days probationary period before she becomes a regular domestic helper.\nIn the course of her recruitment, complainant was personally interviewed through telephone calls by her principal and apprised of the terms and conditions of her employment as a domestic helper in Taiwan.\n\nComplainant was charged of her placement fees as allowed by law and by the POEA rules and regulations.\n\nOn January 13, 1995, complainant departed for Taiwan.\u00a0 It was only on January 15, 1995 when she actually performed her work as a domestic helper after she had undergone an orientation.\n\nDuring the first ten (10) days of her probationary period, complainant was observed to be inattentive and incompetent to perform her duties and responsibilities.\u00a0 She could not cook and do simple things as washing clothes.\u00a0 It was the principal's mother-in-law who did most of the household chores, like babysitting of the child.\u00a0 Worse, complainant was already complaining of the cold weather.\u00a0 However, the principal was nonetheless optimistic that complainant would improve her chores, but to no avail as complainant kept insisting that she be allowed to go home on account of her incapability to perform her job.\u00a0 The complainant even told her foreign employer that \"she had hired a housemaid in their house for more than ten years to do the task.\"\n\nAfter the first ten (10) days' work with the principal employer, complainant returned to the Philippines. [5]\n\nOn 26 December 1996, the Labor Arbiter rendered his decision with the following dispositive portion:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents jointly and severally to pay complainant the sum of P10,900.00 representing the excess placement fee paid by her; the amount of NT$161,115.00 or its peso equivalent in the amount of P155,411.15 representing her unearned wages corresponding to the unexpired portion of her contract; NT$3,492.22 or its peso equivalent in the amount of P3,368.59 representing salary differentials; and ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award due complainant as attorney's fees.\nSO ORDERED. [6]\nPhilemploy Services and Resources, Inc. (\"petitioner\") and Chao Hung Ching appealed to the NLRC. The NLRC rendered its decision on 11 June 1998. The pertinent parts of the decision read as follows:\nRight from the time complainant was accepted as an applicant for the position of Caretaker/Domestic helper, she has already a second thought about said position.\u00a0 Her reason is that it is not the position she applied for.\u00a0 (see No. 7 of complainant's Sinumpaang Salaysay, page 30, record).\u00a0 This statement is not found in the Arbiter's translation into English of such Sinumpaang Salaysay which was adopted by complainant as part of her position paper, and upon which the Labor Arbiter's a quo factual antecedents have been derived.\nIndeed, such omitted material facts coming from complainant herself, is pregnant of bold manifestation that in fact she had difficulty in adjusting herself to the nature of her accepted position different from what was intended.\u00a0 It reinforces thus, respondents' observation that complainant misrepresented herself to her foreign employer that she knows the household chores.\nYet, despite all of these misgivings shown by complainant, her foreign employer was willing to give her time to organize and learn herself the duties and responsibilities attendant to the position of house helper.\u00a0 But the same becomes naught when she insisted to be repatriated before the end of the one-year contract.\nNormally, this Commission does not disturb the factual finding of the Labor Arbiter a quo when supported by substantial evidence.\u00a0 (Union of Filipino Workers vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 98111, April 7, 1993).\n\nBut in this case, We find it more prudent to deviate from said decisional rule to avoid injustice.\n\nWe sympathize with the misfortune of complainant, but factual as well as corroborative circumstances speak loudly against the charge of dismissal.\u00a0 Complainant preferred to go back home earlier than expected.\u00a0 As such, she should not be allowed to utilize this forum as a convenient avenue to enforce a claim which is devoid of factual or legal basis. [7]\nThe dispositive portion of the decision of the NLRC reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view thereof, the appealed decision is hereby modified deleting the award of P155,411.15 representing unearned wages corresponding to the unexpired portion of the contract, there being no illegal dismissal that took place.\n\nIn all other respects, the decision is affirmed.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8]\nAnita Rodriguez (\"Anita\") filed a motion for reconsideration on 3 September 1998. [9]\n\nOn 15 September 1998, Anita filed before the NLRC a Manifestation [10] asserting, inter alia , that \u2014\nWhile it is conceded that respondents had filed their appeal within the period permitted by law yet, it is submitted that the said appeal should not have been entertained on the very simple ground that the surety bond it submitted to perfect their appeal is a \"FAKE\" and \"FORGERIES\" as certified to by no less than NORMA A. VILLANO, Assistant Vice President of the Eastern Assurance & Surety Corporation in her letter dated September 11 and 14, 1998 regarding the surety bonds Nos. G(16)54276 B-2772 in the amount of P118,779.69 and G(16)54194/B-2691 in the amount of P50,000.00, respectively. [11]\nAnita asserted that since petitioner failed to comply with the requirements for perfecting an appeal, no appeal was perfected from the decision of the Labor Arbiter and petitioner's appeal should have been \"outrightly dismissed.\" [12]\n\nThe NLRC denied Anita's motion for reconsideration in its assailed 3 February 1999 Resolution. [13]\n\nOn 17 August 1999, Anita filed a petition for certiorari [14] before the Court of Appeals assailing the decision and resolution of the NLRC.\u00a0 On 23 August 1999, the Court of Appeals issued the following resolution:\nBefore We act on the instant petition for certiorari, the petitioner is directed to inform this Court in writing, within five (5) days from receipt hereof, the date when C. S. Cruz and Associates, her counsel, received a copy of the Resolution dated February 3, 1999 in the case before the National Labor Relations Commission.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15]\nOn 17 April 2000, Anita's new counsel, Emerson C. Tumanon (\"Atty. Tumanon\"), filed with the Court of Appeals his Entry of Appearance and Compliance. [16] Atty. Tumanon asserted that Anita engaged his services as counsel in the present case in view of the death of Anita's former counsel, Ciriaco S. Cruz (\"Atty. Cruz\"), on 26 June 1999.\u00a0 Atty. Tumanon stated that upon verification with the records of the NLRC, he found out that Atty. Cruz never received a copy of the assailed 3 February 1999 Resolution.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nOn 15 March 2002, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment as follows:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the NLRC dated June 11, 1998, as well as its Resolution of February 3, 1999 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.\u00a0 In lieu thereof, the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated December 26, 1996 is hereby REINSTATED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [17]\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that, contrary to the view of the NLRC, the fact that Anita \"had a second thought about her position as a caretaker or domestic helper as it was not the position she applied for, was not pregnant of bold manifestation that in fact she had difficulty in adjusting herself to the nature of her accepted position.\"\u00a0 The Court of Appeals stated that neither would Anita's \"second thoughts\" bolster petitioner's allegation that Anita \"misrepresented to her foreign employer that she knows the house chores.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that petitioner's allegation that Anita did not know her job was incredible.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals stated that the nature of the work given to Anita \"such as car-washing the vehicle of her master, cooking the meals, housecleaning and babysitting, was too simple and menial for an ordinary person of average intelligence to easily learn, especially so for Anita, who is a registered midwife and a family woman.\"\u00a0 The Court of Appeals ruled that even granting that Anita did not know her job, petitioner, who had the duty to evaluate her qualification, should have rejected her application outright.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also ruled that if there is doubt on the credibility of the evidence presented by the parties, the doubt should be resolved in Anita's favor.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals stated that it is a settled rule that in case of doubt, the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the employee.\n\nOn petitioner's claim that the petition for certiorari was filed out of time, the Court of Appeals ruled that the provisions of law pertinent to the issue were Sections 9 and 10, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed to prove that Anita's counsel received the first notice of service of the 3 February 1999 resolution of the NLRC.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals stated that except for petitioner's allegation that Anita's counsel received the first, second, and third notices, and the presentation of the certified true copy of the second notice, there is no sufficient proof that Anita's counsel received the first notice.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also stated that petitioner should have presented the postmaster's certification on the sending of the first notice, which should include the data not only on whether the corresponding notice was issued or sent but also on how, when and to whom delivery of the notice was made.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals held that with petitioner's failure to adduce the required conclusive proof that the postmaster sent the first notice to Anita's counsel, the conclusion was ineluctable that Anita's counsel did not receive the first notice.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals held that there was no way in this case to determine the reckoning date of the period for the filing of the petition for certiorari.\n\nHence, petitioner filed the present petition.\n\nThe Issues\n\nIn assailing the decision of the Court of Appeals, petitioner contends that:\nThe Petition for Certiorari filed by respondent before the Court of Appeals docketed as CA-G.R. No. Sp-54386 was out of time, hence, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the same; and\n\nThe factual findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. Adj. (L) 95-01-0306. [18] The Ruling of the Court\n\nWe find merit in the petition.\n\nPetitioner has raised a factual issue, i.e., whether Anita was illegally dismissed, which is not proper in a petition for review.\u00a0 We have consistently ruled that it is not the function of this Court to assess and evaluate the facts and the evidence again, our jurisdiction being generally limited to reviewing errors of law that might have been committed by the trial court or administrative agency. [19] Nevertheless, since the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the Labor Arbiter are at variance with those of the NLRC, we resolve to review the records and the evidence presented by the parties. [20]\n\nThis Court generally accords respect to the factual findings of the NLRC.\u00a0 However, the rule is equally settled that this Court will not uphold erroneous conclusions of the NLRC if the NLRC's findings of fact on which its conclusions are based are not supported by substantial evidence. [21] Substantial evidence, which is the quantum of evidence required to establish a fact in cases before administrative or quasi-judicial\u00a0 bodies, is that level of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. [22] Factual findings of administrative agencies will be set aside if found arbitrary. [23]\n\nPetitioner assails the appellate court's finding that it was incredible for Anita not to know her job because the nature of work of a domestic helper was easy. Petitioner asserts that the Court of Appeals \"completely overlooked that it was not a matter of learning the job, but it was more on the psychological preparedness of Anita to do menial job, which way back home were being done by her own househelpers.\"\u00a0 Petitioner asserts that it did not say that Anita did not know her job as even petitioner's evaluation of Anita's qualifications was outstanding.\u00a0 Petitioner stresses that Anita's repatriation was of her own accord.\n\nOn the other hand, Anita asserts that all that petitioner has presented were mere self-serving allegations, such as (1) she was not doing her job as domestic helper; (2) she did not know how to wash clothes; (3) she had broken several glasswares of her foreign employer; and (4) when her foreign employer called her attention, she allegedly answered that she used to have her own househelper at home to do the housekeeping chores for her.\u00a0 Anita asserts that petitioner has not adduced any substantial evidence to support its allegations.\n\nAnita also asserts that she did not have second thoughts about accepting the job of domestic helper because she knew how to do the job of a domestic helper.\n\nWe note that in its Position Paper filed before the Labor Arbiter, petitioner pointed out that they had agreed in their employment contract that Anita's placement was subject to a 40-day probationary period. [24] Anita is deemed to have admitted the existence of this stipulation in the employment contract as she never disputed\u00a0 petitioner's assertion in all the pleadings that she submitted to the NLRC, the Court of Appeals, and this Court.\u00a0 Hence, even if it were true that Anita's foreign employer terminated her services after 10 days of her employment, there could be no illegal dismissal as the termination was effected during the agreed probationary period.\n\nThe law in point is Section 6, Rule 1, Book VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, thus \u2014 Probationary employment. There is probationary employment where the employee, upon his engagement, is made to undergo a trial period during which the employer determines his fitness to qualify for regular employment, based on reasonable standards made known to him at the time of engagement.\nProbationary employment shall be governed by the following rules:\n\nx\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\n(c)\u00a0 The services of any employee who has been engaged on probationary basis may be terminated only for a just or authorized cause, when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards prescribed by the employer.\n\n(d) In all cases of probationary employment, the employer shall make known to the employee the standards under which he will qualify as a regular employee at the time of his engagement.\u00a0 Where no standards are made known to the employee at that time, he shall be deemed a regular employee.\nIndeed, an employer, in the exercise of its management prerogative, may hire an employee on a probationary basis in order to determine his fitness to perform his work.\u00a0 The employee's services may be terminated for a just cause or for his failure to qualify as a regular employee based on reasonable standards made known to him at the time of his engagement. [25]\n\nAnita was employed as a domestic helper on a probationary basis.\u00a0 Her foreign employer interviewed her through telephone calls and apprised her of the terms and conditions of her employment as househelper.\u00a0 Upon her arrival at her employer's house in Taiwan, her employer apprised her again of her duties as househelper. [26]\n\nThe findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter which the NLRC and the Court Appeals adopted reveal that Anita's foreign employer was dissatisfied with her performance.\n\nThe law in protecting the rights of the laborer authorizes neither oppression nor self-destruction of the employer.\u00a0 While the Constitution is committed to the policy of social justice and the protection of the working class, it should not be supposed that every labor dispute would automatically be decided in favor of labor. [27]\n\nHowever, although Anita's employment was terminated because she failed to meet the standards of her foreign employer, still it is necessary and obligatory to afford Anita her basic right to notice.\u00a0 Section 2, Rule 1, Book VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code provides:\nSecurity of tenure. (a) In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for just or authorized causes as provided by law, and subject to the requirements of due process.\n\n(b) The foregoing shall also apply in cases of probationary employment; provided, however, that in such cases, termination of employment due to failure of the employee to qualify in accordance with the standards of the employer made known to the former at the time of engagement may also be a ground for termination of employment.\n\nx\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\n\n(d)\u00a0 In all cases of termination of employment, the following\u00a0 standards of due process shall be substantially observed:\n\nx\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\nIf the termination is brought about by the completion of a contract or phase thereof, or by failure of an employee to meet the standards of the employer in the case of probationary employment, it shall be sufficient that a written notice is served the employee within a reasonable time from the effective date of termination. (Emphasis supplied)\nRecords disclose that Anita was repatriated to the Philippines on 25 January 1995.\u00a0 On the night before her departure, her employer's wife merely told her that she was sending her home \"on account of some problem.\"\u00a0 When Anita asked Ms. Go, who accompanied her to the airport the following day, why she was being repatriated, Ms. Go merely answered that \"there was some kind of a problem.\" [28]\n\nThe information given to Anita cannot be considered as equivalent to the written notice required by law to be served on the employee.\u00a0 The notice should inform the employee of the ground or grounds for his termination and that his dismissal is being sought.\n\nThe absence of notice in the present case makes Anita's termination defective for which petitioner must be sanctioned for its non-compliance with the requirements of or for failure to observe due process.\u00a0 Not being a mere technicality but part of procedural due process, to which every employee is entitled to ensure that the employer's prerogative to dismiss is not exercised arbitrarily, this requisite notice must be complied with strictly. [29]\n\nHence, it was incumbent upon Anita's foreign employer to comply with this requirement.\u00a0 This, her employer failed to do, entitling Anita to nominal damages [30] of P30,000 in accordance with recent jurisprudence, [31] to vindicate or recognize her right to procedural due process which was violated by her employer.\n\nIn Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission , [32] this Court held:\nWhere the dismissal is for a just cause, as in the instant case, the lack of statutory due process should not nullify the dismissal, or render it illegal, or ineffectual.\u00a0 However, the employer should indemnify the employee for the violation of his statutory rights, as ruled in Reta v. National Labor Relations Commission. The indemnity to be imposed should be stiffer to discourage the abhorrent practice of \"dismiss now, pay later,\" which we sought to deter in the Serrano ruling.\u00a0 The sanction should be in the nature of indemnification or penalty and should depend on the facts of each case, taking into special consideration the gravity of the due process violation of the employer.\n\nUnder the Civil Code, nominal damages is adjudicated in order that a right of the plaintiff, which has been violated or invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him.\n\nAs enunciated by this Court in Viernes v. National Labor Relations Commission, an employer is liable to pay indemnity in the form of nominal damages to an employee who has been dismissed if, in effecting such dismissal, the employer fails to comply with the requirements of due process.\u00a0 The Court, after considering the circumstances therein, fixed the indemnity at P2,590.50, which was equivalent to the employee's one month salary.\u00a0 This indemnity is intended not to penalize the employer but to vindicate or recognize the employee's right to statutory due process which was violated by the employer.\n\nThe violation of the petitioners' right to statutory due process by the private respondent warrants the payment of indemnity in the form of nominal damages.\u00a0 The amount of such damages is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, taking into account the relevant circumstances. Considering the prevailing circumstances in the case at bar, we deem it proper to fix it at P30,000.00. We believe this form of damages would serve to deter employers from future violations of the statutory due process rights of employees.\u00a0 At the very least, it provides a vindication or recognition of this fundamental right granted to the latter under the Labor Code and its Implementing Rules.\n\nWhile it is no longer necessary to resolve the other issues presented in this petition, still we opt to discuss them one by one.\n\nPetitioner asserts that Anita filed her petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals out of time.\u00a0 According to petitioner, on the envelope containing the assailed 3 February 1999 Resolution are annotations consisting of:\u00a0 (a) Atty. Ciriaco S. Cruz, C. S. Cruz & Associates, Counsel for Complainant, 1801 Int. J. P. Laurel St., San Miguel, Manila; (b) First Notice; (c) Second Notice; (d) Third Notice; and (e) Return to Sender Unclaimed.\u00a0 Petitioner asserts that these annotations reveal how, when, and to whom delivery of the mail was made.\nPetitioner contends that since only the date of the second notice of the postmaster\u00a0 \u2014 23 February 1999 \u2014 is readable, it can be deduced from this that Atty. Cruz constructively received the 3 February 1999 Resolution on 28 February 1999 or five days from 23 February 1999.\n\nPetitioner also argues that it is not necessary to present the postmaster's certification.\u00a0 Petitioner maintains that the annotations on the\u00a0 mail envelope \"can stand on equal footing with and have similar evidentiary value as a postmaster's certification.\"\n\nPetitioner stresses that since Anita's counsel filed the petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals only on 17 August 1999 or more than 60 days from 28 February 1999, the Resolution \"has already assumed finality and the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction over that petition.\"\n\nThese arguments are erroneous.\u00a0 Section 9, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\nService of judgments, final orders or resolutions. \u2014 Judgments, final orders or resolutions shall be served either personally or by registered mail.\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\nSection 10 of the same Rule provides:\nCompleteness of service. \u2014\u00a0 Personal service is complete upon actual delivery.\u00a0 Service by ordinary mail is complete upon the expiration of ten (10) days after mailing, unless the court otherwise provides.\u00a0 Service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt by the addressee, or after five (5) days from the date he received the first notice of the postmaster, whichever date is earlier.\nThe rule on service by registered mail contemplates two situations:\u00a0 (1) actual service the completeness of which is determined upon receipt by the addressee of the registered mail and (2) constructive service the completeness of which is determined upon expiration of five days from the date the addressee received the first notice of the postmaster.\n\nIn the present case, there is no proof of actual receipt of the notice of the registered mail by Anita's counsel.\u00a0 Petitioner merely relied on the\u00a0 envelope which bore the notations \"Return to Sender Unclaimed,\" \"Second Notice 2-23,\" and \"Third Notice\" [33] tending to indicate that the registered mail was returned to sender because it was unclaimed despite the notices sent by the postmaster to the addressee.\u00a0 Petitioner should not have relied on these notations to support the presumption of constructive service. [34] The envelope does not constitute sufficient proof that a first notice was sent by the postmaster, much less, that there was completeness of service. [35]\n\nA party who relies on constructive service or who contends that his adversary has received a copy of a final order or judgment upon the expiration of five days from the date the addressee received the first notice sent by the postmaster must prove that the first notice was actually received by the addressee. [36]\n\nFor completeness of constructive service, there must be conclusive proof that Anita's former counsel had actually received the notice. [37] Such proof requires a certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee.\u00a0 Thus, Section 13 of Rule 13 provides:\nProof of service. \u2014 x x x\u00a0 If service is made by registered mail, proof shall be made by such affidavit and the registry receipt issued by the mailing office.\u00a0 The registry return card shall be filed immediately upon its receipt by the sender, or in lieu thereof of the unclaimed letter together with the certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee .\u00a0 (Emphasis supplied)\nThere must be compliance with Section 13 of Rule 13 on proof of service by registered mail.\u00a0 As the Court ruled in Dela Cruz v. Dela Cruz: [38]\nIn the present case there is no proof of the actual receipt of the notice of the registered mail by counsel for the defendants, Atty. Belen. The trial court merely relied on the notations on the wrapper or envelope of the returned order of September 21, 1965 consisting of \"R & S\", \"unclaimed\" and the stamped box with the wordings \"2nd notice\" and \"last notice\" tending to indicate that the registered mail was returned to sender because it was unclaimed inspite of the notices sent by the postmaster to the addressee therein. The trial court, on the basis of said notations, assumed that the first notice of the postmaster must have been received by defendants on or before November 3, 1965, the date when the order in the envelope was returned to the Urdaneta Post Office. This finding of the court a quo is untenable.\nIn Barrameda vs. Castillo , this Court held:\nTherefore, to obviate injustice, it is incumbent upon a party, who relies on constructive service or who contends that his adversary was served with a copy of a final order or judgment upon the expiration of five days from the first notice of registered mail sent by the postmaster to prove that the first notice was sent and delivered to the addressee. A certification from the postmaster would be the best evidence of that fact (Grafil vs. Feliciano, L-27156, June 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 616). The mailman's testimony may also be adduced to prove that fact, as was done in Aldecoa vs. Hon. Arellano and Siguenza, 113 Phil. 75, 78. The postmaster's certification as to the sending of the first notice \"should include the data not only as to whether or not the corresponding notices were issued or sent but also as to how, when and to whom the delivery thereof was made. \" (Hernandez vs. Navarro, L-28296, November 24, 1972, 48 SCRA 44, 64, per Barredo, J.).\nAs stressed by Justice Barredo in a recent case, \"there must be clear proof of compliance with the postal regulations governing the sending and receipt of the notice referred to in\" section 8 of Rule 13 (Vecino vs. Court of Appeals, L-38612, March 29, 1977). The mere exhibition in court of the envelope containing the unclaimed mail is not sufficient proof that a first notice was sent.\n\nNote that in a certain case a first notice was sent but it was received by the addressee's eleven-year old child who did not deliver it to the addressee himself. It was held that to apply the presumption in that case and to insist on constructive service would work an injustice rather than promote justice (Cabuang vs. Hon. Bello, 105 Phil. 1135, 1138).\n\nIn the instant case, there is no evidence that the first notice was sent to Barrameda's lawyer and that it was delivered to him or should have been received by him. The envelope containing the unclaimed mail was presented in court. The face of the envelope contains the notation \"Returned to sender. Reason: Unclaimed\". Above the stamp, on the back of the envelope, with the legend \"City of San Pablo, Philippines, Jan. 29, 1966\", are written the dates, \"2-3-66 and 2-9-66\". Written also on the back of the envelope are the following: \"R to S, notified 3/3/66\".\n\nRelying on those notations on the envelope, the trial court literally and rigidly applied the presumption as to constructive service. It did not require appellee Castillo to present the postmaster's certification that a first notice was sent to Barrameda's lawyer and that the notice was received by the latter.\n\nUnder those circumstances, the trial court's order dismissing Barrameda's appeal is fraught with injustice.\u00a0 (Emphasis supplied)\nHere, there is no postmaster's certification that the registered mail was unclaimed by Atty. Cruz, Anita's former counsel, and thus returned to sender after the first notice was sent to and actually received by him on a specified date.\u00a0 Absent such notice, the disputable presumption of completeness of service does not arise and by implication, petitioner could not presume actual receipt by Atty. Cruz. [39]\n\nUnder Section 4 of Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the special civil action for certiorari should be instituted within a period of 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution sought to be assailed. [40] As there is no conclusive proof of service of the resolution dated 3 February 1999 denying Anita's motion for reconsideration of the NLRC decision, the resolution cannot be deemed to have become final and executory.\u00a0 There is no way in the instant case to determine the reckoning date of the period provided by law for the filing of the special civil action for certiorari. Hence, the Court of Appeals did not lose jurisdiction over Anita's petition for certiorari filed before it.\n\nThat Anita herself received a copy of the assailed resolution is of no moment.\u00a0 Section 5(a), Rule III of The New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC provides:\nx\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\u00a0 x\n\nFor the purpose of computing the period of appeal, the same shall be counted from receipt of such decisions, awards or orders by the counsel/representative of record.\nMoreover, jurisprudence teaches that when a party is represented by counsel, notice should be made upon the counsel of record at his given address to which notices of all kinds emanating from the court should be sent in the absence of a proper and adequate notice to the court of a change of address. [41]\n\nThe service of the court's order upon any person other than the counsel of record is not legally effective and binding upon the party. Neither\u00a0 may it start the corresponding reglementary period for the subsequent procedural steps that may be taken by the attorney.\u00a0 This is because it is the lawyer\u00a0 who is supposed to know the next procedural steps or what ought to be done in law for the protection of the rights of the client, and not the latter. [42] The sending of the copy of the assailed resolution to Anita was not even necessary.\n\nWHEREFORE , we GRANT the petition and SET ASIDE the decision of the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 However, petitioner Philemploy Services and Resources, Inc. shall pay respondent Anita Rodriguez P30,000 as nominal damages.\u00a0 No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, J., (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio Morales, and Tinga, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[2] Penned by Associate Justice B.

NO. 161823, March 22, 2007 ]\n\nSONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT, INC., PETITIONER, VS. SUPERGREEN, INCORPORATED, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nSONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT, INC., PETITIONER, VS. SUPERGREEN, INCORPORATED, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nThis petition for review seeks to reverse the Decision [1] dated June 30, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 67612 and the Resolution [2] dated January 16, 2004, denying reconsideration. The Court of Appeals had denied the petition for certiorari assailing the trial court's quashal of the search warrant.\n\nThe case stemmed from the complaint filed with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) by petitioner Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc., against respondent Supergreen, Incorporated. The NBI found that respondent engaged in the reproduction and distribution of counterfeit \"PlayStation\" game software, consoles and accessories in violation of Sony Computer's intellectual property rights. Thus, NBI applied with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 1 for warrants to search respondent's premises in Para\u00f1aque City and Cavite. On April 24, 2001, the RTC of Manila issued Search Warrants Nos. 01-1986 to 01-1988 covering respondent's premises at Trece-Tanza Road, Purok 7, Barangay de Ocampo, Trece Martires City, Cavite, and Search Warrants Nos. 01-1989 to 01-1991 covering respondent's premises at Room 302, 3rd Floor Chateau de Baie Condominium, 149 Roxas Boulevard corner Airport Road, Para\u00f1aque City. The NBI simultaneously served the search warrants on the subject premises and seized a replicating machine and several units of counterfeit \"PlayStation\" consoles, joy pads, housing, labels and game software.\n\nOn June 11, 2001, respondent filed a motion to quash Search Warrants Nos. 01-1986 to 01-1988 and/or release of seized properties on the ground that the search warrant failed to particularly describe the properties to be seized. The trial court denied the motion for lack of merit.\n\nOn August 4, 2001, respondent filed another motion to quash, this time, questioning the propriety of the venue. Petitioner opposed the motion on the ground that it violated the omnibus motion rule wherein all objections not included shall be deemed waived. In an Order [3] dated October 5, 2001, the trial court affirmed the validity of Search Warrants Nos. 01-1989 to 01-1991 covering respondent's premises in Para\u00f1aque City, but quashed Search Warrants Nos. 01-1986 to 01-1988 covering respondent's premises in Cavite. The trial court held that lack of jurisdiction is an exception to the omnibus motion rule and may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. The dispositive portion of the order read,\nAccordingly, Search Warrants Nos. 01-1986, 01-1987 and 01-1988 are hereby ordered quashed and set aside.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation and/or any other person in actual custody of the goods seized pursuant thereto are hereby directed to return the same to the respondents.\n\nSO ORDERED. [4]\nPetitioner elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the petition for certiorari. The appellate court ruled that under Section 2, [5] Rule 126 of the Rules of Court, the RTC of Manila had no jurisdiction to issue a search warrant enforceable in Cavite, and that lack of jurisdiction was not deemed waived. Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the same was denied. The Court of Appeals disposed, as follows:\nWHEREFORE, the instant Petition is hereby denied and accordingly DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6]\nPetitioner now comes before us raising the following issues:\nI\n\nWHETHER OR NOT VENUE IN SEARCH WARRANT APPLICATIONS INVOLVES TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.\n\nII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CORRECTNESS OF VENUE IN AN APPLICATION FOR SEARCH WARRANT IS DEEMED WAIVED IF NOT RAISED BY THE RESPONDENT IN ITS MOTION TO QUASH.\n\nIII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE OFFENSES INVOLVED IN THE SUBJECT SEARCH WARRANTS ARE \"CONTINUING CRIMES\" WHICH MAY BE VALIDLY TRIED IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION WHERE THE OFFENSE WAS PARTLY COMMITTED. [7]\nIn sum, we are asked to resolve whether the quashal of Search Warrants Nos. 01-1986 to 01-1988 was valid.\n\nCiting Malaloan v. Court of Appeals, [8] where this Court clarified that a search warrant application is only a special criminal process and not a criminal action, petitioner contends that the rule on venue for search warrant application is not jurisdictional. Hence, failure to raise the objection waived it. Moreover, petitioner maintains that applying for search warrants in different courts increases the possibility of leakage and contradictory outcomes that could defeat the purpose for which the warrants were issued.\n\nPetitioner further asserts that even granting that the rules on search warrant applications are jurisdictional, the application filed either in the courts of the National Capital Region or Fourth Judicial Region is still proper because the crime was continuing and committed in both Para\u00f1aque City and Cavite.\n\nRespondent counters that Section 2 is explicit on where applications should be filed and provided the territorial limitations on search warrants. Respondent claims that Malaloan is no longer applicable jurisprudence with the promulgation of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure. Even granting that petitioner has compelling reasons, respondent maintains that petitioner cannot file the application with the RTC of Manila because Cavite belongs to another judicial region. Respondent also argues that the doctrine on continuing crime is applicable only to the institution of a criminal action, not to search warrant applications which is governed by Rule 126, and in this case Section 2.\n\nTo start, we cautioned that our pronouncement in Malaloan should be read into the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980 [9] conferring on the regional trial courts and their judges a territorial jurisdiction, regional in scope. Both the main decision and the dissent in Malaloan recognized this.\n\nNow, in the present case, respondent's premises in Cavite, within the Fourth Judicial Region, is definitely beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the RTC of Manila, in the National Capital Region. Thus, the RTC of Manila does not have the authority to issue a search warrant for offenses committed in Cavite. Hence, petitioner's reliance in Malaloan is misplaced. Malaloan involved a court in the same judicial region where the crime was committed. The instant case involves a court in another region. Any other interpretation re-defining territorial jurisdiction would amount to judicial legislation. [10]\n\nNonetheless, we agree with petitioner that this case involves a transitory or continuing offense of unfair competition under Section 168 of Republic Act No. 8293, [11] which provides,\nSEC. 168. Unfair Competition, Rights, Regulation and Remedies . -...\n\n168.2. Any person who shall employ deception or any other means contrary to good faith by which he shall pass off the goods manufactured by him or in which he deals, or his business, or services for those of the one having established such goodwill, or who shall commit any acts calculated to produce said result, shall be guilty of unfair competition, and shall be subject to an action therefor.\n\n168.3. In particular, and without in any way limiting the scope of protection against unfair competition, the following shall be deemed guilty of unfair competition:\n\n(a) Any person, who is selling his goods and gives them the general appearance of goods of another manufacturer or dealer, either as to the goods themselves or in the wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or the devices or words thereon, or in any other feature of their appearance, which would be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered are those of a manufacturer or dealer, other than the actual manufacturer or dealer, or who otherwise clothes the goods with such appearance as shall deceive the public and defraud another of his legitimate trade, or any subsequent vendor of such goods or any agent of any vendor engaged in selling such goods with a like purpose;\n\n(b) Any person who by any artifice, or device, or who employs any other means calculated to induce the false belief that such person is offering the services of another who has identified such services in the mind of the public; or\n\n(c) Any person who shall make any false statement in the course of trade or who shall commit any other act contrary to good faith of a nature calculated to discredit the goods, business or services of another.\nPertinent too is Article 189 (1) of the Revised Penal Code that enumerates the elements of unfair competition, to wit:\n(a) That the offender gives his goods the general appearance of the goods of another manufacturer or dealer;\n\n(b) That the general appearance is shown in the (1) goods themselves, or in the (2) wrapping of their packages, or in the (3) device or words therein, or in (4) any other feature of their appearance;\n\n(c) That the offender offers to sell or sells those goods or gives other persons a chance or opportunity to do the same with a like purpose; and\n\n(d) That there is actual intent to deceive the public or defraud a competitor. [12]\nRespondent's imitation of the general appearance of petitioner's goods was done allegedly in Cavite. It sold the goods allegedly in Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila. The alleged acts would constitute a transitory or continuing offense. Thus, clearly, under Section 2 (b) of Rule 126, Section 168 of Rep. Act No. 8293 and Article 189 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, petitioner may apply for a search warrant in any court where any element of the alleged offense was committed, including any of the courts within the National Capital Region (Metro Manila). [13]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated June 30, 2003 and the Resolution dated January 16, 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 67612 are SET ASIDE . The Order dated October 5, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 1, is PARTLY MODIFIED .

Cruz, Manila. \u00a0The apprehending police officers claimed that he and four other persons were sniffing methamphetamine hydrochloride, more popularly known as shabu, a regulated drug; and that he was in possession of an unlicensed .38 caliber revolver\n\nOn December 9, 1996, the City Prosecutor of Manila filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 53, same city, two separate Informations against respondent, one for illegal possession of methamphetamine hydrochloride, docketed as Criminal Case No. 96-154398, and another for illegal possession of firearm, docketed as Criminal Case No. 96-154399, reproduced as follows:\nCriminal Case No. Case 96-154398\n\nThat on or about November 19, 1996, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused without being authorized by law to possess or use any regulated drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his custody and control white crystalline substance separately contained in five (5) plastic bags marked \u201cAJ\u201d to \u201cAJ4\u201d weighting two hundred twenty and .2462 (222.2462) grams known as \u201cShabu\u201d containing methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug, without the corresponding license or prescription thereof.\n\nCriminal Case No. 96-154399,\n\nThat on or about November 19, 1996, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his/her possession and under his/her custody and control .38 caliber revolver without serial number with six (6) live ammos and carrying the same outside his residence without first having secured from the proper authorities the necessary license therefore.\nNo bail was recommended in Criminal Case No. 96-154398.\n\nOn December 18, 1996, respondent filed with the trial court a motion for reinvestigation on grounds that he was apprehended without a warrant of arrest and that no preliminary investigation was conducted.\n\nOn January 28, 1997, the trial court granted respondent\u2019s motion.\n\nOn April 14, 1998, Prosecutor Virgilio Patag, designated to conduct the reinvestigation, was appointed judge of the RTC in Iloilo. \u00a0\u00a0Apparently, he did not inform the prosecutor who took his place about the pending reinvestigation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, respondent has remained in detention.\n\nOn January 4, 2001, respondent filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the Informations, contending that the delay in the reinvestigation violated his right to due process.\n\nOn January 12, 2001, the trial court heard the motion to dismiss. \u00a0\u00a0It turned out that Prosecutor Danilo Formoso, who took over the case, was not aware of the pending reinvestigation. \u00a0The trial court then directed him to terminate the reinvestigation within thirty (30) days.\n\nOn February 16, 2001, Prosecutor Formoso manifested before the trial court that the reinvestigation had been terminated and that evidence exist to sustain the allegations in the Informations against respondent.\n\nOn August 9, 2001, the trial court issued an Order denying respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the Informations.\u00a0\u00a0 His motion for reconsideration was likewise denied in an Order dated September 7, 2001.\n\nRespondent then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 67531, contending that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying his motion to dismiss both Informations.\n\nOn October 11, 2002, the Court of Appeals granted the petition and set aside the Order of the trial court dated August 9, 2001 and dismissed the criminal charges against respondent.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that having been made to wait for the resolution of his motion for reinvestigation for almost five years while being detained, violated his right to due process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Court of Appeals then ordered that respondent be released from custody.\n\nThe Government, represented by the Solicitor General, moved for reconsideration, but in its Resolution dated January 10, 2003, the Court of Appeals denied the same.\n\nThe only issue before us is whether the appellate court erred in holding that respondent\u2019s right to due process has been violated.\n\nPhilippine organic and statutory law expressly guarantees that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy his right to a speedy trial.\u00a0 Section 16, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that \u201cAll persons shall have the right to speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.\u201d\u00a0 This is reinforced by Section 3(f), Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, which requires that \u201cthe investigating officer shall resolve the case within ten (10) days from the conclusion of the investigation.\u201d\u00a0 To ensure a speedy trial of all criminal cases before the Sandiganbayan, Regional Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court and Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Republic Act No. 8493 (The Speedy Trial Act of 1998) was enacted on February 4, 1998.\u00a0 To implement its provisions, the Court issued SC Circular No. 38-98 dated September 15, 1998 setting a time limit for arraignment and pre-trial for thirty (30) days from the date the court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the accused.\n\nThe earliest rulings of the Court on speedy trial were rendered in Conde v. Judge of First Instance, [2] Conde v. Rivera, et al., [3] and People v. Casta\u00f1eda. [4] These cases held that accused persons are guaranteed a speedy trial by the Bill of Rights and that such right is denied when an accused person, through the vacillation and procrastination of prosecuting officers, is forced to wait many months for trial. \u00a0Specifically in Casta\u00f1eda , the Court called on courts to be the last to set an example of delay and oppression in the administration of justice and it is the moral and legal obligation of the courts to see to it that the criminal proceedings against the accused come to an end and that they be immediately discharged from the custody of the law.\n\nIn Angcangco, Jr. v. Ombudsman , [5] the Court found the delay of six years by the Ombudsman in resolving the criminal complaints to be violative of the constitutionally guaranteed right to a speedy disposition of cases.\u00a0 Similarly, in Roque v. Office of the Ombudsman , [6] the Court ruled that the delay of almost six years disregarded the Ombudsman\u2019s duty to act promptly on complaints before him.\u00a0 In Cervantes v. Sandiganbayan , [7] it was held that the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in not quashing the Information filed six years after the initiatory complaint, thereby depriving petitioner of his right to a speedy disposition of the case.\n\nThe inordinate delay in terminating the preliminary investigation of an accused violates his constitutional right to due process.\u00a0 Thus, in Roque v. Sandiganbayan , [8] the Court, restating the pronouncement in Tatad v. Sandiganbayan , [9] held:\nWe find the long delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation by the Tanodbayan in the instant case to be violative of the constitutional right of the accused to due process.\u00a0 Substantial adherence to the requirements of the law governing the conduct of preliminary investigation, including substantial compliance with the time limitation prescribed by the law for the resolution of the case by the prosecutor, is part of the procedural due process constitutionally guaranteed by the fundamental law. Not only under the broad umbrella of due process clause, but under the constitutional guaranty of \u201cspeedy disposition\u201d of cases as embodied in Section 16 of the Bill of Rights (both in the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions), the inordinate delay is violative of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.\u00a0 A delay of close to three (3) years cannot be deemed reasonable or justifiable in the light of the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar. We are not impressed by the attempt of the Sandiganbayan to sanitize the long delay by indulging in the speculative assumption that \u201cdelay may be due to a painstaking and grueling scrutiny by the Tanodbayan as to whether the evidence presented during the preliminary investigation merited prosecution of a former high-ranking government official.\u201d\u00a0 In the first place, such a statement suggests a double standard of treatment, which must be emphatically rejected.\u00a0 Secondly, three out of the five charges against the petitioner were for his alleged failure to file his sworn statement of assets and liabilities required by Republic Act 3019, which certainly did not involve complicated legal and factual issues necessitating such \u201cpainstaking and grueling scrutiny\u201d as would justify a delay of almost three years in terminating the preliminary investigation.\u00a0 The other two charges relating to alleged bribery and alleged giving [of] unwarranted benefits to a relative, while presenting more substantial legal and factual issues, certainly do not warrant or justify the period of three years, which it took the Tanodbayan to resolve the case.\u00a0 (Emphasis supplied).\nThe preliminary investigation of the respondent for the offenses charged took more than four years.\u00a0 He was apprehended for the offenses charged on November 19, 1996.\u00a0 Having been arrested without a warrant of arrest and not having been afforded a formal investigation, he prayed for reinvestigation of the cases.\u00a0 The trial court, in an Order dated January 28, 1997 ordered a reinvestigation which was terminated only on February 16, 2001.\u00a0 In fact, even the Solicitor General admitted \u201cit took some time for the City Prosecutor to terminate and resolve the reinvestigation.\n\nThere can be no question that respondent was prejudiced by the delay, having to be confined for more than four oppressive years for failure of the investigating prosecutors to comply with the law on preliminary investigation.\u00a0 As aptly held by the Court of Appeals, respondent\u2019s right to due process had been violated.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court DENIES the petition and AFFIRMS the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

CEZAR, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nMARILI C. RONQUILLO, ALEXANDER RONQUILLO AND JON ALEXANDER RONQUILLO, REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT SERVILLANO A. CABUNGCAL, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. HOMOBONO T. CEZAR, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPUNO, J.:\n\nComplainants seek the disbarment or suspension of respondent from the practice of law for unlawful, dishonest, immoral and deceitful conduct.\u00a0 They allege that respondent sold them a piece of property over which he has no right nor interest, and that he refuses to return to them the amount they have paid him for it.\n\nComplainant Marili C. Ronquillo is a Filipino citizen currently residing in Cannes, France, together with her minor children, Alexander and Jon Alexander.\n\nIn May 1999, complainants and respondent entered into a Deed of Assignment. [1] For the price of P1.5M, respondent transferred, in favor of the complainants, his rights and interests over a townhouse unit and lot, located at 75 Granwood Villas Subd., BF Homes, Quezon City.\u00a0 Respondent also obligated himself to deliver to complainants a copy of the Contract to Sell he executed with Crown Asia, the townhouse developer, dated April 19, 1996. Upon full payment of the purchase price, respondent further undertook to have Crown Asia execute a Deed of Absolute Sale over the property in favor of the complainants.\n\nRespondent received from complainants P750,000.00 upon execution of the Deed of Assignment.\u00a0 The balance was to be paid by complainants in four equal quarterly installments of P187,500.00 each.\u00a0 Thus, complainants issued in favor of respondent four postdated checks in the amount of P187,500.00 each.\u00a0 Respondent was able to encash the first check dated August 17, 1999. [2]\n\nComplainants subsequently received information from Crown Asia that respondent has not paid in full the price of the townhouse at the time he executed the Deed of Assignment.\u00a0 Respondent also failed to deliver to complainants a copy of the Contract to Sell he allegedly executed with Crown Asia.\u00a0 For these reasons, complainant Marili Ronquillo ordered the bank to stop payment on the second check she issued to respondent in the amount of P187,500.00.\n\nOn March 6, 2000, complainants, through their counsel, wrote respondent, informing him that they were still willing to pay the balance of the purchase price of the townhouse on the condition that respondent work on Crown Asia's execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale in their favor.\u00a0 In the alternative, complainants demanded the return of the amount of P937,500.00, plus legal interest, within ten days. [3] The amount of P937,500.00 represents the P750,000.00 down payment and the first quarterly installment of P187,500.00 which complainants paid respondent.\n\nIn a letter dated May 2, 2000, addressed to complainants, [4] respondent claimed that he was \"working now on a private project which hopefully will be realized not long from now,\" and requested for \"a period of twenty days from May 15, 2000 within which to either completely pay Crown Asia or return the money at your (complainants') option.\" The period lapsed but respondent did not make good his promise to pay Crown Asia in full, or return the amount paid by complainants.\n\nOn February 21, 2002, complainants' counsel sent respondent a second letter [5] demanding the return of the amount of P937,500.00, including legal interest, for failing to comply with his promise.\u00a0 The demand was unheeded.\n\nHence, this administrative complaint [6] that respondent engaged in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.\u00a0 Allegedly, respondent violated his oath under Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and he ought to be disbarred or suspended from the practice of law.\n\nIntegrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Investigating Commissioner Milagros V. San Juan, to whom the instant disciplinary case was assigned for investigation, report and recommendation, found respondent guilty of dishonest and deceitful conduct proscribed under Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. \u00a0In her Report dated October 9, 2003, she recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of three (3) years.\u00a0 The IBP Board of Governors, through Resolution No. XVI-2003-226, dated October 25, 2003, approved the recommendation of Commissioner San Juan.\n\nWe agree.\n\nUnder Section 27, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court, a member of the Bar may be disbarred or suspended on any of the following grounds:\u00a0 (1) deceit ; (2) malpractice or other gross misconduct in office; (3) grossly immoral conduct ; (4) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude; (5) violation of the lawyer's oath; (6) willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court; and (7) willfully appearing as an attorney for a party without authority.\u00a0 Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides that \"A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct .\"\u00a0 \"Conduct,\" as used in this rule, does not refer exclusively to the performance of a lawyer's professional duties.\u00a0 This Court has made clear in a long line of cases [7] that a lawyer may be disbarred or suspended for misconduct, whether in his professional or private capacity, which shows him to be wanting in moral character, honesty, probity and good demeanor, or unworthy to continue as an officer of the court.\n\nIn the instant case, respondent may have acted in his private capacity when he entered into a contract with complainant Marili representing to have the rights to transfer title over the townhouse unit and lot in question.\u00a0 When he failed in his undertaking, respondent fell short of his duty under Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\u00a0 It cannot be gainsaid that it was unlawful for respondent to transfer property over which one has no legal right of ownership.\u00a0 Respondent was likewise guilty of dishonest and deceitful conduct when he concealed this lack of right from complainants.\u00a0 He did not inform the complainants that he has not yet paid in full the price of the subject townhouse unit and lot, and, therefore, he had no right to sell, transfer or assign said property at the time of the execution of the Deed of Assignment.\u00a0 His acceptance of the bulk of the purchase price amounting to Nine Hundred Thirty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P937,500.00), despite knowing he was not entitled to it, made matters worse for him.\n\nRespondent's adamant refusal to return to complainant Marili Ronquillo the money she paid him, which was the fruit of her labor as an Overseas Filipino Worker for ten (10) years, is morally reprehensible.\u00a0 By his actuations, respondent failed to live up to the strict standard of morality required by the Code of Professional Responsibility and violated the trust and respect reposed in him as a member of the Bar, and an officer of the court.\n\nRespondent's culpability is therefore clear.\u00a0 He received a letter from complainants' counsel demanding the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of the complainants, or, in the alternative, the return of the money paid by complainants. In reply to said letter, respondent \u00a0acknowledged his obligation, and promised to settle the same if given sufficient time, thus: x x x\n\nI am working now on a private project which hopefully will be realized not long from now but I need a little time to fix some things over.\u00a0 May I please request for a period of 20 days from May 15, 2000 within which to either completely pay Crown Asia or return the money at your option. (Emphasis supplied) In no uncertain terms, respondent admitted not having full ownership over the subject townhouse unit and lot, as he has yet to completely pay Crown Asia . Respondent even failed to produce the Contract to Sell he allegedly executed with Crown Asia over the subject unit, which would show the extent of his right of ownership, if any, over the townhouse unit and lot in question.\n\nTo be sure, complainants gave respondent sufficient time to fulfill his obligation.\u00a0 It was only after almost two years had passed, after respondent promised to pay Crown Asia or return to complainants the amount they paid him, that complainants sent respondent a second letter [8] demanding solely the return of the amount of P937,500.00, including legal interest.\u00a0 By this time, it was indubitable that \u00a0respondent would not be able to perform his end of their agreement.\n\nThe practice of law is not a right but a privilege.\u00a0 It is granted only to those of good moral character. [9] The Bar must maintain a high standard of honesty and fair dealing. [10] Lawyers must conduct themselves beyond reproach at all times, whether they are dealing with their clients or the public at large, [11] and a violation of the high moral standards of the legal profession justifies the imposition of the appropriate penalty, including suspension and disbarment. [12]\n\nBe that as it may, we cannot grant complainants' prayer that respondent be directed to return the money he received from them in the amount of P937,500.00.\u00a0 Disciplinary proceedings against lawyers do not involve a trial of an action, but rather investigations by the court into the conduct of one of its officers.\u00a0 The only question for determination in these proceedings is whether or not the attorney is still fit to be allowed to continue as a member of the Bar. [13] Thus, this Court cannot rule on the issue of the amount of money that should be returned to the complainants.\n\nIN VIEW WHEREOF, respondent Atty. Homobono T. Cezar is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of THREE (3) YEARS , effective immediately.\u00a0 Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and all courts for their information and guidance.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Quisumbing, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Garcia, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\nYnares-Santiago, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Annexes \"C\" to \"C-1\"; rollo , pp. 13-14.\n\n[2] Annex \"D\"; id at 15.\n\n[3] Annexes \"E\" to \"E-1\"; id at 16-17.\n\n[4] Annex \"F\"; id at 18.\n\n[5] Annexes \"G\" to \"G-1\"; id at 19-20.\n\n[6] Id at 1-20.\n\n[7] Lao v.

TAYAO AND GLICERIO PEREZ, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nAssailed via Petition for Review on Certiorari are the September 28, 2004 Decision [1] and January 25, 2005 Order [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati, Branch 59 affirming the July 22, 2002 Order [3] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati, Branch 65 granting the \u201cMotion to Withdraw Informations and to Dismiss the [Criminal] Cases\u201d filed against respondents Ramon P. Jacinto (Jacinto), Jaime C. Colayco (Colayco), Antonio P. Tayao (Tayao) and Glicerio Perez (Perez) for falsification of private document and grave coercion.\n\nFirst Women\u2019s Credit Corp. (the corporation), represented by stockholder and director Shig Katayama (Katayama), filed on November 12, 1997 a petition before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the corporation\u2019s officers Jacinto, Colayco, Concepcion T. Sangil (Sangil) and Asuncion Cruz (Cruz), for alleged mismanagement of the corporation.\u00a0 The case was docketed as SEC No. 11-97-5816. [4]\n\nThe SEC, in SEC Case No. 11-97-5816, created an Interim Management Committee (IMC) for the corporation by Order of November 17, 1999.\u00a0 The Order was upheld by the SEC en banc on July 4, 2000.\n\nThe IMC thereupon issued directives to the corporation\u2019s president Antonio Tayao (Tayao) and corporate secretary and treasurer Glicerio Perez (Perez) toward the preservation of assets and records of the corporation. [5]\n\nAllegedly in conspiracy with Jacinto and Colayco, Tayao and Perez defied the implementation of the SEC November 17, 1999 Order [6] when IMC attempted to enter the main office of the corporation in Makati on December 3, 1999, December 29, 1999 and January 28, 2000. [7]\n\nOn April 6, 2000, Tayao filed a request with the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID) to include Katayama in its watch list.\n\nThe IMC, on April 14, 2000, later preventively suspended Tayao and Perez. Despite their preventive suspension, however, the two, allegedly in conspiracy with Jacinto and Colayco, still issued various directives/memoranda to the employees of the corporation to disobey the IMC.\n\nOn May 9, 2000, the IMC dismissed Tayao and Perez. [8]\n\nIn two follow-up letters to the BID both dated August 1, 2000, Tayao represented himself as president of the corporation. [9]\n\nHence, the filing before the Makati City Prosecutor\u2019s Office (CPO) on December 27, 2000 of criminal complaints against Jacinto, Colayco, Tayao and Perez by the corporation, represented by Katayama, for violation of the following offenses defined and punishable under the Revised Penal Code:\na)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 151 which punishes resistance and disobedience to person in authority or the agents of such person (20 counts);\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 154 which punishes the unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances (2 counts);\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 172(2) which punishes falsification by private individuals and use of falsified documents (2 counts);\n\nd)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 315, paragraph 2(a) Estafa by falsely pretending to be officers of FWCC (23 counts). [10]\nJacinto, Colayco, Tayao and Perez (hereafter respondents) denied the charges. [11] They claimed that the SEC Order creating the IMC was pending appeal at the Court of Appeals; [12] that there was no danger that the assets of the corporation would be dissipated or lost at the time the alleged criminal acts were committed; and that Katayama had no authority to institute the criminal charges in behalf of the corporation as he was merely a minority stockholder, aside from his lack of personal knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to the filing of the charges. [13]\n\nThe Investigating Prosecutor, by Resolution of August 28, 2001, found probable cause to hale respondents into court for falsification of private documents under Article 172(2), and three informations for grave coercion against private respondent Tayao and three unnamed security guards. The decretal text of the resolution reads:\nWherefore, finding sufficient evidence to charge respondents Ramon P. Jacinto, Jaime P. Colayco, Antonio P. Tayao and Glicerio Perez for the offense of Falsification of Private Document under Art. 172(2) on two (2) counts and, only as against respondent Tayao with three (3) other unnamed security guards, three (3) counts of Grave Coercion under Art. 286, both of the Revised Penal Code, but insufficient evidence for the offenses defined under Articles 151, 154 and 315, 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code as against all four (4) respondents, the undersigned respectfully recommends that the charges for the latter three (3) offenses as against all respondents be dismissed for insufficiency of evidence as these are dismissed upon approval but the attached informations be approved for filing in court.\n\nx x x x [14]\nIn finding probable cause, the Investigating Prosecutor declared:\nOn the other hand, there is sufficient evidence for the charge of Falsification of Private Document as defined in Art. 172 (2) against respondents as the two (2) letters addressed to the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation both dated 1 August 2000 but the first, received at the BID on 10 August 2000 and the second, on 21 August 2000, clearly showed that respondents colluded and connived with each other in making it appear in the said letters that respondent Tayao was the President of complainant FWCC when as early as 9 May 2000, he has already been dismissed as officer of the said corporation by the Management Committee. It has also been shown that as a result of these two (2) letters, complainant Katayama suffered not only pecuniary and material damage but also damage to his honor as well.\n\nFinally, sufficient evidence has shown that respondent Tayao and three (3) other armed security guards whose identities can be established later, without authority of law, with the use of physical force and threats, prevented the Management committee from implementing their legal mandate on 3 December 1999, on 29 December 1999 and 28 January 2000, by refusing them entry into the FWCC\u2019s main office at 51 Polaris St., Makati City. They may therefore be held liable for Grave Coercion under Art. 286 of the Revised Penal Code. No evidence, however, has been presented showing the other respondents\u2019 culpable participation in these three (3) aforementioned instances. [15] (Underscoring supplied)\nThe City Prosecutor approved the Investigating Prosecutor\u2019s resolution.\n\nRespondents appealed the CPO resolution to the Department of Justice (DOJ) via Petition for Review.\n\nThe DOJ, by Resolution [16] dated April 29, 2002, reversed the Resolution of the CPO which was directed to move for the withdrawal of the information for falsification of private document against private respondents and the informations for grave coercion against respondent Tayao and the three John Does.\n\nThe corporation and Katayama (hereafter petitioners) moved to reconsider the DOJ April 29, 2002 Resolution but it was denied by Resolution of September 24, 2002. [17]\n\nPetitioners thereupon assailed the DOJ Resolutions before the Court of Appeals via petition for certiorari. [18]\n\nIn the meantime, respondents filed with Branch 65, MeTC Makati where the criminal cases were raffled, a \u201cMotion to Withdraw Informations and to Dismiss the Cases\u201d [19] to which motion petitioners filed their Opposition. [20] By Order [21] of July 22, 2002, Acting Presiding Judge Rommel Baybay found respondents\u2019 motion to be well-taken and accordingly dismissed the criminal cases.\n\nPetitioners\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration of the July 22, 2002 Order of the trial court was denied by Order [22] of December 3, 2002.\n\nPetitioners assailed the trial court\u2019s orders via certiorari with the RTC of Makati which Branch 59 thereof dismissed by Decision [23] of September 28, 2004 for lack of merit.\n\nIn denying their petition for certiorari, the RTC held that the grounds relied upon by petitioners were mere errors of judgment, not necessarily of jurisdiction, and there being other legal remedies to question the assailed orders, e.g., the filing of a Notice of Appeal, petitioners\u2019 petition for certiorari would not lie. [24]\n\nHence, the instant petition for review on certiorari filed directly with this Court, petitioners contending that\nIN ISSUING THE ASSAILED RTC DECISION AND ASSAILED RTC ORDER, THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT DECIDED NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW AND APPLICABLE JURISPRUDENCE, IN THAT:\nPURSUANT TO PEREZ V. HAGONOY RURAL BANK AND DEE V. COURT OF APPEALS , PETITIONERS\u2019 ONLY REMEDY FROM THE ASSAILED MTC ORDERS WAS A PETITION FOR CERTIORARI AND NOT AN ORDINARY APPEAL.\n\nCONTRARY TO ROBERTS V. COURT OF APPEALS , THE METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT FAILED TO DISCHARGE ITS JUDICIAL MANDATE TO MAKE AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.\n\nAN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD ESTABLISHES THE EXISTENCE OF PROBABLE CAUSE THAT RESPONDENTS COMMITTED FALSIFICATION OF PRIVATE DOCUMENTS AND GRAVE COERCION. [25] (Italics in the original)\nIt is settled that the determination of whether probable cause exists to warrant the prosecution in court of an accused should be consigned and entrusted to the Department of Justice, as reviewer of the findings of public prosecutors. [26] The court\u2019s duty in an appropriate case is confined to a determination of whether the assailed executive or judicial determination of probable cause was done without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to want of jurisdiction. This is consistent with the general rule that criminal prosecutions may not be restrained or stayed by injunction, preliminary or final, [27] albeit in extreme cases, exceptional circumstances have been recognized. [28] The rule is also consistent with this Court\u2019s policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, and of leaving to the investigating prosecutor sufficient latitude of discretion in the exercise of determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence as will establish probable cause for the filing of an information against a supposed offender. [29]\n\nWhile prosecutors are given sufficient latitude of discretion in the determination of probable cause, their findings are subject to review by the Secretary of Justice. [30]\n\nOnce a complaint or information is filed in court, however, any disposition of the case, e.g. , its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests on the sound discretion of the Court. [31]\n\nIn thus resolving a motion to dismiss the case or to withdraw the Information filed by the public prosecutor on his own initiative or pursuant to the directive of the Secretary of Justice, either for insufficiency of evidence or for lack of probable cause, the trial court should not rely solely and merely on the findings of the public prosecutor or the Secretary of Justice that no crime was committed or that the evidence in the possession of the public prosecutor is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction of the accused. [32] It is its bounden duty to independently assess the merits of the motion. For while the ruling of the Secretary of Justice is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. [33]\n\nAs to what mode of review petitioners may avail of after a court grants an accused\u2019s motion to withdraw information and/or to dismiss the case, Section 1 of Rule 122 of the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure instructs:\u00a0 \u201cAny party may appeal from a judgment or final order, unless the accused will be placed in double jeopardy.\u201d\n\nIn availing of the remedy of certiorari before the RTC, petitioners claim that they had no plain, adequate and speedy remedy to question the MeTC\u2019s grant of the motion.\n\nThe records of the cases show, however, that the motion was granted by the MeTC before respondents were arraigned. Thus, the prohibition against \u00a0appeal \u00a0in \u00a0case a criminal case is dismissed as the accused would be placed in double jeopardy does not apply.\n\nPetitioners not having availed of the proper remedy to assail the dismissal of the cases, the dismissal had become final and executory.\u00a0\u00a0 On this score alone, the present petition must fail.\n\nTechnicality aside, the petition just the same fails.\n\nPetitioners\u2019 assertion that the trial court failed to comply with its mandate to make an independent assessment and evaluation of the evidence before granting the motion does not persuade.\n\nThe trial court did stress in its December 3, 2002 Order [34] denying the motion for reconsideration that it was bound to make, as it did, a preliminary finding independently of those of the Secretary of Justice.\n\nThe trial judge need not state with specificity or make a lengthy exposition of the factual and legal foundation relied upon by him to arrive at his decision. \u00a0It suffices that upon his own personal evaluation of the evidence and the law involved in the case, he is convinced that there is no probable cause to indict the accused.\n\nThe trial judge\u2019s grant of the motion after his independent finding that there was indeed lack of probable cause to indict respondents should not then be brushed aside absent any evidence showing that he overlooked relevant and material facts which, if considered, would glaringly point to the presence of probable cause.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n*\u00a0 Being assailed in the present petition are the issuances of the Makati Regional Trial Court .\u00a0 At any rate, Section 4 of Rule 45 provides that in petitions for review on certiorari, the lower courts or judges either as petitioners or respondents are not to be impleaded.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 40-45.

      "title": "those requisites is absent, the land is not covered under OLT.x x x xThus, on one hand, exemption from coverage of OLT lies if: (1) the land is not devoted to rice or corn crops even if it is tenanted; or (2) the land is untenanted even though it is devoted to rice or corn crops.\"Guided by the foregoing, it is essential to determine whether or not tenancy relationship exists between Mr. Arroyo and the appellees. In the absence of the all important element of tenancy, the subject land falls outside OLT coverage of PD 27 even if incidentally it is devoted to rice and/or corn. In the case of Prudential Bank vs. Gapultos, 181 SCRA 160 [1990], the Supreme Court lists the requisites essential for the establishment of tenancy relationship, thus:\"The essential requisites of tenancy relationship are: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject is agricultural land; (3) there is consent; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation; and (6) there is sharing of harvests. All these requisites must concur in order to create a tenancy relationship between the parties. The absence of one does not make an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon, a de jure tenant. Unless a person has established his status as a de jure tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by Land Reform Program of the government under existing tenancy laws.\"x x x xApplying the above-stated requirements in the case at bar, we find the absence of tenancy relationship between the parties. Firstly, subject land is not an agricultural land, as the term is understood. Uncontroverted evidence shows that the subject land had been classified as residential/commercial even prior to the effectivity of PD 27. Per Official Zoning Map of the City of Davao adopted under Resolution No. 711, Ordinance No. 281, s. of 1972 (p. 243, Records), the land was classified as \"Commercial Zone and Residential Zone Class B\". This classification confirmed the residential character of the subject land as appearing in Mr. Arroyo's tax declarations filed way back in 1968 (pp. 187-190, Records). x x xThe residential character of the subject property is likewise confirmed by the following government agencies or offices:1. The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), Davao City, which issued a Zoning Certification to the effect that the subject land is within the Residential/Commercial Zone under the Zoning Ordinance of Davao City adopted through a Sangguniang Bayan Resolution and ratified by the HLURB, through Board Resolution No. 39-4, s. of 1980 dated July 31, 1980 (p. 208, Records).2. The Office of the Zoning Administrator, City of Davao, certifying to the effect that the subject land is within a Residential Zone Class \"B\" in the Zonification Ordinance of Davao City (p. 126, Records).3. The Bureau of Soils of then Ministry of Agriculture, Davao City, which submitted a Certification to the effect that the subject land is suitable for urban use/housing projects (p. 127, Records).4. The Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator, Office of the Zoning Administrator, certifying to the effect that the subject land was classified as Major Commercial Zone (C-2) and High Density Residential Zone (R-2) in the City Ordinance No. 363, s. of 1982 or better known as Expanded Zoning Ordinance of Davao City (p. 160, Records).To cap it all, even the DAR Provincial Task Force on Illegal Conversion, after conducting on April 10, 2000 an investigation on the reported illegal conversion of the subject land, admitted on its report of June 2, 2000 that it is no longer agricultural, it being classified as commercial and residential zones. Consequently, they ruled out any act of illegal conversion.Secondly, the records show that the land in dispute was never intended for agricultural production. For one, no agricultural improvements were introduced upon the land since its acquisition by Mr. Arroyo in 1951. In fact, for more than a decade since 1972, the disputed land was subject of numerous business proposals (attached to Appeal/Memorandum) from various land developers for purposes of developing it into a residential and commercial area. For another, the subject property is situated in a commercial and residential area. As the records show, it is adjacent to the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) subdivision and other residential or commercial establishments, and surrounded by GSIS Heights, Villa Josefina Subdivision, Flores Village, Central Park Subdivision, Poly Subdivision, San Miguel Village, New Matina Golf Club, Davao Memorial Park, Shrine of the Infant Jesus, Matina Public Market and Venees hotel.The fact that appellees may perhaps have planted rice or corn on the said land, situated in the middle of what appears to be a fast growing residential and business area in the heart of a metropolitan area, is of little moment. Such agricultural activity cannot, by any strained interpretation of law, amount to converting the land in question into agricultural land and subject it to the agrarian reform program of the government. The Supreme Court in Hilario vs. Intermediate Appellate Court (supra) held that:\"x x x. But even if the claim of the private respondent that some corn was planted on the lots is true, this does not convert residential land into agricultural land.The presumption assumed by the appellate court, that a parcel of land which is located in a poblacion is not necessarily devoted to residential purposes, is wrong. It should be the other way around. A lot inside the poblacion should be presumed residential, or commercial or non-agricultural unless there is clearly preponderant evidence to show that it is agricultural.\" (underlining supplied)Clearly, therefore, two (2) requisites \u2014 that the land is agricultural and that the purpose thereof is agricultural production \u2014 necessary to establish the existence of tenancy relationship between Mr. Arroyo and the appellees are absent. On the other requirements for the creation of tenancy relationship, suffice it to reiterate the well-established rule that \"[A]ll these requisites must concur in order to create a tenancy relationship between the parties. The absence of one does not make an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon, a de jure tenant. Unless a person has established his status as a de jure tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by Land Reform Program of the government under existing tenancy laws\" (Prudential Bank v. Gapultos, supra).As appellees are not de jure tenants of Mr. Arroyo, the ineluctable conclusion is that the subject land is outside OLT coverage under PD 27. The issuance, therefore, of CLTs and EPs in favor of the appellees was without legal basis. They must perforce be cancelled. It should be stressed that the recipients of CLT and EP issued pursuant to PD 27 do not necessarily acquire vested rights over the landholding subject thereof. The propriety of canceling a CLT and EP, in case of a finding that the land is outside the coverage of PD 27, is recognized and is in fact provided for in DAR Administrative Order No. 02, s. of 1994 entitled Rules Governing the Correction and Cancellation of Registered/Unregistered Emancipation Patents (EPs), and Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) Due to Unlawful Acts and Omissions or Breach of Obligations of Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) and for Other Causes, which provides that:\"Under Presidential Decree No. 27, Executive Order No. 228, and Republic Act No. 6657, tenants, farmers, and regular farmworkers have the right to own directly the land they till. Ownership shall be evidenced by either an Emancipation Patent (EP) or Certificate of Landownership Award (CLOA)x x x xEPs/CLOAs issued to ARBs may be corrected and cancelled for violations of agrarian laws, rules and regulations. This includes cases of lands which are found to be exempt/excluded from P.D. No. 27/E.O. No. 228 or CARP coverage, or part of the landowner's retained areas. All rights which accrue to the ARB upon cancellation may be forfeited and the amortization they have paid may be refunded.\"WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the assailed DAR orders dated July 19, 1994 and August 7, 1996 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered declaring the 9.8-hectare land in question outside the Operation Land Transfer coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27.[6]Aggrieved by the decision of the Office of the President, petitioners filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, maintaining that the Office of the President erred in finding that the subject landholding has been classified as non-agricultural prior to the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 27 and not primarily devoted to rice or corn crops, and that the farmer-beneficiaries are not tenants of respondent.In a decision dated 11 January 2002, the appellate court denied petitioners' appeal and affirmed the decision of the Office of the President. The Court of Appeals disposed of the issues in this wise:The petition is bereft of merit.x x x xFor Us to determine whether the subject property is within the coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27, We are lifting the pertinent provision of paragraph 5 of P.D. 27 which states in no uncertain terms that:x x x xThis (P.D. 27) shall apply to tenant farmers of private agricultural lands primarily devoted to rice and corn under a system of share-crop or lease tenancy, whether classified as landed or not.\"Thus, from the provision of the above-cited decree, as amended by R.A. 6657, land coverage thereof only applies when two (2) conditions concur, a) the agricultural land is planted with rice and corn; and b) the existence of a tenancy relationship between the landowner and the tenant-farmer.As correctly argued by the respondent herein, and so ruled by the Office of the President, the subject property is not a private agricultural land as specifically required under the aforequoted provision of P.D. 27, as amended. Uncontroverted evidence shows that the subject property had already been classified as residential/commercial even prior to the effectivity of P.D. 27. Per Official Zoning Map of the City of Davao adopted under Resolution No. 711, Ordinance No. 281, s. of 1972 (p. 243, Records), the land was classified as \"Commercial Zone and Residential Zone Class B\". This classification confirmed the residential character of the subject land as appearing in Mr. Arroyo's tax declarations filed way back in 1968 (pp. 187-190, Records). Furthermore, in support of its factual findings, the Office of the President rightfully considered several certifications issued by various government agencies, both local and national, which confirmed the residential character of the property in question, to wit: The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), Davao City, which issued a Zoning Certification to the effect that the subject land is within the Residential/Commercial Zone under the Zoning Ordinance of Davao City adopted through a Sangguniang Bayan Resolution and ratified by the HLURB, through Board Resolution No. 39-4, s. of 1980 dated July 31, 1980 (p. 208, Records).The Office of the Zoning Administrator, City of Davao, certifying to the effect that the subject land is within a Residential Zone Class \"B\" in the Zonification Ordinance of Davao City (p. 126, Records).The Bureau of Soils of then Ministry of Agriculture, Davao City, which submitted a Certification to the effect that the subject land is suitable for urban use/housing projects (p. 127, Records).The Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator, Office of the Zoning Administrator, certifying to the effect that the subject land was classified as Major Commercial Zone (C-2) and High Density Residential Zone (R-2) in the City Ordinance No. 363, s. of 1982 or better known as Expanded Zoning Ordinance of Davao City (p. 160, Records).DAR Provincial Task Force on Illegal Conversion Report dated 02 June 2000, which unequivocably stated that the subject land is no longer agricultural, it being classified as commercial and residential zones. Consequently, said Task Force ruled out any act of illegal conversion.x x x xAs We have already exhaustively discussed above, and in the light of Our findings sustaining the stance of the Office of the President, that the subject property is not classified as an agricultural land, such fact alone is sufficient justification that the petitioners are not de-jure tenants. Apropos thereto, the petitioners are not entitled to the Emancipation Patents issued in their favor. It must perforce be nullified and cancelled.x x x xWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is DENIED. Accordingly, the decision of the Office of the President dated 17 November 2000 in OP Case No. 96-L-6682 is hereby AFFIRMED.[7]Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied, petitioners filed the instant petition before us raising the following assignments of error: That the Court of Appeals has palpably erred in ruling that the parcels of land covered by various Emancipation Patents issued in favor of the Petitioners, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27, were non-agricultural;That the Court of Appeals has palpably erred in basing its determination of the classification of the subject land on its \"actual land classification\" rather than its \"actual use\"; That the Court of Appeals has palpably erred and gravely abused its discretion in not properly and correctly appreciating the acts of Respondent Arroyo \u2014 seeking conversion of the subject landholdings to residential subdivision and in making a Voluntary Offer to Sell the subject parcels of land to the government pursuant to the provision of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) of 1988 \u2014 as admissions of the fact that subject landholdings were indeed agricultural; That the Court of Appeals has palpably and gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the claim of petitioners that they were tenants of the lands covered by the said Emancipation Patents.Preliminarily, respondent, in his Comment, and again reiterated in his Memorandum, argues that the instant petition is defective and must be dismissed for failure to comply with Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court which requires the plaintiff or principal party to make a certification under oath in the initiatory pleading against forum shopping. Respondent maintains that since the signatures of only four of the twelve petitioners appear on the certification against forum shopping attached to the petition, the petition is defective as petitioners have failed to comply with the requirements of the aforementioned Rule and thus warrants the dismissal of the case.While we may agree with respondent's contention that the absence of the signatures of the eight other petitioners in the certification against forum shopping causes the petition to be defective and is therefore a valid cause for the dismissal of the instant petition, this conclusion, however, will not deter this Court from proceeding with the judicial determination of the important legal issues herein. The Court has stressed that the rules on forum shopping were designed to promote and facilitate the orderly administration of justice and thus should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective.[8] The strict compliance with the provisions regarding the certificate of non-forum shopping merely underscores its mandatory nature in that the certification cannot be altogether dispensed with or its requirements completely disregarded.[9] It does not thereby prohibit substantial compliance with provisions under justifiable circumstances.[10] All petitioners as occupants of respondent's land filed the instant petition as a collective group, raising the same arguments to defend their rights. There is sufficient basis, therefore, for the four petitioners to speak for and in behalf of their co-petitioners that they have not filed any action or claim in another court or tribunal involving the same issues.[11] Thus, the execution of the certificate against forum shopping by only four petitioners in behalf of the co-petitioners constitute substantial compliance.[12]Furthermore, we must bear in mind that procedural rules are intended to ensure the proper administration of law and justice. The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense, for they are adopted to help secure, not override, substantial justice.[13] A deviation from its rigid enforcement may thus be allowed to attain its prime objective, for after all, the dispensation of justice is the core reason for the existence of courts.[14] Moreover, we cannot shy away from our constitutionally mandated duty to questions of law set forth in this petition which hinges on the determination of the rights of herein litigants in the light of a very important piece of social legislation, Presidential Decree No. 27, which aims for the equitable distribution and ownership of land, without disregarding the property rights of landowners. Thus, for pragmatic reasons and consideration of justice and equity, the Court must put to rest the issues presented before us.Respondent further contends, and the same is admitted by petitioners, that the settlement of the issues assailed in this petition centers on the review of certain facts which, as a general rule, may not be raised in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. This Court, in numerous instances have had occasion to explain that it is not the function of this Court to analyze or weigh evidence all over again. As a rule, the Court respects the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies like the DAR, giving them a certain measure of finality.[15] However, we have ruled that factual findings of a quasi-judicial institution which are not supported by substantial and credible evidence do not bind this Court, e.g. the findings and conclusions have no basis in the records or are contrary to the evidence on record or the factual determinations of an appellate body are contrary to those of the initial fact-finding agency.[16] Moreover, we have outlined several instances when this Court may resolve factual issues, such as: 1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; 6) when in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; 7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; 8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; 10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; or 11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[17]Records demonstrate that the findings of fact of the DAR, the quasi-judicial agency which first resolved the instant case, differ from that of the Office of the President and the Court of Appeals, the appellate bodies which reviewed such findings. Therefore, based on the exceptions enumerated above, it is clear that due to the disparity between the findings of fact of the DAR on one hand and the Office of the President and the Court of Appeals on the other, the Court may review the facts of this case based on the evidence presented by both parties.Having discussed the preliminary matters, we now endeavor to resolve the crux of this case. As pointed out by the Office of the President, the pivotal issue which must be settled in this petition is whether or not the subject landholding is covered by the Operation Land Transfer under Presidential Decree No. 27. Simply put, we must determine whether or not respondent's property is agricultural land devoted primarily to rice and/or corn and whether or not there is a tenancy relationship between petitioners and respondent.We agree with the petitioners that the date of reckoning as to whether or not the subject property is classified as agricultural is before or at the time of passage of Presidential Decree No. 27 on 21 October 1972 and not after such date. Thus, it is only proper that the Court examine the pieces of evidence that could shed light to the proper classification of the subject property at the time, or at the very least within close proximity in point of time, of the passage of the aforementioned law.To support their stance, petitioners maintain that the landholding has been more than substantially established as agricultural by virtue of a Memorandum dated 17 May 1993 containing the Investigation Report of the DAR personnel who conducted the ocular inspection and investigation showing that the actual use of the land is agricultural being primarily devoted to rice and corn crops.In contrast, respondent offers for consideration several documents to bolster its position that subject land is residential, namely: 1) copies of the Declaration of Real Property (tax declaration) filed by respondent as early as 1968 indicating therein that the subject property is residential;[18] 2) a Certification dated 3 July 1979 by the Bureau of Soils stating that the land is suitable for urban use and for housing projects;[19] 3) a copy of the Preliminary Approval and Locational Clearance granted by the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission dated 12 January 1982 indicating therein that the land is primarily coco land and residential and suitable for the proposed residential subdivision;[20] 4) a Certification from the Office of the Zoning Administrator of Davao City dated 10 December 1981 to the effect that the property per Zonification Ordinance of Davao City is within a Residential Zone Class \"B\";[21] 5) a Zoning Certification issued by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) dated 4 March 1991 certifying that the land is within the Residential/Commercial Zones under zoning ordinance of Davao City adopted through a Sangguniang Bayan Resolution and ratified by the HLURB, through Board Resolution No. 39-4, s. of 1980, dated 31 July 1980;[22] 6) a Certification from the Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator, Office of the Zoning Administrator, dated 26 March 1991 to the effect that the subject land was classified as Major Commercial Zone (C-2) and High Density Residential Zone (R-2) in the City Ordinance No. 363, s. of 1982, or better known as Expanded Zoning Ordinance of Davao City;[23] 7) a Certification from the Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator of Davao City dated 16 February 1996 that per Official Zoning Map of the City of Davao adopted under Resolution No. 711, Ordinance No. 281, Series of 1972, the subject property is within two zones classification namely: Commercial Zone and Residential Zone Class B;[24] and 8) the Report of the DAR Provincial Task Force on Illegal Conversion dated 2 June 2000, ruling out any act of illegal conversion as the subject land is classified as commercial and residential zones.Although this Court will not disregard the evidence presented by petitioners that the land is devoted to rice and corn crops in 1993, when the ocular inspection by the DAR personnel was conducted, it must be noted that around the time of the passage of Presidential Decree No. 27 up to 1978, when the subject property was placed under the coverage of Operation Land Transfer, the available evidence issued and certified by the different government agencies, closer in time to the mentioned time frame will show that respondent's property has, indeed, been classified as within the residential and commercial zones of Davao City. It cannot escape the notice of this Court that more than a decade before the issuance of the said ocular investigation report stating that the land is devoted to agricultural production, government agencies equipped with the technical expertise to determine the proper classification of the subject land have already determined that the land is part of the residential and commercial zones of Davao City making it suitable for other urban use. Therefore, it is only reasonable to conclude, based on the certification of various executive agencies issued when this controversy arose, that at the time of the passage of Presidential Decree No. 27, respondent's property was not agricultural.Well settled is the principle that by reason of the special knowledge and expertise of administrative agencies over matters falling under their jurisdiction, they are in a better position to pass judgment thereon; thus their findings of fact in that regard are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the courts.[25] Accordingly, since specialized government agencies tasked to determine the classification of parcels of land, such as the Bureau of Soils and the HLURB, among other agencies, have already certified that the subject land is residential/commercial, the Court must accord such conclusions great respect, if not finality, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.Based on the foregoing, we thus conclude that at the time of the passage of Presidential Decree No. 27, the subject land consisting of 9.8038 hectares was not agricultural.As to the issue of whether or not there exists a tenancy relationship between petitioners and respondents, we sustain the findings of both the Court of Appeals and the Office of the President that petitioners are not de jure tenants of respondent.The case of Caballes v. Department of Agrarian Reform[26] outlines the essential requisites of a tenancy relationship which must all concur in order to create a tenancy relationship between parties, to wit:1. The parties are the landowner and the tenant;2. The subject is agricultural land;3. There is consent;4. The purpose is agricultural production;5. There is personal cultivation; and6. There is sharing of harvests.The absence of one does not make an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon, a de jure tenant.[27] This is so because unless a person has established his status as a de jure tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by the Land Reform Program of the Government under existing tenancy laws.[28] The subject land not being agricultural, the requirements for the creation of a tenancy relationship is thus lacking. Moreover, the Court has had the occasion to state that the key factor in ascertaining whether or not there is a landowner-tenant relationship in this case is the nature of the disputed property.[29] Accordingly, having earlier concluded that the subject landholding is not agricultural, we must conclude that petitioners are not de jure tenants of respondent and are, therefore, not entitled to the benefits of Presidential Decree No. 27.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DENIED.

REPRESENTED BY SERGIA ESTANTE, PETITIONERS, VS. ANTONIO L. ARROYO, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nBefore Us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure assailing the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the Decision [2] of the Office of the President reversing the Order [3] of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) which dismissed herein respondent's appeal from the order dated 19 May 1989 of the Regional Director of DAR Region XI dismissing the petition filed by Antonio Arroyo for the cancellation of Certificates of Land Transfer (CLTs) issued to herein petitioners.\n\nOn 23 November 1978, respondent Arroyo received a letter from the legal officer of the then Ministry of Agrarian Reform (now DAR) informing him that his land with an aggregate area of 9.8038 hectares situated at Matina, Davao City, was the subject of Operation Land Transfer (OLT) under Presidential Decree No. 27, which took effect on 21 October 1972.\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise, he was advised that he could apply for the conversion of the land to residential or other urban purposes in accordance with applicable laws.\u00a0 In a letter dated 16 January 1979, then Team Leader I of the Ministry of Agrarian Reform notified respondent that based on the parcellary map sketching conducted by the Agrarian Reform and the Bureau of Lands, the subject property was covered by the OLT program since the area thereof, which was tenanted at that time, was more than seven hectares.\n\nBased on an Indorsement issued by the City Zoning and Development Officer on 5 July 1979 certifying that the property is \"partly zonified as Residential Class \"A\" and \"B,\" Commercial and Open Space x x x as per existing Zoning Ordinance of Davao City,\" respondent applied for the conversion of the land to residential subdivision on 24 July 1979.\u00a0 Attached to the said application were documents issued by different government agencies such as the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission (precursor of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board [HLURB]), Bureau of Soils and the City of Davao, showing that said land has been classified as residential.\n\nActing on said application, DAR local officials conducted a series of conferences between respondent, through his representative, and herein petitioners as occupants of the property, purposely to reach a settlement for the latter's relocation, award of respective homelots, and the payment of disturbance compensation as a consequence of the conversion.\u00a0 However, no final agreement was reached between the parties.\u00a0 This prompted the Agrarian Reform Technologist of Davao City to propose that the tenants on the land be accorded the benefits of Presidential Decree No. 27 or that the matter be referred to the Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance for proper action.\n\nWithout first resolving respondent's application for conversion, the then Ministry of Agrarian Reform issued in November 1984 the questioned CLTs in favor of petitioners.\u00a0 Upon knowledge of said issuance, respondent filed a petition for the cancellation of said CLTs on 27 August 1985 on the ground that the subject land was, and still is, residential property and thus, beyond the coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27.\u00a0 Furthermore, respondent denies the existence of a tenancy relationship between him and petitioners.\n\nOn 8 August 1988, respondent, through his attorney-in-fact, made a Voluntary Offer to Sell his entire landholding, including the subject property, to the government in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988.\u00a0 As a consequence thereof, the Regional Director of DAR Region XI issued an Order dated 19 May 1989 dismissing respondent's petition for cancellation of CLTs.\u00a0 According to said Order, \"with the offer made by petitioner, the issue in this petition, whether or not the subject properties are within the land transfer coverage, becomes moot and academic.\" [4] Respondent appealed said Order to the Office of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform praying that it be set aside and that the CLTs be cancelled.\u00a0 Meanwhile, in 1990, the DAR issued Emancipation Patents to petitioners as the identified farmer-beneficiaries on the land.\n\nIn an Order dated 19 July 1994, then DAR Secretary Ernesto Garilao dismissed respondent's appeal and upheld the validity of the Emancipation Patents awarded to petitioners.\u00a0 According to the Secretary:\nGoing to the first issue, this Office so holds that the landholding in question are agricultural as of October 21, 1972 despite the fact that the same have been declared for tax purposes as residential.\u00a0 The Memorandum dated May 17, 1993 which contains the investigation report of the DAR personnel who conducted the ocular inspection and investigation explicitly shows that when Presidential Decree No. 27 took effect the actual use of the land is agricultural.\u00a0 This fact is further buttressed when petitioner, in his letter dated August 8, 1988 manifested his desire to voluntarily offer to sell the properties in question to the Department of Agrarian Reform, declaring that the subject landholdings are productive and suitable to agricultural production.\n\nThe fact that there is a certification from the HLURB that the property has been rezoned to residential use is of no moment.\u00a0 It must be observed that the notion that real property which is already classified as residential or commercial, is no longer agricultural land, is found in Section 3 of R.A. 6657.\u00a0 In other words, the property was still agricultural at the time of the promulgation of P.D. 27, and the rights of the tenant farmers shall have vested by then, and future reclassification could not derogate such vested rights.\n\nAnent the second issue, records show that sharing was established as per receipts submitted during the investigation by Primitivo J. Borres, overseer of the subject landholding.\u00a0 Records further disclosed that the agricultural produce were received by Melencio A. Gumtang and Bonifacio P. Bernardino, administrators of Antonio Arroyo's properties in Matina, Davao City.\u00a0 The contention of the petitioner that there was no consent extended by him to the respondents is not well-taken.\u00a0 As borne out by the records, overseer Primitivo J. Borres permitted the tilling of the land by the respondents hence, the landowner-petitioner in the present case is chargeable with knowledge through his overseer of such cultivation.\u00a0 Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, tenancy relationship may be established either verbally or in writing, expressly or impliedly.\n\nx x x x\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, Order is hereby issued dismissing the instant petition for utter lack of merit.\u00a0 The validity of the issuance of the Emancipation Patents (EPs) to the tenants is hereby affirmed. [5]\nRespondent's Motion for Reconsideration was subsequently denied in an Order dated 7 August 1996, prompting respondent to file an appeal before the Office of the President. In a Decision dated 17 November 2000, the Office of the President reversed the order of the DAR Secretary and declared the 9.8 hectares outside the coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27, to wit:\nThe crux of this case is whether or not grounds exist to warrant the cancellation of CLTs and EPs issued to appellees as the identified tenant-beneficiaries on the land.\u00a0 The determination of this issue in turn hinges on the question of whether or not the subject land is exempt under OLT coverage of PD 27.\n\nIn the recent case of Eudosia Daez vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 133507, February 17, 2000, the Supreme Court set forth the requirements for coverage under the OLT program in this wise:\n\"PD 27, which implemented the Operation Land Transfer (OLT) Program, covers tenanted rice or corn lands.\u00a0 The requisites for coverage under the OLT Program are the following: (1) the land must be devoted to rice or corn crops; and (2) there must be a system of share-crop or lease tenancy obtaining therein.\u00a0 If either requisite is absent, a landowner may apply for exemption.\u00a0 If either for [sic] those requisites is absent, the land is not covered under OLT.\nx x x x\n\nThus, on one hand, exemption from coverage of OLT lies if: (1) the land is not devoted to rice or corn crops even if it is tenanted; or (2) the land is untenanted even though it is devoted to rice or corn crops.\"\nGuided by the foregoing, it is essential to determine whether or not tenancy relationship exists between Mr. Arroyo and the appellees.\u00a0 In the absence of the all important element of tenancy, the subject land falls outside OLT coverage of PD 27 even if incidentally it is devoted to rice and/or corn.\u00a0 In the case of Prudential Bank vs. Gapultos, 181 SCRA 160 [1990], the Supreme Court lists the requisites essential for the establishment of tenancy relationship, thus:\n\"The essential requisites of tenancy relationship are: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject is agricultural land; (3) there is consent; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation; and (6) there is sharing of harvests.\u00a0 All these requisites must concur in order to create a tenancy relationship between the parties.\u00a0 The absence of one does not make an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon, a de jure tenant.\u00a0 Unless a person has established his status as a de jure tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by Land Reform Program of the government under existing tenancy laws.\"\nx x x x\nApplying the above-stated requirements in the case at bar, we find the absence of tenancy relationship between the parties. Firstly, subject land is not an agricultural land, as the term is understood. Uncontroverted evidence shows that the subject land had been classified as residential/commercial even prior to the effectivity of PD 27.\u00a0 Per Official Zoning Map of the City of Davao adopted under Resolution No. 711, Ordinance No. 281, s. of 1972 (p. 243, Records), the land was classified as \"Commercial Zone and Residential Zone Class B\". This classification confirmed the residential character of the subject land as appearing in Mr. Arroyo's tax declarations filed way back in 1968 (pp. 187-190, Records). x x x\nThe residential character of the subject property is likewise confirmed by the following government agencies or offices:\n1. The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), Davao City, which issued a Zoning Certification to the effect that the subject land is within the Residential/Commercial Zone under the Zoning Ordinance of Davao City adopted through a Sangguniang Bayan Resolution and ratified by the HLURB, through Board Resolution No. 39-4, s. of 1980 dated July 31, 1980 (p. 208, Records).\n\n2. The Office of the Zoning Administrator, City of Davao, certifying to the effect that the subject land is within a Residential Zone Class \"B\" in the Zonification Ordinance of Davao City (p. 126, Records).\n\n3. The Bureau of Soils of then Ministry of Agriculture, Davao City, which submitted a Certification to the effect that the subject land is suitable for urban use/housing projects (p. 127, Records).\n\n4. The Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator, Office of the Zoning Administrator, certifying to the effect that the subject land was classified as Major Commercial Zone (C-2) and High Density Residential Zone (R-2) in the City Ordinance No. 363, s. of 1982 or better known as Expanded Zoning Ordinance of Davao City (p. 160, Records).To cap it all, even the DAR Provincial Task Force on Illegal Conversion, after conducting on April 10, 2000 an investigation on the reported illegal conversion of the subject land, admitted on its report of June 2, 2000 that it is no longer agricultural, it being classified as commercial and residential zones. Consequently, they ruled out any act of illegal conversion. Secondly, the records show that the land in dispute was never intended for agricultural production. For one, no agricultural improvements were introduced upon the land since its acquisition by Mr. Arroyo in 1951. In fact, for more than a decade since 1972, the disputed land was subject of numerous business proposals (attached to Appeal/Memorandum) from various land developers for purposes of developing it into a residential and commercial area. For another, the subject property is situated in a commercial and residential area. As the records show, it is adjacent to the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) subdivision and other residential or commercial establishments, and surrounded by GSIS Heights, Villa Josefina Subdivision, Flores Village, Central Park Subdivision, Poly Subdivision, San Miguel Village, New Matina Golf Club, Davao Memorial Park, Shrine of the Infant Jesus, Matina Public Market and Venees hotel.\nThe fact that appellees may perhaps have planted rice or corn on the said land, situated in the middle of what appears to be a fast growing residential and business area in the heart of a metropolitan area, is of little moment. Such agricultural activity cannot, by any strained interpretation of law, amount to converting the land in question into agricultural land and subject it to the agrarian reform program of the government. The Supreme Court in Hilario vs. Intermediate Appellate Court (supra) held that:\n\"x x x. But even if the claim of the private respondent that some corn was planted on the lots is true, this does not convert residential land into agricultural land.\n\nThe presumption assumed by the appellate court, that a parcel of land which is located in a poblacion is not necessarily devoted to residential purposes, is wrong. It should be the other way around. A lot inside the poblacion should be presumed residential, or commercial or non-agricultural unless there is clearly preponderant evidence to show that it is agricultural.\" (underlining supplied)\nClearly, therefore, two (2) requisites \u2014 that the land is agricultural and that the purpose thereof is agricultural production \u2014 necessary to establish the existence of tenancy relationship between Mr. Arroyo and the appellees are absent. On the other requirements for the creation of tenancy relationship, suffice it to reiterate the well-established rule that \"[A]ll these requisites must concur in order to create a tenancy relationship between the parties. The absence of one does not make an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon, a de jure tenant. Unless a person has established his status as a de jure tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by Land Reform Program of the government under existing tenancy laws\" (Prudential Bank v. Gapultos, supra).\nAs appellees are not de jure tenants of Mr. Arroyo, the ineluctable conclusion is that the subject land is outside OLT coverage under PD 27. The issuance, therefore, of CLTs and EPs in favor of the appellees was without legal basis. They must perforce be cancelled. It should be stressed that the recipients of CLT and EP issued pursuant to PD 27 do not necessarily acquire vested rights over the landholding subject thereof. The propriety of canceling a CLT and EP, in case of a finding that the land is outside the coverage of PD 27, is recognized and is in fact provided for in DAR Administrative Order No. 02, s. of 1994 entitled Rules Governing the Correction and Cancellation of Registered/Unregistered Emancipation Patents (EPs), and Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) Due to Unlawful Acts and Omissions or Breach of Obligations of Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) and for Other Causes, which provides that:\n\"Under Presidential Decree No. 27, Executive Order No. 228, and Republic Act No. 6657, tenants, farmers, and regular farmworkers have the right to own directly the land they till. Ownership shall be evidenced by either an Emancipation Patent (EP) or Certificate of Landownership Award (CLOA)\nx x x x\nEPs/CLOAs issued to ARBs may be corrected and cancelled for violations of agrarian laws, rules and regulations. This includes cases of lands which are found to be exempt/excluded from P.D. No. 27/E.O. No. 228 or CARP coverage, or part of the landowner's retained areas. All rights which accrue to the ARB upon cancellation may be forfeited and the amortization they have paid may be refunded.\"\n\nWHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the assailed DAR orders dated July 19, 1994 and August 7, 1996 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered declaring the 9.8-hectare land in question outside the Operation Land Transfer coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27. [6]\nAggrieved by the decision of the Office of the President, petitioners filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, maintaining that the Office of the President erred in finding that the subject landholding has been classified as non-agricultural prior to the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 27 and not primarily devoted to rice or corn crops, and that the farmer-beneficiaries are not tenants of respondent.\n\nIn a decision dated 11 January 2002, the appellate court denied petitioners' appeal and affirmed the decision of the Office of the President. The Court of Appeals disposed of the issues in this wise:\nThe petition is bereft of merit.\n\nx x x x\n\nFor Us to determine whether the subject property is within the coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27, We are lifting the pertinent provision of paragraph 5 of P.D. 27 which states in no uncertain terms that:\nx x x x\n\nThis (P.D. 27) shall apply to tenant farmers of private agricultural lands primarily devoted to rice and corn under a system of share-crop or lease tenancy, whether classified as landed or not.\" Thus, from the provision of the above-cited decree, as amended by R.A. 6657, land coverage thereof only applies when two (2) conditions concur, a) the agricultural land is planted with rice and corn; and b) the existence of a tenancy relationship between the landowner and the tenant-farmer.\nAs correctly argued by the respondent herein, and so ruled by the Office of the President, the subject property is not a private agricultural land as specifically required under the aforequoted provision of P.D. 27, as amended.\u00a0 Uncontroverted evidence shows that the subject property had already been classified as residential/commercial even prior to the effectivity of P.D. 27.\u00a0 Per Official Zoning Map of the City of Davao adopted under Resolution No. 711, Ordinance No. 281, s. of 1972 (p. 243, Records), the land was classified as \"Commercial Zone and Residential Zone Class B\".\u00a0 This classification confirmed the residential character of the subject land as appearing in Mr. Arroyo's tax declarations filed way back in 1968 (pp. 187-190, Records).\u00a0 Furthermore, in support of its factual findings, the Office of the President rightfully considered several certifications issued by various government agencies, both local and national, which confirmed the residential character of the property in question, to wit:\nThe Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), Davao City, which issued a Zoning Certification to the effect that the subject land is within the Residential/Commercial Zone under the Zoning Ordinance of Davao City adopted through a Sangguniang Bayan Resolution and ratified by the HLURB, through Board Resolution No. 39-4, s. of 1980 dated July 31, 1980 (p. 208, Records).\n\nThe Office of the Zoning Administrator, City of Davao, certifying to the effect that the subject land is within a Residential Zone Class \"B\" in the Zonification Ordinance of Davao City (p. 126, Records).\n\nThe Bureau of Soils of then Ministry of Agriculture, Davao City, which submitted a Certification to the effect that the subject land is suitable for urban use/housing projects (p. 127, Records).\n\nThe Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator, Office of the Zoning Administrator, certifying to the effect that the subject land was classified as Major Commercial Zone (C-2) and High Density Residential Zone (R-2) in the City Ordinance No. 363, s. of 1982 or better known as Expanded Zoning Ordinance of Davao City (p. 160, Records).\n\nDAR Provincial Task Force on Illegal Conversion Report dated 02 June 2000, which unequivocably stated that the subject land is no longer agricultural, it being classified as commercial and residential zones.\u00a0 Consequently, said Task Force ruled out any act of illegal conversion. <BLOCKQUOTE x x x x\nAs We have already exhaustively discussed above, and in the light of Our findings sustaining the stance of the Office of the President, that the subject property is not classified as an agricultural land, such fact alone is sufficient justification that the petitioners are not de-jure tenants.\u00a0 Apropos thereto, the petitioners are not entitled to the Emancipation Patents issued in their favor.\u00a0 It must perforce be nullified and cancelled.\nx x x x\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is DENIED.\u00a0 Accordingly, the decision of the Office of the President dated 17 November 2000 in OP Case No. 96-L-6682 is hereby AFFIRMED. [7]\nPetitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied, petitioners filed the instant petition before us raising the following assignments of error:\nThat the Court of Appeals has palpably erred in ruling that the parcels of land covered by various Emancipation Patents issued in favor of the Petitioners, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27, were non-agricultural;\n\nThat the Court of Appeals has palpably erred in basing its determination of the classification of the subject land on its \"actual land classification\" rather than its \"actual use\";\n\nThat the Court of Appeals has palpably erred and gravely abused its discretion in not properly and correctly appreciating the acts of Respondent Arroyo \u2014 seeking conversion of the subject landholdings to residential subdivision and in making a Voluntary Offer to Sell the subject parcels of land to the government pursuant to the provision of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) of 1988 \u2014 as admissions of the fact that subject landholdings were indeed agricultural;\n\nThat the Court of Appeals has palpably and gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the claim of petitioners that they were tenants of the lands covered by the said Emancipation Patents. Preliminarily, respondent, in his Comment, and again reiterated in his Memorandum, argues that the instant petition is defective and must be dismissed for failure to comply with Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court which requires the plaintiff or principal party to make a certification under oath in the initiatory pleading against forum shopping.\u00a0 Respondent maintains that since the signatures of only four of the twelve petitioners appear on the certification against forum shopping attached to the petition, the petition is defective as petitioners have failed to comply with the requirements of the aforementioned Rule and thus warrants the dismissal of the case.\n\nWhile we may agree with respondent's contention that the absence of the signatures of the eight other petitioners in the certification against forum shopping causes the petition to be defective and is therefore a valid cause for the dismissal of the instant petition, this conclusion, however, will not deter this Court from proceeding with the judicial determination of the important legal issues herein.\u00a0 The Court has stressed that the rules on forum shopping were designed to promote and facilitate the orderly administration of justice and thus should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective. [8] The strict compliance with the provisions regarding the certificate of non-forum shopping merely underscores its mandatory nature in that the certification cannot be altogether dispensed with or its requirements completely disregarded. [9] It does not thereby prohibit substantial compliance with provisions under justifiable circumstances. [10] All petitioners as occupants of respondent's land filed the instant petition as a collective group, raising the same arguments to defend their rights.\u00a0 There is sufficient basis, therefore, for the four petitioners to speak for and in behalf of their co-petitioners that they have not filed any action or claim in another court or tribunal involving the same issues. [11] Thus, the execution of the certificate against forum shopping by only four petitioners in behalf of the co-petitioners constitute substantial compliance. [12]\n\nFurthermore, we must bear in mind that procedural rules are intended to ensure the proper administration of law and justice.\u00a0 The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense, for they are adopted to help secure, not override, substantial justice. [13] A deviation from its rigid enforcement may thus be allowed to attain its prime objective, for after all, the dispensation of justice is the core reason for the existence of courts. [14] Moreover, we cannot shy away from our constitutionally mandated duty to questions of law set forth in this petition which hinges on the determination of the rights of herein litigants in the light of a very important piece of social legislation, Presidential Decree No. 27, which aims for the equitable distribution and ownership of land, without disregarding the property rights of landowners.\u00a0 Thus, for pragmatic reasons and consideration of justice and equity, the Court must put to rest the issues presented before us.\n\nRespondent further contends, and the same is admitted by petitioners, that the settlement of the issues assailed in this petition centers on the review of certain facts which, as a general rule, may not be raised in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\u00a0 This Court, in numerous instances have had occasion to explain that it is not the function of this Court to analyze or weigh evidence all over again.\u00a0 As a rule, the Court respects the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies like the DAR, giving them a certain measure of finality. [15] However, we have ruled that factual findings of a quasi-judicial institution which are not supported by substantial and credible evidence do not bind this Court, e.g. the findings and conclusions have no basis in the records or are contrary to the evidence on record or the factual determinations of an appellate body are contrary to those of the initial fact-finding agency. [16] Moreover, we have outlined several instances when this Court may resolve factual issues, such as: 1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; 6) when in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; 7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; 8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; 10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; or 11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. [17]\n\nRecords demonstrate that the findings of fact of the DAR, the quasi-judicial agency which first resolved the instant case, differ from that of the Office of the President and the Court of Appeals, the appellate bodies which reviewed such findings.\u00a0 Therefore, based on the exceptions enumerated above, it is clear that due to the disparity between the findings of fact of the DAR on one hand and the Office of the President and the Court of Appeals on the other, the Court may review the facts of this case based on the evidence presented by both parties.\n\nHaving discussed the preliminary matters, we now endeavor to resolve the crux of this case.\u00a0 As pointed out by the Office of the President, the pivotal issue which must be settled in this petition is whether or not the subject landholding is covered by the Operation Land Transfer under Presidential Decree No. 27.\u00a0 Simply put, we must determine whether or not respondent's property is agricultural land devoted primarily to rice and/or corn and whether or not there is a tenancy relationship between petitioners and respondent.\n\nWe agree with the petitioners that the date of reckoning as to whether or not the subject property is classified as agricultural is before or at the time of passage of Presidential Decree No. 27 on 21 October 1972 and not after such date.\u00a0 Thus, it is only proper that the Court examine the pieces of evidence that could shed light to the proper classification of the subject property at the time, or at the very least within close proximity in point of time, of the passage of the aforementioned law.\n\nTo support their stance, petitioners maintain that the landholding has been more than substantially established as agricultural by virtue of a Memorandum dated 17 May 1993 containing the Investigation Report of the DAR personnel who conducted the ocular inspection and investigation showing that the actual use of the land is agricultural being primarily devoted to rice and corn crops.\n\nIn contrast, respondent offers for consideration several documents to bolster its position that subject land is residential, namely: 1) copies of the Declaration of Real Property (tax declaration) filed by respondent as early as 1968 indicating therein that the subject property is residential; [18] 2) a Certification dated 3 July 1979 by the Bureau of Soils stating that the land is suitable for urban use and for housing projects; [19] 3) a copy of the Preliminary Approval and Locational Clearance granted by the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission dated 12 January 1982 indicating therein that the land is primarily coco land and residential and suitable for the proposed residential subdivision; [20] 4) a Certification from the Office of the Zoning Administrator of\u00a0 Davao City dated 10 December 1981 to the effect that the property per Zonification Ordinance of Davao City is within a Residential Zone Class \"B\"; [21] 5) a Zoning Certification issued by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) dated 4 March 1991 certifying that the land is within the Residential/Commercial\u00a0 Zones under zoning ordinance of Davao City adopted through a Sangguniang Bayan Resolution and ratified by the HLURB, through Board Resolution No. 39-4, s. of 1980, dated 31 July 1980; [22] 6) a Certification from the Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator, Office of the Zoning Administrator, dated 26 March 1991 to the effect that the subject land was classified as Major Commercial Zone (C-2) and High Density Residential Zone (R-2) in the City Ordinance No. 363, s. of 1982, or better known as Expanded Zoning Ordinance of Davao City; [23] 7) a Certification from the Office of the City Planning and Development Coordinator of Davao City dated 16 February 1996 that per Official Zoning Map of the City of Davao adopted under Resolution No. 711, Ordinance No. 281, Series of 1972, the subject property is within two zones classification namely: Commercial Zone and Residential Zone Class B; [24] and 8) the Report of the DAR Provincial Task Force on Illegal Conversion dated 2 June 2000, ruling out any act of illegal conversion as the subject land is classified as commercial and residential zones.\n\nAlthough this Court will not disregard the evidence presented by petitioners that the land is devoted to rice and corn crops in 1993, when the ocular inspection by the DAR personnel was conducted, it must be noted that around the time of the passage of Presidential Decree No. 27 up to 1978, when the subject property was placed under the coverage of Operation Land Transfer, the available evidence issued and certified by the different government agencies, closer in time to the mentioned time frame will show that respondent's property has, indeed, been classified as within the residential and commercial zones of Davao City.\u00a0 It cannot escape the notice of this Court that more than a decade before the issuance of the said ocular investigation report stating that the land is devoted to agricultural production, government agencies equipped with the technical expertise to determine the proper classification of the subject land have already determined that the land is part of the residential and commercial zones of Davao City making it suitable for other urban use.\u00a0 Therefore, it is only reasonable to conclude, based on the certification of various executive agencies issued when this controversy arose, that at the time of the passage of Presidential Decree No. 27, respondent's property was not agricultural.\n\nWell settled is the principle that by reason of the special knowledge and expertise of administrative agencies over matters falling under their jurisdiction, they are in a better position to pass judgment thereon; thus their findings of fact in that regard are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the courts. [25] Accordingly, since specialized government agencies tasked to determine the classification of parcels of land, such as the Bureau of Soils and the HLURB, among other agencies, have already certified that the subject land is residential/commercial, the Court must accord such conclusions great respect, if not finality, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we thus conclude that at the time of the passage of Presidential Decree No. 27, the subject land consisting of 9.8038 hectares was not agricultural.\n\nAs to the issue of whether or not there exists a tenancy relationship between petitioners and respondents, we sustain the findings of both the Court of Appeals and the Office of the President that petitioners are not de jure tenants of respondent.\n\nThe case of Caballes v. Department of Agrarian Reform [26] outlines the essential requisites of a tenancy relationship which must all concur in order to create a tenancy relationship between parties, to wit:\n\n1. The parties are the landowner and the tenant;\n2. The subject is agricultural land;\n3. There is consent;\n4. The purpose is agricultural production;\n5. There is personal cultivation; and\n6. There is sharing of harvests.\n\nThe absence of one does not make an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon, a de jure tenant. [27] This is so because unless a person has established his status as a de jure tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by the Land Reform Program of the Government under existing tenancy laws. [28] The subject land not being agricultural, the requirements for the creation of a tenancy relationship is thus lacking.\u00a0 Moreover, the Court has had the occasion to state that the key factor in ascertaining whether or not there is a landowner-tenant relationship in this case is the nature of the disputed property. [29] Accordingly, having earlier concluded that the subject landholding is not agricultural, we must conclude that petitioners are not de jure tenants of respondent and are, therefore, not entitled to the benefits of Presidential Decree No. 27.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DENIED.\u00a0 The Decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED.

Acting on the complaint, Regional Director Bartolome Amoguis issued an inspection authority to Senior Labor Enforcement Officer Napoleon Santos.\n\nOn 22 August 1997, an inspection was conducted on the premises of petitioner's offices wherein the following violations of labor standards law were discovered, to wit: nonpresentation of employment records (payrolls and daily time records); underpayment of wages, regular holiday pay, and overtime pay; and nonpayment of 13th month pay and service incentive leave pay. On the same day, the Notice of Inspection Result was received by and explained to the manager of petitioner corporation Mr. Jae Kwan Lee, with the corresponding directive that necessary restitution be effected within five days from said receipt.\n\nAs no restitution was made, the Regional Office thereafter conducted summary investigations. However, despite due notice, petitioner failed to appear for two consecutive scheduled hearings. Furthermore, petitioner failed to question the findings of the Labor Inspector received by and explained to the corporation's manager.\n\nThus, on 6 November 1997, Regional Director Amoguis issued the assailed Order, the decretal portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, respondents EJR CRAFTS CORPORATION and/or MR. SASIGWANI DAVE and MR. JAE KUAN LEE is hereby ordered to pay JEAN ARO, ET AL., the total amount of ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO PESOS and 80/100 (P1,382,332.80) corresponding to their claims within ten (10) days from receipt hereof, otherwise, a WRIT OF EXECUTION shall be issued. [5] Petitioner then filed a Motion for Reconsideration of said Order on 21 November 1997 arguing that the Regional Director has no jurisdiction over the case as private respondents were allegedly no longer connected with petitioner corporation at the time of the filing of the complaint and when the inspection was conducted, and that private respondents' claims are within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters. Petitioner further contends that it was never served with the notices of the hearings nor was it notified of the inspection results, thus denying it of due process.\n\nIn the 14 May 1998 Order of the Labor Secretary Cresenciano B. Trajano, petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was treated as an appeal and petitioner was directed to file an appeal bond equivalent to the amount adjudged in the assailed Order within 10 calendar days from receipt of the order; otherwise, the appeal will be dismissed for not having been perfected. On 3 June 1998, petitioner filed a supplemental motion for reconsideration and a motion for reduction of bond. Thereafter, petitioner filed a manifestation and motion praying that the surety bond in the amount of P100,000.00 be approved as compliance with the order of Secretary Trajano. In an order dated 10 July 1998, Undersecretary Jose M. Espa\u00f1ol, Jr. denied the motion for reduction of bond for lack of merit, and petitioner was ordered to post a cash or surety bond in the amount of P1,382,332.80, which petitioner complied with on 31 July 1998 by filing a surety bond in the amount ordered.\n\nOn 24 November 1998, Undersecretary Espa\u00f1ol issued the assailed Resolution affirming the Order of the Regional Director with modification that Mr. Dave Sasigwani and Mr. Jae Kwan Lee are not personally liable. The Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioner was subsequently denied for lack of merit.\n\nUpon receipt of the Resolution denying its motion for reconsideration, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the Court of Appeals. Said petition was thereafter dismissed in the Decision dated 20 July 2001. According to the appellate court:\nThe pivotal issue in this case is whether the Regional Director has jurisdiction over the claims of herein private respondents.\n\nWe find in favor of the private respondents.\n\nIt is admitted that for the Regional Director to exercise the power to order compliance, or the so-called \"enforcement power\" under Article 128(b) of P.D. No. 442 as amended, it is necessary that the employer-employee relationship still exists.\n\nIn support of its contention that it is the Labor Arbiter and not the Regional Director who has jurisdiction over the claims of herein private respondents, petitioner contends that at the time the complaint was filed, the private respondents were no longer its employees. However, aside from photocopies of documents entitled \"Release and Quitclaim,\" no other evidence was adduced by the petitioner to substantiate this claim. These documents, being mere photocopies are unreliable and incompetent without the original and deserves little credence or weight.\n\nMoreover, when compared to other documents in the records of this case, the entries in said \"Release and Quitclaim\" raise serious doubts as to the authenticity and veracity of such photocopies. Upon perusal of such \"Release and Quitclaim\", We find that the entries therein do not correspond with the declarations of the private respondents in the Questionnaires/Affidavits which they filled up and submitted to the DOLE.\n\nx x x x\n\nAs is well-settled, if doubts exist between the evidence presented by the employer and the employee, the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the employee. Since it is a time-honored rule that in controversies between a laborer and his master, doubts reasonably arising from the evidence, or in the interpretation of agreements and writings should be resolved in the former's favor ( Prangan vs. NLRC, 289 SCRA 142 ).\n\nx x x x\n\nLeft with no other evidence of its allegation, petitioner's denial becomes a negative and self-serving evidence which has no weight in law. Accordingly, the allegation of lack of jurisdiction necessarily fails.\n\nx x x x\n\nPetitioner's allegation that it was denied due process is not well taken.\n\nA perusal of the records, particularly the Notice of Inspection Result, reveals that petitioner, through its manager Mr. Jae Kwan Lee, was served a copy of the result of the inspection and that the same was explained to him. The said notice of inspection result advised petitioner to submit within five (5) working days to the Regional Office its questions or objections to the findings of the Labor Enforcement Officer, otherwise an order of compliance shall be issued. However, instead of submitting its objections or question such findings, petitioner chose to remain silent even after it was notified of the hearings to be conducted on said case. It is only after an order was issued by the Regional Director directing the petitioner to pay a substantial amount that it began to assert its right. Clearly, there was no denial of due process.\n\nFurthermore, petitioner was given another chance to present its case when it filed a motion for reconsideration which the DOLE considered an appeal.\n\nFinally, the Undersecretary of Labor correctly affirmed the Order of the Regional Director since the assailed Order was not without basis.\n\nSaid order of Regional Director Amoguis was based on the uncontested result of the inspection, on the Questionnaires/Affidavits of the private respondents, and on the applicable provision of the Labor Code. Moreover, petitioner failed to prove its case during the appeal since it did not adduce evidence sufficient to warrant reversal of the assailed Order of Regional Director.\n\nAccordingly, We find the assailed resolutions to be in harmony with the evidence on record and existing law and jurisprudence.\n\nWHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED. [6] Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was subsequently denied in a Resolution dated 28 June 2002.\n\nHence, the instant petition seeking the resolution of the following issues:\nWhether or not public respondent Regional Director has jurisdiction over the case;\n\nWhether or not public respondents had committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the appeal and/or motion for reconsideration and the subsequent petition for certiorari of the petitioner;\n\nWhether or not the public respondents had denied to the petitioner its right to due process of law;\n\nWhether or not, in the possibility that public respondent Regional Director has jurisdiction over the case, his decision was a faithful application of the law and correct appreciation of the evidence on record. Petitioner maintains that the Regional Director has no jurisdiction over the instant case since private respondents have ceased to be connected with the petitioner at the time of the filing of the complaint as well as when the inspection/investigation was conducted by the Labor Enforcement Officer. According to petitioner, this fact is supported by the Quitclaim and Release forms submitted by petitioner and attached as annexes to the petition for certiorari filed before the Court of Appeals, as it is clearly stated therein that private respondents had already finished their contract with petitioner. Thus, petitioner contends that there being no employer-employee relationship between private respondents and petitioner, the claims of the private respondents for payment of monetary benefits fall within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter.\n\nIt is further argued by petitioner that it was denied due process as it was not given an opportunity to prove before the Regional Director that private respondents had already severed their employment with the corporation and had been paid the claimed monetary benefits because they were never notified of the inspection results nor of the hearings conducted.\n\nAt this juncture, it would be wise to stress that the arguments espoused by petitioner in support of its position are anchored on alleged facts the contrary of which have been found by the Regional Director, the Undersecretary of Labor, and the Court of Appeals. In essence, petitioner implores this Court to ascertain and evaluate certain material facts which, however, are not within the province of the Court to consider in petitions for review, especially since said facts have already been determined by the administrative agency involved and such findings thereafter affirmed by the appellate court.\n\nAs a rule, findings of fact by administrative agencies are accorded great respect, if not finality by the courts. As stated in the case of Villaflor v. Court of Appeals [7] :\nThe findings of fact of an administrative agency must be respected as long as they are supported by substantial evidence, even if such evidence might not be overwhelming or even preponderant. It is not the task of an appellate court to weigh once more the evidence submitted before the administrative body and to substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency in respect of sufficiency of evidence. Furthermore, as a general rule, findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are final and conclusive and cannot be reviewed on appeal by the Supreme Court, provided they are borne out by the record or based on substantial evidence. [8] It is not the function of this Court to analyze or weigh evidence all over again, unless there is a showing that the findings of the lower court are totally devoid of support or are glaringly erroneous as to constitute palpable error or grave abuse of discretion. [9]\n\nTherefore, this Court not being a trier of facts cannot pass upon the authenticity and veracity of the quitclaim and release forms \u2014 the only piece of evidence presented by petitioner to support its contention that no employer-employee relationship exists between petitioner and private respondents at the time of the filing of the complaint. The said quitclaim and release forms had already been considered by both the Undersecretary of Labor and the Court of Appeals and found to be \"unreliable and do not correspond to other documents on record which would prove that private respondents were working for the petitioner up to August 1997.\" [10] The conclusion reached by both the Undersecretary of Labor and the Court of Appeals, after thoroughly considering all pieces of evidence presented before them regarding this issue, must now be regarded with great respect and finality by this Court.\n\nWhile it is true that there are instances when this Court may resolve factual issues, such as: 1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; 6) when in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; 7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; 8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; 10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; or 11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; [11] however, none of these exceptions are applicable in the instant case.\n\nConsidering thus that there still exists an employer-employee relationship between petitioner and private respondents and that the case involves violations of labor standard provisions of the Labor Code, we agree with the Undersecretary of Labor and the appellate court that the Regional Director has jurisdiction to hear and decide the instant case in conformity with Article 128(b) of the Labor Code which states:\nArt. 128. Visitorial and Enforcement Power. \u2014\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 129 and 217 of this Code to the contrary, and in cases where the relationship of employer-employee still exists, the Secretary of Labor and Employment or his duly authorized representatives shall have the power to issue compliance orders to give effect to the labor standards provisions of this Code and other labor legislation based on the findings of labor employment and enforcement officers or industrial safety engineers made in the course of inspection. The Secretary or his duly authorized representatives shall issue writs of execution to the appropriate authority for the enforcement of their orders, except in cases where the employer contests the findings of the labor employment and enforcement officer and raises issues supported by documentary proofs which were not considered in the course of inspection. [12] With respect to petitioner's claim that it had been denied due process as it was not served a copy of the inspection report and neither was it notified of the hearings, thus refusing it the opportunity to contest the findings of the Labor Enforcement Officer and the jurisdiction of the Regional Director, We cannot but agree with both the Undersecretary of Labor and the Court of Appeals that such assertion is bereft of merit. A perusal of the records will reveal that petitioner corporation's manager Mr. Jae Kwan Lee was served a copy of the Inspection Report and that the same was explained to him on the same day that the said inspection was conducted. As correctly pointed out by the Undersecretary of Labor, by affixing his signature thereon, Mr. Jae Kwan Lee acknowledged receipt of the same and that he has understood its contents. Nevertheless, petitioner failed to object to the findings of the Labor Enforcement Officer. Moreover, petitioner was again given an opportunity to contest such findings when it was summoned by the Office of Chief Labor Enforcement Division to attend the summary investigation on 8 and 22 September 1997, but petitioner failed to attend. It was only after the Regional Director issued an order adjudging petitioner liable to pay private respondents the amount of P1,382,332.80 that it commenced to question the jurisdiction of the Regional Director over the complaints of private respondents. Evidently, petitioner was never denied its right to due process, but rather it chose not to participate in the proceedings until an order unfavorable to its interests was issued.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition for review is hereby DENIED .

(Springfield) bought Lot No. 2291-C with an area of 68,732 square meters, and Lot No. 2291-D with an area of 49,778 square meters. [1] Springfield developed these properties into a subdivision project called Mega Heights Subdivision. [2]\n\nOn May 4, 1990, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), through its Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer, issued a Notice of Coverage, [3] placing the property under the coverage of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988.\u00a0 There being an opposition from the heirs of Petra Piit, the case was docketed as DARAB Case No. X-305.\u00a0 On August 27, 1991, DARAB Provincial Adjudicator Abeto A. Salcedo, Jr. rendered a decision declaring the nature of the property as residential and not suitable for agriculture. [4] The Regional Director filed a notice of appeal, which the Provincial Adjudicator disallowed for being pro forma and frivolous. [5] The decision became final and executory [6] and Springfield proceeded to develop the property. [7]\n\nThe DAR Regional Director then filed a petition for relief from judgment of the DARAB Decision, docketed as DARAB Case No. 0555.\u00a0 In its Decision dated October 5, 1995, the DARAB granted the petition and gave due course to the Notice of Coverage.\u00a0 It also directed the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office to proceed with the documentation, acquisition, and distribution of the property to the true and lawful beneficiaries. [8]\n\nThe DARAB also issued an Order dated May 22, 1997, ordering the heirs of Piit and Springfield to pay the farmer-beneficiaries the amount of Twelve Million, Three Hundred Forty Thousand, Eight Hundred Pesos (P12,340,800.00), corresponding to the value of the property since the property has already been developed into a subdivision.\n\nOn June 13, 1997, Springfield and the heirs of Piit (petitioners) filed with the RTC of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 40, a petition for annulment of the DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995 and all its subsequent proceedings. Petitioners contend that the DARAB decision was rendered without affording petitioners any notice and hearing. [9]\n\nOn motion filed by the farmer-beneficiaries, the RTC issued an Order dated June 25, 1997, dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction. [10]\n\nOn July 2, 1997, petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals (CA) a special civil action for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition with prayer for the issuance of writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 44563. [11] Petitioners alleged that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that the annulment of judgment filed before it is actually an action for certiorari in a different color. According to petitioners, what it sought before the RTC is an annulment of the DARAB Decision and not certiorari , as the DARAB Decision is void ab initio for having been rendered without due process of law. [12]\n\nIn the assailed Decision [13] dated July 16, 1998, the CA dismissed the petition for lack of merit, ruling that the RTC does not have jurisdiction to annul the DARAB Decision because it is a co-equal body. [14]\n\nHowever, on January 12, 1999, the CA ordered the elevation of the DARAB records before it, declaring that it \"overlooked the fact that petitioners likewise applied for a writ of prohibition against the enforcement of the DARAB decision which they claim to be patently void.\" [15] Forwarded to the CA were the records of the original case filed with the DARAB-Region X, and it appearing that the petition for relief from judgment and its pertinent records were forwarded to the DARAB Central Office, the CA issued another Resolution on December 20, 1999, [16] requiring the DARAB Central Office to forward the records of the case.\u00a0 But after receipt of the records, the CA simply denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration per Resolution [17] dated February 23, 2000 without specifically resolving the issues raised concerning the prayer for a writ of prohibition.\n\nHence, the present petition on the following grounds:\nI\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A CLEAR ERROR OF LAW IN APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL STABILITY TO JUSTIFY ITS CONCLUSION DIVESTING THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF ITS JURISDICTION VESTED BY LAW OVER CASES WHERE THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION WAS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED TO ANY OTHER COURTS [SIC] OR TRIBUNAL, IN EFFECT, MODIFYING THE APPLICABLE LAW ON THE MATTER.\n\nII\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS IRREGULARLY DISMISSED PETITIONERS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AFTER IT HAD RESOLVED TO ENTERTAIN PETITIONERS' PETITION FOR PROHIBITION AND TO REVIEW THE DARAB PROCEEDINGS, THEREBY DEPARTING FROM THE USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\nIII\n\nTHE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT, BEING THE HIGHEST TEMPLE OF RIGHTS, AND TO AVOID SERIOUS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE AND NEEDLESS DELAYS, IS MOST RESPECTFULLY URGED TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE PETITION FILED IN CA-G.R. SP No. 44563 IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS CONCURRENT JURISDICTION, AS IF THE PETITION WAS ORIGINALLY LODGED BEFORE IT. [18] Petitioners argue that under Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 129, there is no provision that vests with the CA jurisdiction over actions for annulment of DARAB judgments.\u00a0 Petitioners, however, contend that the RTC may take cognizance of the annulment case since Section 19 of B.P. Blg. 129 vests the RTC with general jurisdiction and an action for annulment is covered under such general jurisdiction.\u00a0 According to petitioners, \"this is but a logical consequence of the fact that no other courts were expressly given the jurisdiction over such actions.\" [19] Petitioners further argue that the CA was in error when it summarily ignored their application for a writ of prohibition, as it was necessary to restrain the DARAB from enforcing its void decision; and even if the DARAB decision was valid, the writ of prohibition could have enjoined the execution of the DARAB decision since there have been changes which will make the execution unjust and inequitable.\n\nIn their Joint-Comments, the farmer-beneficiaries and the DARAB (respondents) refute petitioners' allegation that they were not afforded due process in the DARAB proceedings, stating that petitioners were impleaded as a party thereto, and in fact, they attended some of the hearings although their counsel was absent.\u00a0 Respondents also adopt the CA's ruling that the RTC is not vested with any jurisdiction to annul the DARAB decision.\n\nAs stated at the outset, the main issue in this case is whether the RTC has jurisdiction to annul a final judgment of the DARAB.\n\nNote must be made that the petition for annulment of the DARAB decision was filed with the RTC on June 13, 1997, before the advent of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect on July 1, 1997.\u00a0 Thus, the applicable law is B.P. Blg. 129 or the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, enacted on August 10, 1981.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that before the effectivity of B.P. Blg. 129, a court of first instance has the authority to annul a final and executory judgment rendered by another court of first instance or by another branch of the same court.\u00a0 This was the Court's ruling in Dulap v. Court of Appeals . [20] Yet, in subsequent cases, [21] the Court held that the better policy, as a matter of comity or courteous interaction between courts of first instance and the branches thereof, is for the annulment cases to be tried by the same court or branch which heard the main action.\n\nThe foregoing doctrines were modified in Ngo Bun Tiong v. Sayo , [22] where the Court expressed that pursuant to the policy of judicial stability, the doctrine of non-interference between concurrent and coordinate courts should be regarded as highly important in the administration of justice whereby the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be opened, modified or vacated by any court of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nWith the introduction of B.P. Blg. 129, [23] the rule on annulment of judgments was specifically provided in Section 9(2), which vested in the then Intermediate Appellate Court (now the CA) the exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments of RTCs.\u00a0 Sec. 9(3) of B.P. Blg. 129 also vested the CA with \"exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders, or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the provisions of this Act, and of sub-paragraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.\"\u00a0 As provided in paragraph 16 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines implementing B.P. Blg. 129, the quasi-judicial bodies whose decisions are exclusively appealable to the CA are those, which under the law, R.A. No. 5434, [24] or its enabling acts, are specifically appealable to the CA.\n\nSignificantly, B.P. Blg. 129 does not specifically provide for any power of the RTC to annul judgments of quasi-judicial bodies.\u00a0 However, in BF Northwest Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court , [25] the Court ruled that the RTCs have jurisdiction over actions for annulment of the decisions of the National Water Resources Council, which is a quasi-judicial body ranked with inferior courts, pursuant to its original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, under Sec. 21(1) of B.P. Blg. 129, in relation to acts or omissions of an inferior court.\u00a0 This led to the conclusion that despite the absence of any provision in B.P. Blg. 129, the RTC had the power to entertain petitions for annulment of judgments of inferior courts and administrative or quasi-judicial bodies of equal ranking .\u00a0 This is also in harmony with the \"pre-B.P. Blg. 129\" rulings of the Court recognizing the power of a trial court (court of first instance) to annul final judgments. [26] Hence, while it is true, as petitioners contend, that the RTC had the authority to annul final judgments, such authority pertained only to final judgments rendered by inferior courts and quasi-judicial bodies of equal ranking with such inferior courts .\n\nThe foregoing statements beg the next question, i.e. , whether the DARAB is a quasi-judicial body with the rank of an inferior court such that the RTC may take cognizance of an action for the annulments of its judgments.\u00a0 The answer is no.\n\nThe DARAB is a quasi-judicial body created by Executive Order Nos. 229 and 129-A.\u00a0 R.A. No. 6657 delineated its adjudicatory powers and functions.\u00a0 The DARAB Revised Rules of Procedure adopted on December 26, 1988 [27] specifically provides for the manner of judicial review of its decisions, orders, rulings, or awards.\u00a0 Rule XIV, Section 1 states:\nSECTION 1. Certiorari to the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 Any decision, order, award or ruling by the Board or its Adjudicators on any agrarian dispute or on any matter pertaining to the application, implementation, enforcement or interpretation of agrarian reform laws or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, may be brought within fifteen (15) days from receipt of a copy thereof, to the Court of Appeals by certiorari, except as provided in the next succeeding section.\u00a0 Notwithstanding an appeal to the Court of Appeals the decision of the Board or Adjudicator appealed from, shall be immediately executory. Further, the prevailing 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, expressly provides for an appeal from the DARAB decisions to the CA. [28]\n\nThe rule is that where legislation provides for an appeal from decisions of certain administrative bodies to the CA, it means that such bodies are co-equal with the RTC, in terms of rank and stature, and logically, beyond the control of the latter. [29]\n\nGiven that DARAB decisions are appealable to the CA, the inevitable conclusion is that the DARAB is a co-equal body with the RTC and its decisions are beyond the RTC's control .\u00a0 The CA was therefore correct in sustaining the RTC's dismissal of the petition for annulment of the DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995, as the RTC does not have any jurisdiction to entertain the same.\n\nThis brings to fore the issue of whether the petition for annulment of the DARAB judgment could be brought to the CA.\u00a0 As previously noted, Section 9(2) of B.P. Blg. 129 vested in the CA the exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments, but only those rendered by the RTCs.\u00a0 It does not expressly give the CA the power to annul judgments of quasi-judicial bodies.\u00a0 Thus, in Elcee Farms, Inc. v. Semillano , [30] the Court affirmed the ruling of the CA that it has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition for annulment of a final and executory judgment of the NLRC, citing Section 9 of B.P. Blg. 129, as amended, which only vests in the CA \"exclusive jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments of Regional Trial Courts.\"\u00a0 This was reiterated in Galang v. Court of Appeals , [31] where the Court ruled that that the CA is without jurisdiction to entertain a petition for annulment of judgment of a final decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRecent rulings on similar cases involving annulments of judgments of quasi-judicial bodies are also quite instructive on this matter.\n\nIn Cole v. Court of Appeals , [32] involving an annulment of the judgment of the HLURB Arbiter and the Office of the President (OP), filed with the CA, the Court stated that, \"(U)nder Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, the remedy of annulment of judgment is confined to decisions of the Regional Trial Court on the ground of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction x\u00a0 x\u00a0 x.\"\u00a0 The Court further ruled, viz.\nAlthough the grounds set forth in the petition for annulment of judgment are fraud and lack of jurisdiction, said petition cannot prosper for the simple reason that the decision sought to be annulled was not rendered by the Regional Trial Court but by an administrative agency (HLU Arbiter and Office of the President), hence, not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 There is no such remedy as annulment of judgment of the HLURB or the Office of the President. Assuming arguendo that the annulment petition can be treated as a petition for review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the same should have been dismissed by the Court of Appeals, because no error of judgment was imputed to the HLURB and the Office of the President.\u00a0 Fraud and lack of jurisdiction are beyond the province of petitions under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, as it covers only errors of judgment.\u00a0 A petition for annulment of judgment is an initiatory remedy, hence no error of judgment can be the subject thereof.\u00a0 Besides, the Arbiter and the Office of the President indisputably have jurisdiction over the cases brought before them in line with our ruling in Francisco Sycip, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals , promulgated on March 17, 2000, where the aggrieved townhouse buyers may seek protection from the HLURB under Presidential Decree No. 957, otherwise known as \"Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree.\" [33] (Emphasis supplied) In Macalalag v. Ombudsman, [34] the Court ruled that Rule 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure on annulment of judgments or final orders and resolutions covers \"annulment by the Court of Appeals of judgments or final orders and resolutions in civil actions of Regional Trial Courts for which the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies could no longer be availed of through no fault of the petitioner.\" Thus, the Court concluded that judgments or final orders and resolutions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases cannot be annulled by the CA, more so, since The Ombudsman Act specifically deals with the remedy of an aggrieved party from orders, directives and decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases only, and the right to appeal is not to be considered granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal or non-administrative cases.\n\nWhile these cases involve annulments of judgments under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, still, they still find application in the present case, as the provisions of B.P. Blg. 129 and the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, on annulment of judgments are identical.\n\nConsequently, the silence of B.P. Blg. 129 on the jurisdiction of the CA to annul judgments or final orders and resolutions of quasi-judicial bodies like the DARAB indicates its lack of such authority.\n\nFurther, petitioners are also asking the Court to take cognizance of their prayer for the issuance of a writ of prohibition, which they claim was not acted upon by the CA, citing the Court's action in Fortich v. Corona [35] where the Court took cognizance of the petition previously filed with the CA due to compelling reasons.\u00a0 The Court is not persuaded to do so.\n\nFortich involved a 144-hectare land located at San Vicente, Sumilao, Bukidnon, owned by the Norberto Quisumbing, Sr. Management and Development Corporation (NQSRMDC), which was leased as a pineapple plantation to Del Monte Philippines, Inc. for a period of 10 years.\u00a0 During the existence of the lease, the DAR placed the entire 144-hectare property under compulsory acquisition and assessed the land value at P2.38 million.\u00a0 When the NQSRMDC/BAIDA (Bukidnon Agro-Industrial Development Association) filed an application for conversion due to the passage of Resolution No. 6 by the Provincial Development Council of Bukidnon and Ordinance No. 24 by the Sangguniang Bayan of Sumilao, Bukidnon, reclassifying the area from agricultural to industrial/institutional, the same was disapproved by the DAR Secretary and instead, the property was placed under the compulsory coverage of Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program for distribution to all qualified beneficiaries.\u00a0 This prompted Governor Carlos O. Fortich of Bukidnon to file an appeal with the OP, while NQSRMDC filed with the CA a petition for certiorari , and prohibition with preliminary injunction.\n\nThe OP then issued a Decision dated March 29, 1996 reversing the DAR Secretary's decision and approving the application for conversion.\u00a0 Executive Secretary Ruben D. Torres denied the DAR's motion for reconsideration for having been filed beyond the reglementary period of 15 days, and it was also declared that the OP Decision dated March 29, 1996 had already become final and executory.\n\nBecause of this, the farmer-beneficiaries staged a hunger strike on October 9, 1997, protesting the OP's decision.\u00a0 In order to resolve the strike, the OP issued a so-called \"Win/Win\" resolution on November 7, 1997, modifying the decision in that NQSRMDC's application for conversion is approved only with respect to the approximately 44-hectare portion of the land adjacent to the highway, as recommended by the Department of Agriculture, while the remaining approximately 100 hectares traversed by an irrigation canal and found to be suitable for agriculture shall be distributed to qualified farmer-beneficiaries.\n\nA petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court [36] was then filed with the Court, which was contested by the Office of the Solicitor General on the ground that the proper remedy should have been to file a petition for review directly with the CA in accordance with Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court.\n\nIn resolving the issue, the Court recognized the rule that the Supreme Court, CA and RTC have original concurrent jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus .\u00a0 However, due to compelling reasons and in the interest of speedy justice, the Court resolved to take primary jurisdiction over the petition in the interest of speedy justice, after which the Court nullified the act of the OP in re-opening the case and substantially modifying its March 29, 1996 Decision which had already become final and executory, as it was in gross disregard of the rules and basic legal precept that accord finality to administrative determinations.\n\nIt must be stressed at this point that the Court, as a rule, will not entertain direct resort to it unless the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts, and exceptional and compelling circumstances, such as cases of national interest and of serious implications, justify the availment of the extraordinary remedy of writ of certiorari, prohibition, or mandamus calling for the exercise of its primary jurisdiction. [37] The Court finds no compelling circumstances in this case to warrant a relaxation of the foregoing rule.\u00a0\u00a0 The Fortich case is not analogous with the present case such that the Court is not bound to abandon all rules, take primary jurisdiction, and resolve the merits of petitioners' application for a writ of prohibition.\n\nIn the present case, the assailed DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995 granting the petition for relief from judgment and giving due course to the Notice of Coverage was made pursuant to a petition for relief from judgment filed by the DAR, albeit petitioners are contesting the validity of the proceedings held thereon.\u00a0 On the other hand, in Fortich, the OP's \"Win/Win\" resolution dated November 7, 1997 was made motu proprio, as a result of the hunger strike staged by the farmer-beneficiaries.\n\nFurther, the OP's \"Win/Win\" Resolution dated November 7, 1997 in the Fortich case is a patently void judgment since it was evident that there was already an existing final and executory OP Decision dated March 29, 1996.\u00a0 In this case, the assailed DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995 appears to be regular on its face, and for its alleged nullity to be resolved, the Court must delve into the records of the case in order to determine the validity of petitioners' argument of lack of due process, absent notice and hearing.\n\nMoreover, the principle of hierarchy of courts applies generally to cases involving factual questions.\u00a0 As it is not a trier of facts, the Court cannot entertain cases involving factual issues. [38] The question of whether the DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995 is null and void and enforceable against petitioners for having been rendered without affording petitioners due process is a factual question which requires a review of the records of this case for it to be judiciously resolved.\n\nThe Court notes that the CA, indeed, failed to resolve petitioners' prayer for the issuance of the writ of prohibition, which, significantly, focuses on the alleged nullity of the DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995.\u00a0 On this score, the CA found that the application for the issuance of the writ of prohibition was actually a collateral attack on the validity of the DARAB decision.\u00a0 But, a final and executory judgment may be set aside in three ways; [39] and a collateral attack, whereby in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the judgment is nevertheless made as an incident thereof, [40] is one of these.\u00a0 This tenet is based upon a court's inherent authority to expunge void acts from its records. [41] Despite recognizing the need to resolve petitioners' application for the writ of prohibition in its Resolution dated January 12, 1999, the CA nonetheless summarily denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration in its Resolution dated February 23, 2000, [42] leaving the matter hanging and unresolved.\n\nAt first, the Court considered resolving the merits of petitioners' motion for reconsideration concerning their application for a writ of prohibition against enforcing the DARAB Decision dated October 5, 1995.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, in a Resolution dated June 5, 2006, the Court directed the CA to transmit the records of DARAB Case No. 0555, which was previously required by the CA to be forwarded to it per Resolution dated December 20, 1999. [43] However, as of even date, the CA has not complied with the Court's Resolution.\u00a0 Withal, upon re-examination of the issues involved in this case, the Court deems it more judicious to remand this case to the CA for immediate resolution of petitioners' motion for reconsideration, re: their application for the writ of prohibition.\n\nMoreover, the radical conflict in the findings of the Provincial Adjudicator and the DARAB as regards the nature of the subject property necessitates a review of the present case.\u00a0 In this regard, the CA is in a better position to fully adjudicate the case for it can delve into the records to determine the probative value of the evidence supporting the findings of the Provincial Adjudicator and of the DARAB.\u00a0 In addition, the CA is empowered by its internal rules to require parties to submit additional documents, as it may find necessary to promote the ends of substantial justice, and further order the transmittal of the proper records for it to fully adjudicate the case.\u00a0 After all, it is an avowed policy of the courts that cases should be determined on the merits, after full opportunity to all parties for ventilation of their causes and defenses, rather than on technicality or some procedural imperfections.\u00a0 In that way, the ends of justice would be served better. [44]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED .\u00a0 This case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals which is DIRECTED to resolve petitioners' prayer for the issuance of the writ of prohibition in their Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nUpon finality of this Decision, let the records be remanded forthwith to the Court of Appeals.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Leaving out 4,898 square meters.\n\n[2] Rollo, pp. 57-58, CA Decision dated July 16, 1998.\n\n[3] Records, p. 42.\n\n[4] Id. at 13-16.\n\n[5] Id. at 32-33.\n\n[6] Id. at 81.\n\n[7] Rollo, p. 58.\n\n[8] Id. at 134-142.\n\n[9] Id. at 90-99.\n\n[10] Id. at 87-89.\n\n[11] CA rollo, p. 2.\n\n[12] Rollo, pp. 74-83.\n\n[13] Penned by Associate Justice Hector L.

      "title": "METROPOLITAN BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION AND REGIONAL TRIPARTITE WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY BOARD - REGION II, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.: Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated July 19, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 42240 which denied the petition for certiorari and prohibition of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. (petitioner).The procedural antecedents and factual background of the case are as follows:On October 17, 1995, the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board, Region II, Tuguegarao, Cagayan (RTWPB), by virtue of Republic Act No. 6727 (R.A. No. 6727), otherwise known as the Wage Rationalization Act,[2] issued Wage Order No. R02-03 (Wage Order), as follows:Section 1. Upon effectivity of this Wage Order, all employees/workers in the private sector throughout Region II, regardless of the status of employment are granted an across-the-board increase of P15.00 daily.[3]The Wage Order was published in a newspaper of general circulation on December 2, 1995[4] and took effect on January 1, 1996.[5] Its Implementing Rules[6] were approved on February 14, 1996.[7] Per Section 13 of the Wage Order, any party aggrieved by the Wage Order may file an appeal with the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) through the RTWPB within 10 calendar days from the publication of the Wage Order.In a letter-inquiry to the NWPC dated May 7, 1996, the Bankers' Council for Personnel Management (BCPM), on behalf of its member-banks, requested for a ruling on the eligibility of establishments with head offices outside Region II to seek exemption from the coverage of the Wage Order since its member-banks are already paying more than the prevailing minimum wage rate in the National Capital Region (NCR), which is their principal place of business.[8]In a letter-reply dated July 16, 1996, the NWPC stated that the member-banks of BCPM are covered by the Wage Order and do not fall under the exemptible categories listed under the Wage Order.[9]In a letter-inquiry to the NWPC dated July 23, 1996, petitioner sought for interpretation of the applicability of said Wage Order.[10] The NWPC referred petitioner's inquiry to the RTWPB.In a letter-reply dated August 12, 1996, the RTWPB clarified that the Wage Order covers all private establishments situated in Region II, regardless of the voluntary adoption by said establishments of the wage orders established in Metro Manila and irrespective of the amounts already paid by the petitioner.[11]On October 15, 1996, the petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the CA seeking nullification of the Wage Order on grounds that the RTWPB acted without authority when it issued the questioned Wage Order; that even assuming that the RTWPB was vested with the authority to prescribe an increase, it exceeded its authority when it did so without any ceiling or qualification; that the implementation of the Wage Order will cause the petitioner, and other similarly situated employers, to incur huge financial losses and suffer labor unrest.[12]On March 24, 1997, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Manifestation and Motion in lieu of Comment affirming the petitioner's claim that the RTWPB acted beyond its authority in issuing the Wage Order prescribing an across-the-board increase to all workers and employees in Region II, effectively granting additional or other benefits not contemplated by R.A. No. 6727.[13]In view of the OSG's manifestation, the CA directed respondents NWPC and RTWPB to file their comment.[14]On September 22, 1997, respondents filed their Comment praying that the petition should be dismissed outright for petitioner's procedural lapses; that certiorari and prohibition are unavailing since petitioner failed to avail of the remedy of appeal prescribed by the Wage Order; that the Wage Order has long been in effect; and that the issuance of the Wage Order was performed in the exercise of a purely administrative function.[15]On July 19, 2000, the CA rendered its Decision denying the petition. The appellate court held that a writ of prohibition can no longer be issued since implementation of the Wage Order had long become fait accompli, the Wage Order having taken effect on January 1, 1996 and its implementing rules approved on February 14, 1996; that a writ of certiorari is improper since the Wage Order was issued in the exercise of a purely administrative function, not judicial or quasi-judicial; that the letter-query did not present justiciable controversies ripe for consideration by the respondents in the exercise of their wage-fixing function, since no appeal from the Wage Order was filed; that petitioner never brought before the said bodies any formal and definite challenge to the Wage Order and it cannot pass off the letter-queries as actual applications for relief; that even if petitioner's procedural lapse is disregarded, a regional wage order prescribing a wage increase across-the-board applies to banks adopting a unified wage system and a disparity in wages between employees holding similar positions in different regions is not wage distortion.[16]Hence, the present petition anchored on the following grounds:4.1 THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN REFUSING TO DECLARE WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 NULL AND VOID AND OF NO LEGAL EFFECT.4.1.1 THE BOARD, IN ISSUING WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03, EXCEEDED THE AUTHORITY DELEGATED TO IT BY CONGRESS.4.1.2 WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 IS AN UNREASONABLE INTRUSION INTO THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PETITIONER.4.1.3 WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 UNDERMINES THE VERY ESSENCE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.4.1.4 WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 FAILS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VERY RATIONALE FOR A UNIFIED WAGE STRUCTURE.4.2 PETITIONER'S RECOURSE TO A WRIT OF CERTIORARI AND PROHIBITION WAS PROPER.[17]Following the submission of the Comment[18] and Reply[19] thereto, the Court gave due course to the petition and required both parties to submit their respective memoranda.[20] In compliance therewith, petitioner and respondents submitted their respective memoranda.[21]Petitioner poses two issues for resolution, to wit: (1) whether Wage Order No. R02-03 is void and of no legal effect; and (2) whether petitioner's recourse to a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the CA was proper.Anent the first issue, petitioner maintains that the RTWPB, in issuing said Wage Order, exceeded the authority delegated to it under R.A. No. 6727, which is limited to determining and fixing the minimum wage rate within their respective territorial jurisdiction and with respect only to employees who do not earn the prescribed minimum wage rate; that the RTWPB is not authorized to grant a general across-the-board wage increase for non-minimum wage earners; that Employers Confederation of the Philippines v. National Wages and Productivity Commission[22] (hereafter referred to as \"ECOP\") is not authority to rule that respondents have been empowered to fix wages other than the minimum wage since said case dealt with an across-the-board increase with a salary ceiling, where the wage adjustment is applied to employees receiving a certain denominated salary ceiling; that the Wage Order is an unreasonable intrusion into its property rights; that the Wage Order undermines the essence of collective bargaining; that the Wage Order fails to take into account the rationale for a unified wage structure.As to the second issue, petitioner submits that ultra vires acts of administrative agencies are correctible by way of a writ of certiorari and prohibition; that even assuming that it did not observe the proper remedial procedure in challenging the Wage Order, the remedy of certiorari and prohibition remains available to it by way of an exception, on grounds of justice and equity; that its failure to observe procedural rules could not have validated the manner by which the disputed Wage Order was issued.Respondents counter that the present petition is fatally defective from inception since no appeal from the Wage Order was filed by petitioner; that the letter-query to the NWPC did not constitute the appeal contemplated by law; that the validity of the Wage Order was never raised before the respondents; that the implementation of the Wage Order had long become fait accompli for prohibition to prosper. Respondents insist that, even if petitioner's procedural lapses are disregarded, the Wage Order was issued pursuant to the mandate of R.A. No. 6727 and in accordance with the Court's pronouncements in the ECOP case;[23] that the Wage Order is not an intrusion on property rights since it was issued after the required public hearings; that the Wage Order does not undermine but in fact recognizes the right to collective bargaining; that the Wage Order did not result in wage distortion.The Court shall first dispose of the procedural matter relating to the propriety of petitioner's recourse to the CA before proceeding with the substantive issue involving the validity of the Wage Order.Certiorari as a special civil action is available only if the following essential requisites concur: (1) it must be directed against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) the tribunal, board, or officer must have acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[24]On the other hand, prohibition as a special civil action is available only if the following essential requisites concur: (1) it must be directed against a tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person exercising functions, judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial; (2) the tribunal, corporation, board or person has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[25]A respondent is said to be exercising judicial function where he has the power to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties.[26] Quasi-judicial function is a term which applies to the action, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers or bodies, who are required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature.[27] Ministerial function is one which an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard to the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.[28]In the issuance of the assailed Wage Order, respondent RTWPB did not act in any judicial, quasi-judicial capacity, or ministerial capacity. It was in the nature of subordinate legislation, promulgated by it in the exercise of delegated power under R.A. No. 6727. It was issued in the exercise of quasi-legislative power. Quasi-legislative or rule-making power is exercised by administrative agencies through the promulgation of rules and regulations within the confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non-delegation of certain powers flowing from the separation of the great branches of the government.[29]Moreover, the rule on the special civil actions of certiorari and prohibition equally mandate that these extra-ordinary remedies are available only when \"there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\" A remedy is considered plain, speedy and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment or rule, order or resolution of the lower court or agency.[30]Section 13 of the assailed Wage Order explicitly provides that any party aggrieved by the Wage Order may file an appeal with the NWPC through the RTWPB within 10 days from the publication of the wage order.[31] The Wage Order was published in a newspaper of general circulation on December 2, 1995.[32]In this case, petitioner did not avail of the remedy provided by law. No appeal to the NWPC was filed by the petitioner within 10 calendar days from publication of the Wage Order on December 2, 1995. Petitioner was silent until seven months later, when it filed a letter-inquiry on July 24, 1996 with the NWPC seeking a clarification on the application of the Wage Order. Evidently, the letter-inquiry is not an appeal.It must also be noted that the NWPC only referred petitioner's letter-inquiry to the RTWPB. Petitioner did not appeal the letter-reply dated August 12, 1996 of the RTWPB to the NWPC. No direct action was taken by the NWPC on the issuance or implementation of the Wage Order. Petitioner failed to invoke the power of the NWPC to review regional wage levels set by the RTWPB to determine if these are in accordance with prescribed guidelines. Thus, not only was it improper to implead the NWPC as party-respondent in the petition before the CA and this Court, but also petitioner failed to avail of the primary jurisdiction of the NWPC under Article 121 of the Labor Code, to wit:ART. 121. Powers and Functions of the Commission. - The Commission shall have the following powers and functions:x x x x(d) To review regional wage levels set by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards to determine if these are in accordance with prescribed guidelines and national development plans;x x x x(f) To review plans and programs of the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards to determine whether these are consistent with national development plans;(g) To exercise technical and administrative supervision over the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards;x x x x(Emphasis supplied)Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, courts cannot and will not resolve a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal, especially where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact.[33]Nevertheless, the Court will proceed to resolve the substantial issues in the present petition pursuant to the well-accepted principle that acceptance of a petition for certiorari or prohibition as well as the grant of due course thereto is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.[34] It is a well-entrenched principle that rules of procedure are not inflexible tools designed to hinder or delay, but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate, rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed.[35]As to respondents' submission that the implementation of the Wage Order can no longer be restrained since it has become fait accompli, the Wage Order having taken effect on January 1, 1996 and its implementing rules approved on February 14, 1996, suffice it to state that courts will decide a question otherwise moot if it is capable of repetition yet evading review.[36] Besides, a case becomes moot and academic only when there is no more actual controversy between the parties or no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits. Such circumstances do not obtain in the present case. The implementation of the Wage Order does not in any way render the case moot and academic, since the issue of the validity of the wage order subsists even after its implementation and which has to be determined and passed upon to resolve petitioner's rights and consequent obligations therein.It is worthy to quote the Court's pronouncements in Tan v. Commission on Elections,[37] thus:For this Honorable Court to yield to the respondents' urging that, as there has been fait accompli, then this Honorable Court should passively accept and accede to the prevailing situation is an unacceptable suggestion. Dismissal of the instant petition, as respondents so propose is a proposition fraught with mischief. Respondents' submission will create a dangerous precedent. Should this Honorable Court decline now to perform its duty of interpreting and indicating what the law is and should be, this might tempt again those who strut about in the corridors of power to recklessly and with ulterior motives commit illegal acts, either brazenly or stealthily, confident that this Honorable Court will abstain from entertaining future challenges to their acts if they manage to bring about a fait accompli.[38]Having disposed of this procedural issue, the Court now comes to the substance of the petition.R.A. No. 6727 declared it a policy of the State to rationalize the fixing of minimum wages and to promote productivity-improvement and gain-sharing measures to ensure a decent standard of living for the workers and their families; to guarantee the rights of labor to its just share in the fruits of production; to enhance employment generation in the countryside through industrial dispersal; and to allow business and industry reasonable returns on investment, expansion and growth.[39]In line with its declared policy, R.A. No. 6727[40] created the NWPC,[41] vested with the power to prescribe rules and guidelines for the determination of appropriate minimum wage and productivity measures at the regional, provincial or industry levels;[42] and authorized the RTWPB to determine and fix the minimum wage rates applicable in their respective regions, provinces, or industries therein and issue the corresponding wage orders, subject to the guidelines issued by the NWPC.[43] Pursuant to its wage fixing authority, the RTWPB may issue wage orders which set the daily minimum wage rates,[44] based on the standards or criteria set by Article 124[45] of the Labor Code.In ECOP,[46] the Court declared that there are two ways of fixing the minimum wage: the \"floor-wage\" method and the \"salary-ceiling\" method. The \"floor-wage\" method involves the fixing of a determinate amount to be added to the prevailing statutory minimum wage rates. On the other hand, in the \"salary-ceiling\" method, the wage adjustment was to be applied to employees receiving a certain denominated salary ceiling. In other words, workers already being paid more than the existing minimum wage (up to a certain amount stated in the Wage Order) are also to be given a wage increase.[47]To illustrate: under the \"floor wage method\", it would have been sufficient if the Wage Order simply set P15.00 as the amount to be added to the prevailing statutory minimum wage rates, while in the \"salary-ceiling method\", it would have been sufficient if the Wage Order states a specific salary, such as P250.00, and only those earning below it shall be entitled to the salary increase.In the present case, the RTWPB did not determine or fix the minimum wage rate by the \"floor-wage method\" or the \"salary-ceiling method\" in issuing the Wage Order. The RTWPB did not set a wage level nor a range to which a wage adjustment or increase shall be added. Instead, it granted an across-the-board wage increase of P15.00 to all employees and workers of Region 2. In doing so, the RTWPB exceeded its authority by extending the coverage of the Wage Order to wage earners receiving more than the prevailing minimum wage rate, without a denominated salary ceiling. As correctly pointed out by the OSG, the Wage Order granted additional benefits not contemplated by R.A. No. 6727.In no uncertain terms must it be stressed that the function of promulgating rules and regulations may be legitimately exercised only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of a law. The power of administrative agencies is confined to implementing the law or putting it into effect. Corollary to this guideline is that administrative regulation cannot extend the law and amend a legislative enactment.[48] It is axiomatic that the clear letter of the law is controlling and cannot be amended by a mere administrative rule issued for its implementation.[49] Indeed, administrative or executive acts, orders, and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the laws or the Constitution.[50]Where the legislature has delegated to an executive or administrative officers and boards authority to promulgate rules to carry out an express legislative purpose, the rules of administrative officers and boards, which have the effect of extending, or which conflict with the authority-granting statute, do not represent a valid exercise of the rule-making power but constitute an attempt by an administrative body to legislate.[51]It has been said that when the application of an administrative issuance modifies existing laws or exceeds the intended scope, as in this case, the issuance becomes void, not only for being ultra vires, but also for being unreasonable.[52]Thus, the Court finds that Section 1, Wage Order No. R02-03 is void insofar as it grants a wage increase to employees earning more than the minimum wage rate; and pursuant to the separability clause[53] of the Wage Order, Section 1 is declared valid with respect to employees earning the prevailing minimum wage rate.Prior to the passage of the Wage Order, the daily minimum wage rates in Region II was set at P104.00 for the Province of Isabela, P103.00 for the Province of Cagayan, P101.00 for the Province of Nueva Vizcaya, and P100.00 for the Provinces of Quirino and Batanes.[54] Only employees earning the above-stated minimum wage rates are entitled to the P15.00 mandated increase under the Wage Order.Although the concomitant effect of the nullity of the Wage Order to those employees who have received the mandated increase was not put in issue, this Court shall make a definite pronouncement thereon to finally put this case to rest. As ruled by the Court in Latchme Motoomull v. Dela Paz,[55] \"the Court will always strive to settle the entire controversy in a single proceeding leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation.\"[56]Applying by analogy, the Court's recent pronouncement in Philippine Ports Authority v. Commission on Audit,[57] thus:In regard to the refund of the disallowed benefits, this Court holds that petitioners need not refund the benefits received by them based on our rulings in Blaquera v. Alcala, De Jesus v. Commission on Audit and Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Government Service Insurance System (KMG) v. Commission on Audit.In Blaquera, the petitioners, who were officials and employees of several government departments and agencies, were paid incentive benefits pursuant to EO No. 292 and the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO No. 292. On January 3, 1993, then President Fidel V. Ramos issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 29 authorizing the grant of productivity incentive benefits for the year 1992 in the maximum amount of P1,000. Section 4 of AO No. 29 directed all departments, offices and agencies which authorized payment of CY 1992 Productivity Incentive Bonus in excess of P1,000 to immediately cause the refund of the excess. Respondent heads of the departments or agencies of the government concerned caused the deduction from petitioners' salaries or allowances of the amounts needed to cover the overpayments. Petitioners therein filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before this Court to prevent respondents therein from making further deductions from their salaries or allowances. The Court ruled against the refund, thus:Considering, however, that all the parties here acted in good faith, we cannot countenance the refund of subject incentive benefits for the year 1992, which amounts the petitioners have already received. Indeed, no indicia of bad faith can be detected under the attendant facts and circumstances. The officials and chiefs of offices concerned disbursed such incentive benefits in the honest belief that the amounts given were due to the recipients and the latter accepted the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits.The said ruling in Blaquera was applied in De Jesus.In De Jesus, COA disallowed the payment of allowances and bonuses consisting of representation and transportation allowance, rice allowance, productivity incentive bonus, anniversary bonus, year-end bonus and cash gifts to members of the interim Board of Directors of the Catbalogan Water District. This Court affirmed the disallowance because petitioners therein were not entitled to other compensation except for payment of per diem under PD No. 198. However, the Court ruled against the refund of the allowances and bonuses received by petitioners, thus:This ruling in Blaquera applies to the instant case. Petitioners here received the additional allowances and bonuses in good faith under the honest belief that LWUA Board Resolution No. 313 authorized such payment. At the time petitioners received the additional allowances and bonuses, the Court had not yet decided Baybay Water District. Petitioners had no knowledge that such payment was without legal basis. Thus, being in good faith, petitioners need not refund the allowances and bonuses they received but disallowed by the COA.Further, in KMG, this Court applied the ruling in Blaquera and De Jesus in holding that the Social Insurance Group (SIG) personnel of the Government Service Insurance System need not refund the hazard pay received by them although said benefit was correctly disallowed by COA. The Court ruled:The Court however finds that the DOH and GSIS officials concerned who granted hazard pay under R.A. No. 7305 to the SIG personnel acted in good faith, in the honest belief that there was legal basis for such grant. The SIG personnel in turn accepted the hazard pay benefits likewise believing that they were entitled to such benefit. At that time, neither the concerned DOH and GSIS officials nor the SIG personnel knew that the grant of hazard pay to the latter is not sanctioned by law. Thus, following the rulings of the Court in De Jesus v. Commission on Audit, and Blaquera v. Alcala, the SIG personnel who previously received hazard pay under R.A. No. 7305 need not refund such benefits.In the same vein, the rulings in Blaquera, De Jesus and KMG apply to this case. Petitioners received the hazard duty pay and birthday cash gift in good faith since the benefits were authorized by PPA Special Order No. 407-97 issued pursuant to PPA Memorandum Circular No. 34-95 implementing DBM National Compensation Circular No. 76, series of 1995, and PPA Memorandum Circular No. 22-97, respectively. Petitioners at that time had no knowledge that the payment of said benefits lacked legal basis. Being in good faith, petitioners need not refund the benefits they received.[58] (Emphasis supplied)employees, other than minimum wage earners, who received the wage increase mandated by the Wage Order need not refund the wage increase received by them since they received the wage increase in good faith, in the honest belief that they are entitled to such wage increase and without any knowledge that there was no legal basis for the same.Considering the foregoing, the Court need not delve on the other arguments raised by the parties.WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated July 19, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 42240 is MODIFIED. Section 1 of Wage Order No. R02-03 issued on October 17, 1995 by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board for Region II, Tuguegarao, Cagayan is declared VALID insofar as the mandated increase applies to employees earning the prevailing minimum wage rate at the time of the passage of the Wage Order and VOID with respect to its application to employees receiving more than the prevailing minimum wage rate at the time of the passage of the Wage Order.No costs.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Godardo A.

NATIONAL WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION AND REGIONAL TRIPARTITE WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY BOARD - REGION II, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N\nMETROPOLITAN BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION AND REGIONAL TRIPARTITE WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY BOARD - REGION II, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated July 19, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 42240 which denied the petition for certiorari and prohibition of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. (petitioner).\n\nThe procedural antecedents and factual background of the case are as follows:\n\nOn October 17, 1995, the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board, Region II, Tuguegarao, Cagayan (RTWPB), by virtue of Republic Act No. 6727 (R.A. No. 6727), otherwise known as the Wage Rationalization Act, [2] issued Wage Order No. R02-03 (Wage Order), as follows:\nSection 1. Upon effectivity of this Wage Order, all employees/workers in the private sector throughout Region II, regardless of the status of employment are granted an across-the-board increase of P15.00 daily. [3] The Wage Order was published in a newspaper of general circulation on December 2, 1995 [4] and took effect on January 1, 1996. [5] Its Implementing Rules [6] were approved on February 14, 1996. [7] Per Section 13 of the Wage Order, any party aggrieved by the Wage Order may file an appeal with the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) through the RTWPB within 10 calendar days from the publication of the Wage Order.\n\nIn a letter-inquiry to the NWPC dated May 7, 1996, the Bankers' Council for Personnel Management (BCPM), on behalf of its member-banks, requested for a ruling on the eligibility of establishments with head offices outside Region II to seek exemption from the coverage of the Wage Order since its member-banks are already paying more than the prevailing minimum wage rate in the National Capital Region (NCR), which is their principal place of business. [8]\n\nIn a letter-reply dated July 16, 1996, the NWPC stated that the member-banks of BCPM are covered by the Wage Order and do not fall under the exemptible categories listed under the Wage Order. [9]\n\nIn a letter-inquiry to the NWPC dated July 23, 1996, petitioner sought for interpretation of the applicability of said Wage Order. [10] The NWPC referred petitioner's inquiry to the RTWPB.\n\nIn a letter-reply dated August 12, 1996, the RTWPB clarified that the Wage Order covers all private establishments situated in Region II, regardless of the voluntary adoption by said establishments of the wage orders established in Metro Manila and irrespective of the amounts already paid by the petitioner. [11]\n\nOn October 15, 1996, the petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the CA seeking nullification of the Wage Order on grounds that the RTWPB acted without authority when it issued the questioned Wage Order; that even assuming that the RTWPB was vested with the authority to prescribe an increase, it exceeded its authority when it did so without any ceiling or qualification; that the implementation of the Wage Order will cause the petitioner, and other similarly situated employers, to incur huge financial losses and suffer labor unrest. [12]\n\nOn March 24, 1997, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Manifestation and Motion in lieu of Comment affirming the petitioner's claim that the RTWPB acted beyond its authority in issuing the Wage Order prescribing an across-the-board increase to all workers and employees in Region II, effectively granting additional or other benefits not contemplated by R.A. No. 6727. [13]\n\nIn view of the OSG's manifestation, the CA directed respondents NWPC and RTWPB to file their comment. [14]\n\nOn September 22, 1997, respondents filed their Comment praying that the petition should be dismissed outright for petitioner's procedural lapses; that certiorari and prohibition are unavailing since petitioner failed to avail of the remedy of appeal prescribed by the Wage Order; that the Wage Order has long been in effect; and that the issuance of the Wage Order was performed in the exercise of a purely administrative function. [15]\n\nOn July 19, 2000, the CA rendered its Decision denying the petition.\u00a0 \u00a0The appellate court held that a writ of prohibition can no longer be issued since implementation of the Wage Order had long become fait accompli , the Wage Order having taken effect on January 1, 1996 and its implementing rules approved on February 14, 1996; that a writ of certiorari is improper since the Wage Order was issued in the exercise of a purely administrative function, not judicial or quasi-judicial; that the letter-query did not present justiciable controversies ripe for consideration by the respondents in the exercise of their wage-fixing function, since no appeal from the Wage Order was filed; that petitioner never brought before the said bodies any formal and definite challenge to the Wage Order and it cannot pass off the letter-queries as actual applications for relief; that even if petitioner's procedural lapse is disregarded, a regional wage order prescribing a wage increase across-the-board applies to banks adopting a unified wage system and a disparity in wages between employees holding similar positions in different regions is not wage distortion. [16]\n\nHence, the present petition anchored on the following grounds:\n4.1 THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN REFUSING TO DECLARE WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 NULL AND VOID AND OF NO LEGAL EFFECT.\n4.1.1 THE BOARD, IN ISSUING WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03, EXCEEDED THE AUTHORITY DELEGATED TO IT BY CONGRESS.\n\n4.1.2 WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 IS AN UNREASONABLE INTRUSION INTO THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PETITIONER.\n\n4.1.3 WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 UNDERMINES THE VERY ESSENCE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.\n\n4.1.4 WAGE ORDER NO. R02-03 FAILS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VERY RATIONALE FOR A UNIFIED WAGE STRUCTURE. 4.2 PETITIONER'S RECOURSE TO A WRIT OF CERTIORARI AND PROHIBITION WAS PROPER. [17] Following the submission of the Comment [18] and Reply [19] thereto, the Court gave due course to the petition and required both parties to submit their respective memoranda. [20] In compliance therewith, petitioner and respondents submitted their respective memoranda. [21]\n\nPetitioner poses two issues for resolution, to wit: (1) whether Wage Order No. R02-03 is void and of no legal effect; and (2) whether petitioner's recourse to a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the CA was proper.\n\nAnent the first issue, petitioner maintains that the RTWPB, in issuing said Wage Order, exceeded the authority delegated to it under R.A. No. 6727, which is limited to determining and fixing the minimum wage rate within their respective territorial jurisdiction and with respect only to employees who do not earn the prescribed minimum wage rate; that the RTWPB is not authorized to grant a general across-the-board wage increase for non-minimum wage earners; that Employers Confederation of the Philippines v. National Wages and Productivity Commission [22] (hereafter referred to as \"ECOP\" ) is not authority to rule that respondents have been empowered to fix wages other than the minimum wage since said case dealt with an across-the-board increase with a salary ceiling, where the wage adjustment is applied to employees receiving a certain denominated salary ceiling; that the Wage Order is an unreasonable intrusion into its property rights; that the Wage Order undermines the essence of collective bargaining; that the Wage Order fails to take into account the rationale for a unified wage structure.\n\nAs to the second issue, petitioner submits that ultra vires acts of administrative agencies are correctible by way of a writ of certiorari and prohibition; that even assuming that it did not observe the proper remedial procedure in challenging the Wage Order, the remedy of certiorari and prohibition remains available to it by way of an exception, on grounds of justice and equity; that its failure to observe procedural rules could not have validated the manner by which the disputed Wage Order was issued.\n\nRespondents counter that the present petition is fatally defective from inception since no appeal from the Wage Order was filed by petitioner; that the letter-query to the NWPC did not constitute the appeal contemplated by law; that the validity of the Wage Order was never raised before the respondents; that the implementation of the Wage Order had long become fait accompli for prohibition to prosper. \u00a0Respondents insist that, even if petitioner's procedural lapses are disregarded, the Wage Order was issued pursuant to the mandate of R.A. No. 6727 and in accordance with the Court's pronouncements in the ECOP case; [23] that the Wage Order is not an intrusion on property rights since it was issued after the required public hearings; that the Wage Order does not undermine but in fact recognizes the right to collective bargaining; that the Wage Order did not result in wage distortion.\n\nThe Court shall first dispose of the procedural matter relating to the propriety of petitioner's recourse to the CA before proceeding with the substantive issue involving the validity of the Wage Order.\n\nCertiorari as a special civil action is available only if the following essential requisites concur:\u00a0 (1) it must be directed against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) the tribunal, board, or officer must have acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. [24]\n\nOn the other hand, prohibition as a special civil action is available only if the following essential requisites concur:\u00a0 (1) it must be directed against a tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person exercising functions, judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial; (2) the tribunal, corporation, board or person has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. [25]\n\nA respondent is said to be exercising judicial function where he has the power to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties. [26] Quasi-judicial function is a term which applies to the action, discretion, etc. , of public administrative officers or bodies, who are required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature. [27] Ministerial function is one which an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard to the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. [28]\n\nIn the issuance of the assailed Wage Order, respondent RTWPB did not act in any judicial, quasi-judicial capacity, or ministerial capacity. \u00a0It was in the nature of subordinate legislation, promulgated by it in the exercise of delegated power under R.A. No. 6727. It was issued in the exercise of quasi-legislative power. Quasi-legislative or rule-making power is exercised by administrative agencies through the promulgation of rules and regulations within the confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non-delegation of certain powers flowing from the separation of the great branches of the government. [29]\n\nMoreover, the rule on the special civil actions of certiorari and prohibition equally mandate that these extra-ordinary remedies are available only when \"there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\"\u00a0 A remedy is considered plain, speedy and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment or rule, order or resolution of the lower court or agency. [30]\n\nSection 13 of the assailed Wage Order explicitly provides that any party aggrieved by the Wage Order may file an appeal with the NWPC through the RTWPB within 10 days from the publication of the wage order. [31] The Wage Order was published in a newspaper of general circulation on December 2, 1995. [32]\n\nIn this case, petitioner did not avail of the remedy provided by law.\u00a0 No appeal to the NWPC was filed by the petitioner within 10 calendar days from publication of the Wage Order on December 2, 1995.\u00a0 Petitioner was silent until seven months later, when it filed a letter-inquiry on July 24, 1996 with the NWPC seeking a clarification on the application of the Wage Order. Evidently, the letter-inquiry is not an appeal.\n\nIt must also be noted that the NWPC only referred petitioner's letter-inquiry to the RTWPB.\u00a0 Petitioner did not appeal the letter-reply dated August 12, 1996 of the RTWPB to the NWPC.\u00a0 No direct action was taken by the NWPC on the issuance or implementation of the Wage Order. Petitioner failed to invoke the power of the NWPC to review regional wage levels set by the RTWPB to determine if these are in accordance with prescribed guidelines. Thus, not only was it improper to implead the NWPC as party-respondent in the petition before the CA and this Court, but also petitioner failed to avail of the primary jurisdiction of the NWPC under Article 121 of the Labor Code, to wit:\nART. 121. Powers and Functions of the Commission. - The Commission shall have the following powers and functions:\n\nx x x x\n\n(d) To review regional wage levels set by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards to determine if these are in accordance with prescribed guidelines and national development plans;\n\nx x x x\n\n(f)\u00a0 To review plans and programs of the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards to determine whether these are consistent with national development plans;\n\n(g) To exercise technical and administrative supervision over the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards;\n\nx x x x\n(Emphasis supplied) Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, courts cannot and will not resolve a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal, especially where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact. [33]\n\nNevertheless, the Court will proceed to resolve the substantial issues in the present petition pursuant to the well-accepted principle that \u00a0acceptance of a petition for certiorari or prohibition as well as the grant of due course thereto is addressed to the sound discretion of the court. [34] It is a well-entrenched principle that rules of procedure are not inflexible tools designed to hinder or delay, but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate, rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed. [35]\n\nAs to respondents' submission that the implementation of the Wage Order can no longer be restrained since it has become fait accompli , the Wage Order having taken effect on January 1, 1996 and its implementing rules approved on February 14, 1996, suffice it to state that courts will decide a question otherwise moot if it is capable of repetition yet evading review. [36] Besides, a case becomes moot and academic only when there is no more actual controversy between the parties or no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits.\u00a0 Such circumstances do not obtain in the present case.\u00a0 The implementation of the Wage Order does not in any way render the case moot and academic, since the issue of the validity of the wage order subsists even after its implementation and which has to be determined and passed upon to resolve petitioner's rights and consequent obligations therein.\n\nIt is worthy to quote the Court's pronouncements in Tan v. Commission on Elections, [37] thus:\nFor this Honorable Court to yield to the respondents' urging that, as there has been fait accompli , then this Honorable Court should passively accept and accede to the prevailing situation is an unacceptable suggestion.\u00a0 Dismissal of the instant petition, as respondents so propose is a proposition fraught with mischief.\u00a0 Respondents' submission will create a dangerous precedent.\u00a0 Should this Honorable Court decline now to\u00a0 perform its duty of interpreting and indicating what the law is and should be, this might tempt again those who strut about in the corridors of power to recklessly and with ulterior motives commit illegal acts, either brazenly or stealthily, confident that this Honorable Court will abstain from entertaining future challenges to their acts if they manage to bring about a fait accompli . [38] Having disposed of this procedural issue, the Court now comes to the substance of the petition.\n\nR.A. No. 6727 declared it a policy of the State to rationalize the fixing of minimum wages and to promote productivity-improvement and gain-sharing measures to ensure a decent standard of living for the workers and their families; to guarantee the rights of labor to its just share in the fruits of production; to enhance employment generation in the countryside through industrial dispersal; and to allow business and industry reasonable returns on investment, expansion and growth. [39]\n\nIn line with its declared policy, R.A. No. 6727 [40] created the NWPC, [41] vested with the power to prescribe rules and guidelines for the determination of appropriate minimum wage and productivity measures at the regional, provincial or industry levels; [42] and authorized the RTWPB to determine and fix the minimum wage rates applicable in their respective regions, provinces, or industries therein and issue the corresponding wage orders, subject to the guidelines issued by the NWPC. [43] Pursuant to its wage fixing authority, the RTWPB may issue wage orders which set the daily minimum wage rates, [44] based on the standards or criteria set by Article 124 [45] of the Labor Code.\n\nIn ECOP , [46] the Court declared that there are two ways of fixing the minimum wage: the \"floor-wage\" method and the \"salary-ceiling\" method.\u00a0 The \"floor-wage\" method involves the fixing of a determinate amount to be added to the prevailing statutory minimum wage rates.\u00a0 On the other hand, in the \"salary-ceiling\" method, the wage adjustment was to be applied to employees receiving a certain denominated salary ceiling.\u00a0 In other words, workers already being paid more than the existing minimum wage (up to a certain amount stated in the Wage Order) are also to be given a wage increase. [47]\n\nTo illustrate: under the \"floor wage method\", it would have been sufficient if the Wage Order simply set P15.00 as the amount to be added to the prevailing statutory minimum wage rates, while in the \"salary-ceiling method\", it would have been sufficient if the Wage Order states a specific salary, such as P250.00, and only those earning below it shall be entitled to the salary increase.\n\nIn the present case, the RTWPB did not determine or fix the minimum wage rate by the \"floor-wage method\" or the \"salary-ceiling method\" in issuing the Wage Order. \u00a0The RTWPB did not set a wage level nor a range to which a wage adjustment or increase shall be added.\u00a0 Instead, it granted an across-the-board wage increase of P15.00 to all employees and workers of Region 2.\u00a0 In doing so, the RTWPB exceeded its authority by extending the coverage of the Wage Order to wage earners receiving more than the prevailing minimum wage rate, without a denominated salary ceiling. \u00a0As correctly pointed out by the OSG, the Wage Order granted additional benefits not contemplated by R.A. No. 6727.\n\nIn no uncertain terms must it be stressed that the function of promulgating rules and regulations may be legitimately exercised only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of a law. The power of administrative agencies is confined to implementing the law or putting it into effect. Corollary to this guideline is that administrative regulation cannot extend the law and amend a legislative enactment. [48] It is axiomatic that the clear letter of the law is controlling and cannot be amended by a mere administrative rule issued for its implementation. [49] Indeed, administrative or executive acts, orders, and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the laws or the Constitution. [50]\n\nWhere the legislature has delegated to an executive or administrative officers and boards authority to promulgate rules to carry out an express legislative purpose, the rules of administrative officers and boards, which have the effect of extending, or which conflict with the authority-granting statute, do not represent a valid exercise of the rule-making power but constitute an attempt by an administrative body to legislate. [51]\n\nIt has been said that when the application of an administrative issuance modifies existing laws or exceeds the intended scope, as in this case, the issuance becomes void, not only for being ultra vires , but also for being unreasonable. [52]\n\nThus, the Court finds that Section 1, Wage Order No. R02-03 is void insofar as it grants a wage increase to employees earning more than the minimum wage rate;\u00a0 and pursuant to the separability clause [53] of the Wage Order, Section 1 is declared valid with respect to employees earning the prevailing minimum wage rate.\n\nPrior to the passage of the Wage Order, the daily minimum wage rates in Region II was set at P104.00 for the Province of Isabela, P103.00 for the Province of Cagayan, P101.00 for the Province of Nueva Vizcaya, and P100.00 for the Provinces of Quirino and Batanes. [54] Only employees earning the above-stated minimum wage rates are entitled to the P15.00 mandated increase under the Wage Order.\n\nAlthough the concomitant effect of the nullity of the Wage Order to those employees who have received the mandated increase was not put in issue, this Court shall make a definite pronouncement thereon to finally put this case to rest.\u00a0 As ruled by the Court in Latchme Motoomull v. Dela Paz, [55] \"the Court will always strive to settle the entire controversy in a single proceeding leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation.\" [56]\n\nApplying by analogy, the Court's recent pronouncement in Philippine Ports Authority v. Commission on Audit, [57] thus:\nIn regard to the refund of\u00a0 the disallowed benefits, this Court\u00a0 holds that petitioners\u00a0 need not refund the benefits received by them based on our rulings in Blaquera v. Alcala, De Jesus v. Commission on Audit and Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Government Service Insurance System (KMG) v. Commission on Audit .\n\nIn Blaquera , the petitioners, who were officials and employees of several government departments and agencies, were paid incentive benefits pursuant to EO No. 292 and the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO No. 292.\u00a0 On January 3, 1993, then President Fidel V. Ramos issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 29 authorizing the grant of productivity incentive benefits for the year 1992 in the maximum amount of P1,000. Section 4 of AO No. 29 directed all departments, offices and agencies which authorized payment of CY 1992 Productivity Incentive Bonus in excess of P1,000\u00a0 to immediately cause the refund of the excess.\u00a0 Respondent heads of the departments or agencies of the government concerned caused the deduction from petitioners' salaries or allowances of the amounts needed to cover the overpayments.\u00a0 Petitioners therein filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before this Court to prevent respondents therein from making further deductions from their salaries or allowances.\u00a0 The Court ruled against the refund, thus:\nConsidering, however, that all the parties here acted in good faith, we cannot countenance the refund of subject incentive benefits for the year 1992, which amounts the petitioners have already received.\u00a0 Indeed, no indicia of bad faith can be detected under the attendant facts and circumstances.\u00a0 The officials and chiefs of offices concerned disbursed such incentive benefits in the honest belief that the amounts given were due to the recipients and the latter accepted the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits. The said ruling in Blaquera was applied in De Jesus .\n\nIn De Jesus, COA disallowed the payment of allowances and bonuses consisting of representation and transportation allowance, rice allowance, productivity incentive bonus, anniversary bonus, year-end bonus and cash gifts to members of the interim Board of Directors of the Catbalogan Water District. This Court affirmed the disallowance because petitioners therein were not entitled to other compensation except for payment of per diem under PD No. 198. However, the Court ruled against the refund of the allowances and bonuses received by petitioners, thus:\nThis ruling in Blaquera applies to the instant case. Petitioners here received the additional allowances and bonuses in good faith under the honest belief that LWUA Board Resolution No. 313 authorized such payment.\u00a0 At the time petitioners received the additional allowances and bonuses, the Court had not yet decided Baybay Water District .\u00a0 Petitioners had no knowledge that such payment was without legal basis.\u00a0 Thus, being in good faith, petitioners need not refund the allowances and bonuses they received but disallowed by the COA. Further, in KMG , this Court applied the ruling in Blaquera and De Jesus in holding that the Social Insurance Group (SIG) personnel of the Government Service Insurance System need not refund the hazard pay received by them although said benefit was correctly disallowed by COA.\u00a0 The Court ruled:\nThe Court however finds that the DOH and GSIS officials concerned who granted hazard pay under R.A. No. 7305 to the SIG personnel acted in good faith, in the honest belief that there was legal basis for such grant.\u00a0 The SIG personnel in turn accepted the hazard pay benefits likewise believing that they were entitled to such benefit.\u00a0 At that time, neither the concerned DOH and GSIS officials nor the SIG personnel knew that the grant of hazard pay to the latter is not sanctioned by law.\u00a0 Thus, following the rulings of the Court in De Jesus v. Commission on Audit , and Blaquera v. Alcala , the SIG personnel who previously received hazard pay under R.A. No. 7305 need not refund such benefits. In the same vein, the rulings in Blaquera, De Jesus and KMG apply to this case. Petitioners received the hazard duty pay and birthday cash gift in good faith since the benefits were authorized by PPA Special Order No. 407-97 issued pursuant to PPA Memorandum Circular No. 34-95 implementing DBM National Compensation Circular No. 76, series of 1995, and PPA Memorandum Circular No. 22-97, respectively.\u00a0 Petitioners at that time had no knowledge that the payment of said benefits lacked legal basis.\u00a0 Being in good faith, petitioners need not refund the benefits they received. [58] (Emphasis supplied) employees, other than minimum wage earners, who received the wage increase mandated by the Wage Order need not refund the wage increase received by them since they received the wage increase in good faith, in the honest belief that they are entitled to such wage increase and without any knowledge that there was no legal basis for the same.\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Court need not delve on the other arguments raised by the parties.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED . The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated July 19, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 42240 is MODIFIED .\u00a0 Section 1 of Wage Order No. R02-03 issued on October 17, 1995 by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board for Region II, Tuguegarao, Cagayan is declared VALID insofar as the mandated increase applies to employees earning the prevailing minimum wage rate at the time of the passage of the Wage Order and VOID with respect to its application to employees receiving more than the prevailing minimum wage rate at the time of the passage of the Wage Order.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Godardo A.

      "title": "Such delegation confers upon the President quasi-legislative power which may be defined as the authority delegated by the law-making body to the administrative body to adopt rules and regulations intended to carry out the provisions of the law and implement legislative policy.[17] To be valid, an administrative issuance, such as an executive order, must comply with the following requisites:(1) Its promulgation must be authorized by the legislature;(2) It must be promulgated in accordance with the prescribed procedure; (3) It must be within the scope of the authority given by the legislature; and (4) It must be reasonable.[18] Contrary to the conclusion of the Court of Appeals, EO 156 actually satisfied the first requisite of a valid administrative order. It has both constitutional and statutory bases. Delegation of legislative powers to the President is permitted in Section 28(2) of Article VI of the Constitution. It provides:(2) The Congress may, by law, authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government.[19] (Emphasis supplied)The relevant statutes to execute this provision are: 1) The Tariff and Customs Code which authorizes the President, in the interest of national economy, general welfare and/or national security, to, inter alia, prohibit the importation of any commodity. Section 401 thereof, reads:Sec. 401. Flexible Clause. \u2014 a. In the interest of national economy, general welfare and/or national security, and subject to the limitations herein prescribed, the President, upon recommendation of the National Economic and Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as NEDA), is hereby empowered: x x x (2) to establish import quota or to ban imports of any commodity, as may be necessary; x x x Provided, That upon periodic investigations by the Tariff Commission and recommendation of the NEDA, the President may cause a gradual reduction of protection levels granted in Section One hundred and four of this Code, including those subsequently granted pursuant to this section. (Emphasis supplied)2) Executive Order No. 226, the Omnibus Investment Code of the Philippines which was issued on July 16, 1987, by then President Corazon C. Aquino, in the exercise of legislative power under the Provisional Freedom Constitution,[20] empowers the President to approve or reject the prohibition on the importation of any equipment or raw materials or finished products. Pertinent provisions thereof, read:ART. 4. Composition of the board. The Board of Investments shall be composed of seven (7) governors: The Secretary of Trade and Industry, three (3) Undersecretaries of Trade and Industry to be chosen by the President; and three (3) representatives from the government agencies and the private sector x x x.ART. 7. Powers and duties of the Board. x x x x (12) Formulate and implement rationalization programs for certain industries whose operation may result in dislocation, overcrowding or inefficient use of resources, thus impeding economic growth. For this purpose, the Board may formulate guidelines for progressive manufacturing programs, local content programs, mandatory sourcing requirements and dispersal of industries. In appropriate cases and upon approval of the President, the Board may restrict, either totally or partially, the importation of any equipment or raw materials or finished products involved in the rationalization program; (Emphasis supplied)3) Republic Act No. 8800, otherwise known as the \u201cSafeguard Measures Act\u201d (SMA), and entitled \u201cAn Act Protecting Local Industries By Providing Safeguard Measures To Be Undertaken In Response To Increased Imports And Providing Penalties For Violation Thereof,\u201d[21] designated the Secretaries[22] of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Agriculture, in their capacity as alter egos of the President, as the implementing authorities of the safeguard measures, which include, inter alia, modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of a product into the Philippines. The purpose of the SMA is stated in the declaration of policy, thus:SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy. \u2013 The State shall promote competitiveness of domestic industries and producers based on sound industrial and agricultural development policies, and efficient use of human, natural and technical resources. In pursuit of this goal and in the public interest, the State shall provide safeguard measures to protect domestic industries and producers from increased imports which cause or threaten to cause serious injury to those domestic industries and producers.There are thus explicit constitutional and statutory permission authorizing the President to ban or regulate importation of articles and commodities into the country. Anent the second requisite, that is, that the order must be issued or promulgated in accordance with the prescribed procedure, it is necessary that the nature of the administrative issuance is properly determined. As in the enactment of laws, the general rule is that, the promulgation of administrative issuances requires previous notice and hearing, the only exception being where the legislature itself requires it and mandates that the regulation shall be based on certain facts as determined at an appropriate investigation.[23] This exception pertains to the issuance of legislative rules as distinguished from interpretative rules which give no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed;[24] and are designed merely to provide guidelines to the law which the administrative agency is in charge of enforcing.[25] A legislative rule, on the other hand, is in the nature of subordinate legislation, crafted to implement a primary legislation. In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Appeals,[26] and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc.,[27] the Court enunciated the doctrine that when an administrative rule goes beyond merely providing for the means that can facilitate or render less cumbersome the implementation of the law and substantially increases the burden of those governed, it behooves the agency to accord at least to those directly affected a chance to be heard and, thereafter, to be duly informed, before the issuance is given the force and effect of law. In the instant case, EO 156 is obviously a legislative rule as it seeks to implement or execute primary legislative enactments intended to protect the domestic industry by imposing a ban on the importation of a specified product not previously subject to such prohibition. The due process requirements in the issuance thereof are embodied in Section 401[28] of the Tariff and Customs Code and Sections 5 and 9 of the SMA[29] which essentially mandate the conduct of investigation and public hearings before the regulatory measure or importation ban may be issued.In the present case, respondents neither questioned before this Court nor with the courts below the procedure that paved the way for the issuance of EO 156. What they challenged in their petitions before the trial court was the absence of \u201csubstantive due process\u201d in the issuance of the EO.[30] Their main contention before the court a quo is that the importation ban is illogical and unfair because it unreasonably drives them out of business to the prejudice of the national economy.Considering the settled principle that in the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, acts of the other branches of the government are presumed to be valid,[31] and there being no objection from the respondents as to the procedure in the promulgation of EO 156, the presumption is that said executive issuance duly complied with the procedures and limitations imposed by law.To determine whether EO 156 has complied with the third and fourth requisites of a valid administrative issuance, to wit, that it was issued within the scope of authority given by the legislature and that it is reasonable, an examination of the nature of a Freeport under RA 7227 and the primordial purpose of the importation ban under the questioned EO is necessary.RA 7227 was enacted providing for, among other things, the sound and balanced conversion of the Clark and Subic military reservations and their extensions into alternative productive uses in the form of Special Economic and Freeport Zone, or the Subic Bay Freeport, in order to promote the economic and social development of Central Luzon in particular and the country in general. The Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7227 specifically defines the territory comprising the Subic Bay Freeport, referred to as the Special Economic and Freeport Zone in Section 12 of RA 7227 as \"a separate customs territory consisting of the City of Olongapo and the Municipality of Subic, Province of Zambales, the lands occupied by the Subic Naval Base and its contiguous extensions as embraced, covered and defined by the 1947 Philippine-U.S. Military Base Agreement as amended and within the territorial jurisdiction of Morong and Hermosa, Province of Bataan, the metes and bounds of which shall be delineated by the President of the Philippines; provided further that pending establishment of secure perimeters around the entire SBF, the SBF shall refer to the area demarcated by the SBMA pursuant to Section 13[32] hereof.\"Among the salient provisions of RA 7227 are as follows: SECTION 12. Subic Special Economic Zone. \u2014 x x x x The abovementioned zone shall be subject to the following policies: x x x x(a) Within the framework and subject to the mandate and limitations of the Constitution and the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code, the Subic Special Economic Zone shall be developed into a self-sustaining, industrial, commercial, financial and investment center to generate employment opportunities in and around the zone and to attract and promote productive foreign investments; (b) The Subic Special Economic Zone shall be operated and managed as a separate customs territory ensuring free flow or movement of goods and capital within, into and exported out of the Subic Special Economic Zone, as well as provide incentives such as tax and duty-free importations of raw materials, capital and equipment. However, exportation or removal of goods from the territory of the Subic Special Economic Zone to the other parts of the Philippine territory shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under the Customs and Tariff Code and other relevant tax laws of the Philippines;The Freeport was designed to ensure free flow or movement of goods and capital within a portion of the Philippine territory in order to attract investors to invest their capital in a business climate with the least governmental intervention. The concept of this zone was explained by Senator Guingona in this wise:Senator Guingona. Mr. President, the special economic zone is successful in many places, particularly Hong Kong, which is a free port. The difference between a special economic zone and an industrial estate is simply expansive in the sense that the commercial activities, including the establishment of banks, services, financial institutions, agro-industrial activities, maybe agriculture to a certain extent.This delineates the activities that would have the least of government intervention, and the running of the affairs of the special economic zone would be run principally by the investors themselves, similar to a housing subdivision, where the subdivision owners elect their representatives to run the affairs of the subdivision, to set the policies, to set the guidelines.We would like to see Subic area converted into a little Hong Kong, Mr. President, where there is a hub of free port and free entry, free duties and activities to a maximum spur generation of investment and jobs.While the investor is reluctant to come in the Philippines, as a rule, because of red tape and perceived delays, we envision this special economic zone to be an area where there will be minimum government interference.The initial outlay may not only come from the Government or the Authority as envisioned here, but from them themselves, because they would be encouraged to invest not only for the land but also for the buildings and factories. As long as they are convinced that in such an area they can do business and reap reasonable profits, then many from other parts, both local and foreign, would invest, Mr. President.[33] (Emphasis, added)With minimum interference from the government, investors can, in general, engage in any kind of business as well as import and export any article into and out of the Freeport. These are among the rights accorded to Subic Bay Freeport Enterprises under Section 39 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7227, thus \u2013SEC. 39. Rights and Obligations.- SBF Enterprises shall have the following rights and obligations:a. To freely engage in any business, trade, manufacturing, financial or service activity, and to import and export freely all types of goods into and out of the SBF, subject to the provisions of the Act, these Rules and other regulations that may be promulgated by the SBMA;Citing, inter alia, the interpellations of Senator Enrile, petitioners claim that the \u201cfree flow or movement of goods and capital\u201d only means that goods and material brought within the Freeport shall not be subject to customs duties and other taxes and should not be construed as an open floodgate for entry of all kinds of goods. They thus surmise that the importation ban on motor vehicles is applicable within the Freeport. Pertinent interpellations of Senator Enrile on the concept of Freeport is as follows:Senator Enrile: Mr. President, I think we are talking here of sovereign concepts, not territorial concepts. The concept that we are supposed to craft here is to carve out a portion of our terrestrial domain as well as our adjacent waters and say to the world: \u201cWell, you can set up your factories in this area that we are circumscribing, and bringing your equipment and bringing your goods, you are not subject to any taxes and duties because you are not within the customs jurisdiction of the Republic of the Philippines, whether you store the goods or only for purposes of transshipment or whether you make them into finished products again to be reexported to other lands.\u201dx x x xMy understanding of a \u201cfree port\u201d is, we are in effect carving out a part of our territory and make it as if it were foreign territory for purposes of our customs laws, and that people can come, bring their goods, store them there and bring them out again, as long as they do not come into the domestic commerce of the Republic.We do not really care whether these goods are stored here. The only thing that we care is for our people to have an employment because of the entry of these goods that are being discharged, warehoused and reloaded into the ships so that they can be exported. That will generate employment for us. For as long as that is done, we are saying, in effect, that we have the least contact with our tariff and customs laws and our tax laws. Therefore, we consider these goods as outside of the customs jurisdiction of the Republic of the Philippines as yet, until we draw them from this territory and bring them inside our domestic commerce. In which case, they have to pass through our customs gate. I thought we are carving out this entire area and convert it into this kind of concept.[34]However, contrary to the claim of petitioners, there is nothing in the foregoing excerpts which absolutely limits the incentive to Freeport investors only to exemption from customs duties and taxes. Mindful of the legislative intent to attract investors, enhance investment and boost the economy, the legislature could not have limited the enticement only to exemption from taxes. The minimum interference policy of the government on the Freeport extends to the kind of business that investors may embark on and the articles which they may import or export into and out of the zone. A contrary interpretation would defeat the very purpose of the Freeport and drive away investors.It does not mean, however, that the right of Freeport enterprises to import all types of goods and article is absolute. Such right is of course subject to the limitation that articles absolutely prohibited by law cannot be imported into the Freeport.[35] Nevertheless, in determining whether the prohibition would apply to the Freeport, resort to the purpose of the prohibition is necessary.In issuing EO 156, particularly the prohibition on importation under Article 2, Section 3.1, the President envisioned to rationalize the importation of used motor vehicles and to enhance the capabilities of the Philippine motor manufacturing firms to be globally competitive producers of completely build-up units and their parts and components for the local and export markets.[36] In justifying the issuance of EO 156, petitioners alleged that there has been a decline in the sales of new vehicles and a remarkable growth of the sales of imported used motor vehicles. To address the same, the President issued the questioned EO to prevent further erosion of the already depressed market base of the local motor vehicle industry and to curtail the harmful effects of the increase in the importation of used motor vehicles.[37] Taking our bearings from the foregoing discussions, we hold that the importation ban runs afoul the third requisite for a valid administrative order. To be valid, an administrative issuance must not be ultra vires or beyond the limits of the authority conferred. It must not supplant or modify the Constitution, its enabling statute and other existing laws, for such is the sole function of the legislature which the other branches of the government cannot usurp. As held in United BF Homeowner\u2019s Association v. BF Homes, Inc.:[38] The rule-making power of a public administrative body is a delegated legislative power, which it may not use either to abridge the authority given it by Congress or the Constitution or to enlarge its power beyond the scope intended. Constitutional and statutory provisions control what rules and regulations may be promulgated by such a body, as well as with respect to what fields are subject to regulation by it. It may not make rules and regulations which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or a statute, particularly the statute it is administering or which created it, or which are in derogation of, or defeat, the purpose of a statute.In the instant case, the subject matter of the laws authorizing the President to regulate or forbid importation of used motor vehicles, is the domestic industry. EO 156, however, exceeded the scope of its application by extending the prohibition on the importation of used cars to the Freeport, which RA 7227, considers to some extent, a foreign territory. The domestic industry which the EO seeks to protect is actually the \u201ccustoms territory\u201d which is defined under the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7227, as follows:\u201cthe portion of the Philippines outside the Subic Bay Freeport where the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines and other national tariff and customs laws are in force and effect.\u201d[39]The proscription in the importation of used motor vehicles should be operative only outside the Freeport and the inclusion of said zone within the ambit of the prohibition is an invalid modification of RA 7227. Indeed, when the application of an administrative issuance modifies existing laws or exceeds the intended scope, as in the instant case, the issuance becomes void, not only for being ultra vires, but also for being unreasonable.This brings us to the fourth requisite. It is an axiom in administrative law that administrative authorities should not act arbitrarily and capriciously in the issuance of rules and regulations. To be valid, such rules and regulations must be reasonable and fairly adapted to secure the end in view. If shown to bear no reasonable relation to the purposes for which they were authorized to be issued, then they must be held to be invalid.[40]There is no doubt that the issuance of the ban to protect the domestic industry is a reasonable exercise of police power. The deterioration of the local motor manufacturing firms due to the influx of imported used motor vehicles is an urgent national concern that needs to be swiftly addressed by the President. In the exercise of delegated police power, the executive can therefore validly proscribe the importation of these vehicles. Thus, in Taxicab Operators of Metro Manila, Inc. v. Board of Transportation,[41] the Court held that a regulation phasing out taxi cabs more than six years old is a valid exercise of police power. The regulation was sustained as reasonable holding that the purpose thereof was to promote the convenience and comfort and protect the safety of the passengers.The problem, however, lies with respect to the application of the importation ban to the Freeport. The Court finds no logic in the all encompassing application of the assailed provision to the Freeport which is outside the customs territory. As long as the used motor vehicles do not enter the customs territory, the injury or harm sought to be prevented or remedied will not arise. The application of the law should be consistent with the purpose of and reason for the law. Ratione cessat lex, et cessat lex. When the reason for the law ceases, the law ceases. It is not the letter alone but the spirit of the law also that gives it life.[42] To apply the proscription to the Freeport would not serve the purpose of the EO. Instead of improving the general economy of the country, the application of the importation ban in the Freeport would subvert the avowed purpose of RA 7227 which is to create a market that would draw investors and ultimately boost the national economy. In similar cases, we also declared void the administrative issuance or ordinances concerned for being unreasonable. To illustrate, in De la Cruz v. Paras,[43] the Court held as unreasonable and unconstitutional an ordinance characterized by overbreadth. In that case, the Municipality of Bocaue, Bulacan, prohibited the operation of all night clubs, cabarets and dance halls within its jurisdiction for the protection of public morals. As explained by the Court:x x x It cannot be said that such a sweeping exercise of a lawmaking power by Bocaue could qualify under the term reasonable. The objective of fostering public morals, a worthy and desirable end can be attained by a measure that does not encompass too wide a field. Certainly the ordinance on its face is characterized by overbreadth. The purpose sought to be achieved could have been attained by reasonable restrictions rather than by an absolute prohibition. The admonition in Salaveria should be heeded: \u201cThe Judiciary should not lightly set aside legislative action when there is not a clear invasion of personal or property rights under the guise of police regulation.\u201d It is clear that in the guise of a police regulation, there was in this instance a clear invasion of personal or property rights, personal in the case of those individuals desirous of patronizing those night clubs and property in terms of the investments made and salaries to be earned by those therein employed.Lupangco v. Court of Appeals,[44] is a case involving a resolution issued by the Professional Regulation Commission which prohibited examinees from attending review classes and receiving handout materials, tips, and the like three days before the date of examination in order to preserve the integrity and purity of the licensure examinations in accountancy. Besides being unreasonable on its face and violative of academic freedom, the measure was found to be more sweeping than what was necessary, viz: Needless to say, the enforcement of Resolution No. 105 is not a guarantee that the alleged leakages in the licensure examinations will be eradicated or at least minimized. Making the examinees suffer by depriving them of legitimate means of review or preparation on those last three precious days \u2014 when they should be refreshing themselves with all that they have learned in the review classes and preparing their mental and psychological make-up for the examination day itself \u2014 would be like uprooting the tree to get rid of a rotten branch. What is needed to be done by the respondent is to find out the source of such leakages and stop it right there. If corrupt officials or personnel should be terminated from their loss, then so be it. Fixers or swindlers should be flushed out. Strict guidelines to be observed by examiners should be set up and if violations are committed, then licenses should be suspended or revoked. x x xIn Lucena Grand Central Terminal, Inc. v. JAC Liner, Inc.,[45] the Court likewise struck down as unreasonable and overbreadth a city ordinance granting an exclusive franchise for 25 years, renewable for another 25 years, to one entity for the construction and operation of one common bus and jeepney terminal facility in Lucena City. While professedly aimed towards alleviating the traffic congestion alleged to have been caused by the existence of various bus and jeepney terminals within the city, the ordinance was held to be beyond what is reasonably necessary to solve the traffic problem in the city. By parity of reasoning, the importation ban in this case should also be declared void for its too sweeping and unnecessary application to the Freeport which has no bearing on the objective of the prohibition. If the aim of the EO is to prevent the entry of used motor vehicles from the Freeport to the customs territory, the solution is not to forbid entry of these vehicles into the Freeport, but to intensify governmental campaign and measures to thwart illegal ingress of used motor vehicles into the customs territory. At this juncture, it must be mentioned that on June 19, 1993, President Fidel V. Ramos issued Executive Order No. 97-A, \u201cFurther Clarifying The Tax And Duty-Free Privilege Within The Subic Special Economic And Free Port Zone,\u201d Section 1 of which provides: SECTION 1. The following guidelines shall govern the tax and duty-free privilege within the Secured Area of the Subic Special Economic and Free Port Zone: 1.1. The Secured Area consisting of the presently fenced-in former Subic Naval Base shall be the only completely tax and duty-free area in the SSEFPZ. Business enterprises and individuals (Filipinos and foreigners) residing within the Secured Area are free to import raw materials, capital goods, equipment, and consumer items tax and dutry-free. Consumption items, however, must be consumed within the Secured Area. Removal of raw materials, capital goods, equipment and consumer items out of the Secured Area for sale to non-SSEFPZ registered enterprises shall be subject to the usual taxes and duties, except as may be provided herein.In Tiu v. Court of Appeals[46] as reiterated in Coconut Oil Refiners Association, Inc. v. Torres,[47] this provision limiting the special privileges on tax and duty-free importation in the presently fenced-in former Subic Naval Base has been declared valid and constitutional and in accordance with RA 7227. Consistent with these rulings and for easier management and monitoring of activities and to prevent fraudulent importation of merchandise and smuggling, the free flow and importation of used motor vehicles shall be operative only within the \u201csecured area.\u201d In sum, the Court finds that Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156 is void insofar as it is made applicable to the presently secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area as stated in Section 1.1 of EO 97-A. Pursuant to the separability clause[48] of EO 156, Section 3.1 is declared valid insofar as it applies to the customs territory or the Philippine territory outside the presently secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area as stated in Section 1.1 of EO 97-A. Hence, used motor vehicles that come into the Philippine territory via the secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area may be stored, used or traded therein, or exported out of the Philippine territory, but they cannot be imported into the Philippine territory outside of the secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area. WHEREFORE, the petitions are PARTIALLY GRANTED and the May 24, 2004 Decisions of Branch 72, Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, in Civil Case No. 20-0-04 and Civil Case No. 22-0-04; and the February 14, 2005 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 63284, are MODIFIED insofar as they declared Article 2, Section 3.1 of Executive Order No. 156, void in its entirety.Said provision is declared VALID insofar as it applies to the Philippine territory outside the presently fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area and VOID with respect to its application to the secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area.

SP. No. 83284, which declared Article 2, Section 3.1 of Executive Order No. 156 (EO 156) unconstitutional.\u00a0 Said executive issuance prohibits the importation into the country, inclusive of the Special Economic and Freeport Zone or the Subic Bay Freeport (SBF or Freeport), of used motor vehicles, subject to a few exceptions.\n\nThe undisputed facts show that on December 12, 2002, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, through Executive Secretary Alberto G. Romulo, issued EO 156, entitled\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPROVIDING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND DIRECTIONS FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND ITS IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES.\u201d\u00a0 The challenged provision states:\n3.1 The importation into the country, inclusive of the Freeport, of all types of used motor vehicles is prohibited, except for the following:\n\n3.1.1 A vehicle that is owned and for the personal use of a returning resident or immigrant and covered by an authority to import issued under the No-dollar Importation Program.\u00a0 Such vehicles cannot be resold for at least three (3) years;\n\n3.1.2 A vehicle for the use of an official of the Diplomatic Corps and authorized to be imported by the Department of Foreign Affairs;\n\n3.1.3 Trucks excluding pickup trucks;\nwith GVW of 2.5-6.0 tons covered by an authority to import issued by the DTI. With GVW above 6.0 tons. 3.1.4 Buses:\nwith GVW of 6-12 tons covered by an authority to import issued by DTI; with GVW above 12 tons. 3.1.5 Special purpose vehicles:\nfire trucks ambulances funeral hearse/coaches crane lorries tractor heads and truck tractors boom trucks tanker trucks tank lorries with high pressure spray gun refers or refrigerated trucks mobile drilling derricks transit/concrete mixers mobile radiological units wreckers or tow trucks concrete pump trucks aerial/bucket flat-form trucks street sweepers vacuum trucks garbage compactors self loader trucks man lift trucks lighting trucks trucks mounted with special purpose equipment all other types of vehicle designed for a specific use. The issuance of EO 156 spawned three separate actions for declaratory relief before Branch 72 of the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, all seeking the declaration of the unconstitutionality of Article 2, Section 3.1 of said executive order.\u00a0 The cases were filed by herein respondent entities, who or whose members, are classified as Subic Bay Freeport Enterprises and engaged in the business of, among others, importing and/or trading used motor vehicles.\n\nG.R. No. 164171:\n\nOn January 16, 2004, respondents Southwing Heavy Industries, Inc., (Southwing) United Auctioneers, Inc. (United Auctioneers), and Microvan, Inc. (Microvan), instituted a declaratory relief case docketed as Civil Case No. 20-0-04, [1] against the Executive Secretary, Secretary of Transportation and Communication, Commissioner of Customs, Assistant Secretary and Head of the Land Transportation Office, Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), Collector of Customs for the Port at Subic Bay Freeport Zone, and the Chief of the Land Transportation Office at Subic Bay Freeport Zone.\n\nSOUTHWING, UNITED AUCTIONEERS and MICROVAN\u00a0\n\nprayed that judgment be rendered (1) declaring Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156 unconstitutional and illegal; (2) directing the Secretary of Finance, Commissioner of Customs, Collector of Customs and the Chairman of the SBMA to allow the importation of used motor vehicles; (2) ordering the Land Transportation Office and its subordinates inside the Subic Special Economic Zone to process the registration of the imported used motor vehicles; and (3) in general, to allow the unimpeded entry and importation of used motor vehicles subject only to the payment of the required customs duties. Upon filing of petitioners\u2019 answer/comment, respondents SOUTHWING and MICROVAN filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted by the trial court.\u00a0 On May 24, 2004, a summary judgment was rendered declaring that Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156 constitutes an unlawful usurpation of legislative power vested by the Constitution with Congress.\u00a0 The trial court further held that the proviso is contrary to the mandate of Republic Act No. 7227 (RA 7227) or the Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992 which allows the free flow of goods and capital within the Freeport.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the said decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of petitioner declaring Executive Order 156 [Article 2, Section] 3.1 for being unconstitutional and illegal; directing respondents Collector of Customs based at SBMA to allow the importation and entry of used motor vehicles pursuant to the mandate of RA 7227; directing respondent Chief\u00a0 of the Land Transportation Office and its subordinates inside the Subic Special Economic Zone or SBMA to process the registration of imported used motor vehicle; and in general, to allow unimpeded entry and importation of used motor vehicles to the Philippines subject only to the payment of the required customs duties.\n\nSO ORDERED. [2]\nFrom the foregoing decision, petitioners sought relief before this Court via a petition for review on certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 164171.\n\nG.R. No. 164172:\n\nOn January 20, 2004, respondent Subic Integrated Macro Ventures Corporation (MACRO VENTURES) filed with the same trial court, a similar action for declaratory relief docketed as Civil Case No. 22-0-04, [3] with the same prayer and against the same parties [4] as those in Civil Case No. 20-0-04.\n\nIn this case, the trial court likewise rendered a summary judgment on May 24, 2004, holding that Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156, is repugnant to the constitution. [5] Elevated to this Court via a petition for review on certiorari, Civil Case No. 22-0-04 was docketed as G.R. No. 164172.\n\nG.R. No. 168741\n\nOn January 22, 2003, respondent Motor Vehicle Importers Association of Subic Bay Freeport, Inc. (Association), filed another action for declaratory relief with essentially the same prayer as those in Civil Case No. 22-0-04 and Civil Case No. 20-0-04, against the Executive Secretary, Secretary of Finance, Chief of the Land Transportation Office, Commissioner of Customs, Collector of Customs at SBMA and the Chairman of SBMA.\u00a0 This was docketed as Civil Case No. 30-0-2003, [6] before the same trial court.\n\nIn a decision dated March 10, 2004, the court a quo granted the Association\u2019s prayer and declared the assailed proviso as contrary to the Constitution, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of petitioner declaring Executive Order 156 [Article 2, Section] 3.1 for being unconstitutional and illegal; directing respondents Collector of Customs based at SBMA to allow the importation and entry of used motor vehicles pursuant to the mandate of RA 7227; directing respondent Chief of the Land Transportation Office and its subordinates inside the Subic Special Economic Zone or SBMA to process the registration of imported used motor vehicles; directing the respondent Chairman of the SBMA to allow the entry into the Subic Special Economic Zone or SBMA imported used motor vehicle; and in general, to allow unimpeded entry and importation of used motor vehicles to the Philippines subject only to the payment of the required customs duties.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7] Aggrieved, the petitioners in Civil Case No. 30-0-2003, filed a petition for certiorari [8] with the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP. No. 83284) which denied the petition on February 14, 2005 and sustained the finding of the trial court that Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156, is void for being repugnant to the constitution.\u00a0 The dispositive portion thereof, reads:\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is hereby DENIED.\u00a0 The assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court, Third Judicial Region, Branch 72, Olongapo City, in Civil Case No. 30-0-2003, accordingly, STANDS.\n\nSO ORDERED. [9] The aforequoted decision of the Court of Appeals was elevated to this Court and docketed as G.R. No. 168741.\u00a0 In a Resolution dated October 4, 2005, [10] said case was consolidated with G.R. No. 164171 and G.R. No. 164172.\n\nPetitioners are now before this Court contending that Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156 is valid and applicable to the entire country, including the Freeeport.\u00a0 In support of their arguments, they raise procedural and substantive issues bearing on the constitutionality of the assailed proviso.\u00a0 The procedural issues are: the lack of respondents\u2019 locus standi to question the validity of EO 156, the propriety of challenging EO 156 in a declaratory relief proceeding and the applicability of a judgment on the pleadings in this case.\n\nPetitioners argue that respondents will not be affected by the importation ban considering that their certificate of registration and tax exemption do not authorize them to engage in the importation and/or trading of used cars .\u00a0 They also aver that the actions filed by respondents do not qualify as declaratory relief cases.\u00a0 Section 1, Rule 63 of the Rules of Court provides that a petition for declaratory relief may be filed before there is a breach or violation of rights.\u00a0 Petitioners claim that there was already a breach of respondents\u2019 supposed right because the cases were filed more than a year after the issuance of EO 156.\u00a0 In fact, in Civil Case No. 30-0-2003, numerous warrants of seizure and detention were issued against imported used motor vehicles belonging to respondent Association\u2019s members.\n\nPetitioners\u2019 arguments lack merit.\n\nThe established rule that the constitutionality of a law or administrative issuance can be challenged by one who will sustain a direct injury as a result of its enforcement [11] has been satisfied in the instant case.\u00a0\u00a0 The broad subject of the prohibited importation is \u201c all types of used motor vehicles .\u201d\u00a0 Respondents would definitely suffer a direct injury from the implementation of EO 156 because their certificate of registration and tax exemption authorize them to trade and/or import new and used motor vehicles and spare parts , except \u201cused cars.\u201d [12] Other types of motor vehicles imported and/or traded by respondents and not falling within the category of used cars would thus be subjected to the ban to the prejudice of their business. Undoubtedly, respondents have the legal standing to assail the validity of EO 156.\n\nAs to the propriety of declaratory relief as a vehicle for assailing the executive issuance, suffice it to state that any breach of the rights of respondents will not affect the case.\u00a0 In Commission on Audit of the Province of Cebu v. Province of Cebu , [13] the Court entertained a suit for declaratory relief to finally settle the doubt as to the proper interpretation of the conflicting laws involved, notwithstanding a violation of the right of the party affected.\u00a0 We find no reason to deviate from said ruling mindful of the significance of the present case to the national economy.\n\nSo also, summary judgments were properly rendered by the trial court because the issues involved in the instant case were pure questions of law.\u00a0 A motion for summary judgment is premised on the assumption that the issues presented need not be tried either because these are patently devoid of substance or that there is no genuine issue as to any pertinent fact.\u00a0 It is a method sanctioned by the Rules of Court for the prompt disposition of a civil action in which the pleadings raise only a legal issue, not a genuine issue as to any material fact. [14]\n\nAt any rate, even assuming the procedural flaws raised by petitioners truly exist, the Court is not precluded from brushing aside these technicalities and taking cognizance of the action filed by respondents considering its importance to the public and in keeping with the duty to determine whether the other branches of the government have kept themselves within the limits of the Constitution. [15]\n\nWe now come to the substantive issues , which are: (1) whether there is statutory basis for the issuance of EO 156; and (2) if the answer is in the affirmative, whether the application of Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156, reasonable and within the scope provided by law.\n\nThe main thrust of the petition is that EO 156 is constitutional because it was issued pursuant to EO 226, the Omnibus Investment Code of the Philippines and that its application should be extended to the Freeport because the guarantee of RA 7227 on the free flow of goods into the said zone is merely an exemption from customs duties and taxes on items brought into the Freeport and not an open floodgate for all kinds of goods and materials without restriction.\n\nIn G.R. No. 168741, the Court of Appeals invalidated Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156, on the ground of lack of any statutory basis for the President to issue the same.\u00a0 It held that the prohibition on the importation of used motor vehicles is an exercise of police power vested on the legislature and absent any enabling law, the exercise thereof by the President through an executive issuance, is void.\n\nPolice power is inherent in a government to enact laws, within constitutional limits, to promote the order, safety, health, morals, and general welfare of society.\u00a0 It is lodged primarily with the legislature.\u00a0 By virtue of a valid delegation of legislative power, it may also be exercised by the President and administrative boards, as well as the lawmaking bodies on all municipal levels, including the barangay. [16] Such delegation confers upon the President quasi-legislative power which may be defined as the authority delegated by the law-making body to the administrative body to adopt rules and regulations intended to carry out the provisions of the law and implement legislative policy. [17] To be valid, an administrative issuance, such as an executive order, must comply with the following requisites:\n\n(1) Its promulgation must be authorized by the legislature;\n(2) It must be promulgated in accordance with the prescribed procedure;\n(3) It must be within the scope of the authority given by the legislature; and\n(4) It must be reasonable. [18]\n\nContrary to the conclusion of the Court of Appeals, EO 156 actually satisfied the first requisite of a valid administrative order.\u00a0 It has both constitutional and statutory bases.\n\nDelegation of legislative powers to the President is permitted in Section 28(2) of Article VI of the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0 It provides:\n(2) The Congress may, by law , authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government. [19] (Emphasis supplied)\nThe relevant statutes to execute this provision are:\n\n1) The Tariff and Customs Code which authorizes the President, in the interest of national economy, general welfare and/or national security, to, inter alia , prohibit the importation of any commodity.\u00a0 Section 401 thereof, reads:\nSec. 401. Flexible Clause. \u2014\n\na. In the interest of national economy, general welfare and/or national security, and subject to the limitations herein prescribed, the President, upon recommendation of the National Economic and Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as NEDA), is hereby empowered: x x x (2) to establish import quota or to ban imports of any commodity, as may be necessary ; x x x Provided, That upon periodic investigations by the Tariff Commission and recommendation of the NEDA, the President may cause a gradual reduction of protection levels granted in Section One hundred and four of this Code, including those subsequently granted pursuant to this section.\u00a0 (Emphasis supplied)\n2) Executive Order No. 226, the Omnibus Investment Code of the Philippines which was issued on July 16, 1987, by then President Corazon C. Aquino, in the exercise of legislative power under the Provisional Freedom Constitution, [20] empowers the President to approve or reject the prohibition on the importation of any equipment or raw materials or finished products.\u00a0 Pertinent provisions thereof, read:\nART. 4. Composition of the board.\u00a0 The Board of Investments shall be composed of seven (7) governors: The Secretary of Trade and Industry, three (3) Undersecretaries of Trade and Industry to be chosen by the President; and three (3) representatives from the government agencies and the private sector x x x.\n\nART. 7.\u00a0 Powers and duties of the Board.\n\nx x x x\n\n(12) Formulate and implement rationalization programs for certain industries whose operation may result in dislocation, overcrowding or inefficient use of resources, thus impeding economic growth.\u00a0 For this purpose, the Board may formulate guidelines for progressive manufacturing programs, local content programs, mandatory sourcing requirements and dispersal of industries. In appropriate cases and upon approval of the President, the Board may restrict, either totally or partially, the importation of any equipment or raw materials or finished products involved in the rationalization program ; (Emphasis supplied)\n3) Republic Act No. 8800, otherwise known as the \u201cSafeguard Measures Act\u201d ( SMA ), and entitled \u201cAn Act Protecting Local Industries By Providing Safeguard Measures To Be Undertaken In Response To Increased Imports And Providing Penalties For Violation Thereof,\u201d [21] designated the Secretaries [22] of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Agriculture, in their capacity as alter egos of the President, as the implementing authorities of the safeguard measures, which include, inter alia, modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of a product into the Philippines.\u00a0 The purpose of the SMA is stated in the declaration of policy, thus:\nSEC. 2. Declaration of Policy. \u2013 The State shall promote competitiveness of domestic industries and producers based on sound industrial and agricultural development policies, and efficient use of human, natural and technical resources. In pursuit of this goal and in the public interest, the State shall provide safeguard measures to protect domestic industries and producers from increased imports which cause or threaten to cause serious injury to those domestic industries and producers.\nThere are thus explicit constitutional and statutory permission authorizing the President to ban or regulate importation of articles and commodities into the country.\n\nAnent the second requisite, that is, that the order must be issued or promulgated in accordance with the prescribed procedure, it is necessary that the nature of the administrative issuance is properly determined.\u00a0 As in the enactment of laws, the general rule is that, the promulgation of administrative issuances requires previous notice and hearing, the only exception being where the legislature itself requires it and mandates that the regulation shall be based on certain facts as determined at an appropriate investigation. [23] This exception pertains to the issuance of legislative rules as distinguished from interpretative rules which give no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed; [24] and are designed merely to provide guidelines to the law which the administrative agency is in charge of enforcing. [25] A legislative rule , on the other hand, is in the nature of subordinate legislation, crafted to implement a primary legislation.\n\nIn Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Appeals , [26] and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc ., [27] the Court enunciated the doctrine that when an administrative rule goes beyond merely providing for the means that can facilitate or render less cumbersome the implementation of the law and substantially increases the burden of those governed, it behooves the agency to accord at least to those directly affected a chance to be heard and, thereafter, to be duly informed, before the issuance is given the force and effect of law.\n\nIn the instant case, EO 156 is obviously a legislative rule as it seeks to implement or execute primary legislative enactments intended to protect the domestic industry by imposing a ban on the importation of a specified product not previously subject to such prohibition.\u00a0\u00a0 The due process requirements in the issuance thereof are embodied in Section 401 [28] of the Tariff and Customs Code and Sections 5 and 9 of the SMA [29] which essentially mandate the conduct of investigation and public hearings before the regulatory measure or importation ban may be issued.\n\nIn the present case, respondents neither questioned before this Court nor with the courts below the procedure that paved the way for the issuance of EO 156.\u00a0 What they challenged in their petitions before the trial court was the absence of \u201csubstantive due process\u201d in the issuance of the EO. [30] Their main contention before the court a quo is that the importation ban is illogical and unfair because it unreasonably drives them out of business to the prejudice of the national economy.\n\nConsidering the settled principle that in the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, acts of the other branches of the government are presumed to be valid, [31] and there being no objection from the respondents as to the procedure in the promulgation of EO 156, the presumption is that said executive issuance duly complied with the procedures and limitations imposed by law.\n\nTo determine whether EO 156 has complied with the third and fourth requisites of a valid administrative issuance, to wit, that it was issued within the scope of authority given by the legislature and that it is reasonable, an examination of the nature of a Freeport under RA 7227 and the primordial purpose of the importation ban under the questioned EO is necessary.\n\nRA 7227 was enacted providing for, among other things, the sound and balanced conversion of the Clark and Subic military reservations and their extensions into alternative productive uses in the form of Special Economic and Freeport Zone, or the Subic Bay Freeport, in order to promote the economic and social development of Central Luzon in particular and the country in general.\n\nThe Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7227 specifically defines the territory comprising the Subic Bay Freeport, referred to as the Special Economic and Freeport Zone in Section 12 of RA 7227 as \"a separate customs territory consisting of the City of Olongapo and the Municipality of Subic, Province of Zambales, the lands occupied by the Subic Naval Base and its contiguous extensions as embraced, covered and defined by the 1947 Philippine-U.S. Military Base Agreement as amended and within the territorial jurisdiction of Morong and\u00a0 Hermosa, Province of Bataan, the metes and bounds of which shall be delineated by the President of the Philippines; provided further that pending establishment of secure perimeters around the entire SBF, the SBF shall refer to the area demarcated by the SBMA pursuant to Section 13 [32] hereof.\"\n\nAmong the salient provisions of RA 7227 are as follows:\nSECTION 12. Subic Special Economic Zone. \u2014\n\nx x x x\n\nThe abovementioned zone shall be subject to the following policies:\n\nx x x x\n\n(a) Within the framework and subject to the mandate and limitations of the Constitution and the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code, the Subic Special Economic Zone shall be developed into a self-sustaining, industrial, commercial, financial and investment center to generate employment opportunities in and around the zone and to attract and promote productive foreign investments;\n\n(b) The Subic Special Economic Zone shall be operated and managed as a separate customs territory ensuring free flow or movement of goods and capital within, into and exported\u00a0 out of the Subic Special Economic Zone, as well as provide incentives such as tax and duty-free importations of raw materials, capital and equipment. However, exportation or removal of goods from the territory of the Subic Special Economic Zone to the other parts of the Philippine territory shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under the Customs and Tariff Code and other relevant tax laws of the Philippines;\nThe Freeport was designed to ensure free flow or movement of goods and capital within a portion of the Philippine territory in order to attract investors to invest their capital in a business climate with the least governmental intervention.\u00a0 The concept of this zone was explained by Senator Guingona in this wise:\nSenator Guingona.\u00a0 Mr. President, the special economic zone is successful in many places, particularly Hong Kong, which is a free port.\u00a0 The difference between a special economic zone and an industrial estate is simply expansive in the sense that the commercial activities, including the establishment of banks, services, financial institutions, agro-industrial activities, maybe agriculture to a certain extent.\n\nThis delineates the activities that would have the least of government intervention, and the running of the affairs of the special economic zone would be run principally by the investors themselves, similar to a housing subdivision, where the subdivision owners elect their representatives to run the affairs of the subdivision, to set the policies, to set the guidelines.\n\nWe would like to see Subic area converted into a little Hong Kong, Mr. President, where there is a hub of free port and free entry, free duties and activities to a maximum spur generation of investment and jobs.\n\nWhile the investor is reluctant to come in the Philippines, as a rule, because of red tape and perceived delays, we envision this special economic zone to be an area where there will be minimum government interference.\n\nThe initial outlay may not only come from the Government or the Authority as envisioned here, but from them themselves, because they would be encouraged to invest not only for the land but also for the buildings and factories.\u00a0 As long as they are convinced that in such an area they can do business and reap reasonable profits, then many from other parts, both local and foreign, would invest, Mr. President. [33] (Emphasis, added)\nWith minimum interference from the government, investors can, in general, engage in any kind of business as well as import and export any article into and out of the Freeport.\u00a0 These are among the rights accorded to Subic Bay Freeport Enterprises under Section 39 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7227, thus \u2013\nSEC. 39. Rights and Obligations.- SBF Enterprises shall have the following rights and obligations:\n\na. To freely engage in any business, trade, manufacturing, financial or service activity, and to import and export freely all types of goods into and out of the SBF, subject to the provisions of the Act, these Rules and other regulations that may be promulgated by the SBMA;\nCiting, inter alia , the interpellations of Senator Enrile, petitioners claim that the \u201cfree flow or movement of goods and capital\u201d only means that goods and material brought within the Freeport shall not be subject to customs duties and other taxes and should not be construed as an open floodgate for entry of all kinds of goods. They thus surmise that the importation ban on motor vehicles is applicable within the Freeport.\u00a0 Pertinent interpellations of Senator Enrile on the concept of Freeport is as follows:\nSenator Enrile: Mr. President, I think we are talking here of sovereign concepts, not territorial concepts.\u00a0 The concept that we are supposed to craft here is to carve out a portion of our terrestrial domain as well as our adjacent waters and say to the world: \u201cWell, you can set up your factories in this area that we are circumscribing, and bringing your equipment and bringing your goods, you are not subject to any taxes and duties because you are not within the customs jurisdiction of the Republic of the Philippines, whether you store the goods or only for purposes of transshipment or whether you make them into finished products again to be reexported to other lands.\u201d\n\nx x x x\n\nMy understanding of a \u201cfree port\u201d is, we are in effect carving out a part of our territory and make it as if it were foreign territory for purposes of our customs laws, and that people can come, bring their goods, store them there and bring them out again, as long as they do not come into the domestic commerce of the Republic.\n\nWe do not really care whether these goods are stored here.\u00a0 The only thing that we care is for our people to have an employment because of the entry of these goods that are being discharged, warehoused and reloaded into the ships so that they can be exported. That will generate employment for us.\u00a0 For as long as that is done, we are saying, in effect, that we have the least contact with our tariff and customs laws and our tax laws. Therefore, we consider these goods as outside of the customs jurisdiction of the Republic of the Philippines as yet, until we draw them from this territory and bring them inside our domestic commerce.\u00a0 In which case, they have to pass through our customs gate.\u00a0 I thought we are carving out this entire area and convert it into this kind of concept. [34]\nHowever, contrary to the claim of petitioners, there is nothing in the foregoing excerpts which absolutely limits the incentive to Freeport investors only to exemption from customs duties and taxes.\u00a0 Mindful of the legislative intent to attract investors, enhance investment and boost the economy, the legislature could not have limited the enticement only to exemption from taxes.\u00a0 The minimum interference policy of the government on the Freeport extends to the kind of business that investors may embark on and the articles which they may import or export into and out of the zone.\u00a0 A contrary interpretation would defeat the very purpose of the Freeport and drive away investors.\n\nIt does not mean, however, that the right of Freeport enterprises to import all types of goods and article is absolute. Such right is of course subject to the limitation that articles absolutely prohibited by law cannot be imported into the Freeport. [35] Nevertheless, in determining whether the prohibition would apply to the Freeport, resort to the purpose of the prohibition is necessary.\n\nIn issuing EO 156, particularly the prohibition on importation under Article 2, Section 3.1, the President envisioned to rationalize the importation of used motor vehicles and to enhance the capabilities of the Philippine motor manufacturing firms to be globally competitive producers of completely build-up units and their parts and components for the local and export markets. [36] In justifying the issuance of EO 156, petitioners alleged that there has been a decline in the sales of new vehicles and a remarkable growth of the sales of imported used motor vehicles.\u00a0 To address the same, the President issued the questioned EO to prevent further erosion of the already depressed market base of the local motor vehicle industry and to curtail the harmful effects of the increase in the importation of used motor vehicles. [37]\n\nTaking our bearings from the foregoing discussions, we hold that the importation ban runs afoul the third requisite for a valid administrative order.\u00a0 To be valid, an administrative issuance must not be ultra vires or beyond the limits of the authority conferred. It must not supplant or modify the Constitution, its enabling statute and other existing laws, for such is the sole function of the legislature which the other branches of the government cannot usurp.\u00a0 As held in United BF Homeowner\u2019s Association v. BF Homes, Inc .: [38]\nThe rule-making power of a public administrative body is a delegated legislative power, which it may not use either to abridge the authority given it by Congress or the Constitution or to enlarge its power beyond the scope intended.\u00a0 Constitutional and statutory provisions control what rules and regulations may be promulgated by such a body, as well as with respect to what fields are subject to regulation by it.\u00a0 It may not make rules and regulations which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or a statute, particularly the statute it is administering or which created it, or which are in derogation of, or defeat, the purpose of a statute.\nIn the instant case, the subject matter of the laws authorizing the President to regulate or forbid importation of used motor vehicles, is the domestic industry .\u00a0 EO 156, however, exceeded the scope of its application by extending the prohibition on the importation of used cars to the Freeport, which RA 7227, considers to some extent, a foreign territory. The domestic industry which the EO seeks to protect is actually the \u201c customs territory \u201d which is defined under the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7227, as follows:\n\u201c the portion of the Philippines outside the Subic Bay Freeport where the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines and other national tariff and customs laws are in force and effect .\u201d [39]\nThe proscription in the importation of used motor vehicles should be operative only outside the Freeport and the inclusion of said zone within the ambit of the prohibition is an invalid modification of RA 7227.\u00a0 Indeed, when the application of an administrative issuance modifies existing laws or exceeds the intended scope, as in the instant case, the issuance becomes void, not only for being ultra vires, but also for being unreasonable.\n\nThis brings us to the fourth requisite . It is an axiom in administrative law that administrative authorities should not act arbitrarily and capriciously in the issuance of rules and regulations.\u00a0 To be valid, such rules and regulations must be reasonable and fairly adapted to secure the end in view.\u00a0 If shown to bear no reasonable relation to the purposes for which they were authorized to be issued, then they must be held to be invalid. [40]\n\nThere is no doubt that the issuance of the ban to protect the domestic industry is a reasonable exercise of police power.\u00a0 The deterioration of the local motor manufacturing firms due to the influx of imported used motor vehicles is an urgent national concern that needs to be swiftly addressed by the President.\u00a0 In the exercise of delegated police power, the executive can therefore validly proscribe the importation of these vehicles.\u00a0 Thus, in Taxicab Operators of Metro Manila, Inc. v. Board of Transportation , [41] the Court held that a regulation phasing out taxi cabs more than six years old is a valid exercise of police power.\u00a0 The regulation was sustained as reasonable holding that the purpose thereof was to promote the convenience and comfort and protect the safety of the passengers.\n\nThe problem, however, lies with respect to the application of the importation ban to the Freeport.\u00a0 The Court finds no logic in the all encompassing application of the assailed provision to the Freeport which is outside the customs territory.\u00a0 As long as the used motor vehicles do not enter the customs territory, the injury or harm sought to be prevented or remedied will not arise.\u00a0 The application of the law should be consistent with the purpose of and reason for the law. Ratione cessat lex, et cessat lex .\u00a0 When the reason for the law ceases, the law ceases.\u00a0 It is not the letter alone but the spirit of the law also that gives it life. [42] To apply the proscription to the Freeport would not serve the purpose of the EO.\u00a0 Instead of improving the general economy of the country, the application of the importation ban in the Freeport would subvert the avowed purpose of RA 7227 which is to create a market that would draw investors and ultimately boost the national economy.\n\nIn similar cases, we also declared void the administrative issuance or ordinances concerned for being unreasonable.\u00a0 To illustrate, in De la Cruz v. Paras , [43] the Court held as unreasonable and unconstitutional an ordinance characterized by overbreadth.\u00a0 In that case, the Municipality of Bocaue, Bulacan, prohibited the operation of all night clubs, cabarets and dance halls within its jurisdiction for the protection of public morals.\u00a0 As explained by the Court:\nx x x It cannot be said that such a sweeping exercise of a lawmaking power by Bocaue could qualify under the term reasonable.\u00a0 The objective of fostering public morals, a worthy and desirable end can be attained by a measure that does not encompass too wide a field. Certainly the ordinance on its face is characterized by overbreadth. The purpose sought to be achieved could have been attained by reasonable restrictions rather than by an absolute prohibition.\u00a0 The admonition in Salaveria should be heeded: \u201cThe Judiciary should not lightly set aside legislative action when there is not a clear invasion of personal or property rights under the guise of police regulation.\u201d\u00a0 It is clear that in the guise of a police regulation, there was in this instance a clear invasion of personal or property rights, personal in the case of those individuals desirous of patronizing those night clubs and property in terms of the investments made and salaries to be earned by those therein employed.\nLupangco v. Court of Appeals , [44] is a case involving a resolution issued by the Professional Regulation Commission which prohibited examinees from attending review classes and receiving handout materials, tips, and the like three days before the date of examination in order to preserve the integrity and purity of the licensure examinations in accountancy. Besides being unreasonable on its face and violative of academic freedom, the measure was found to be more sweeping than what was necessary, viz:\nNeedless to say, the enforcement of Resolution No. 105 is not a guarantee that the alleged leakages in the licensure examinations will be eradicated or at least minimized. Making the examinees suffer by depriving them of legitimate means of review or preparation on those last three precious days \u2014 when they should be refreshing themselves with all that they have learned in the review classes and preparing their mental and psychological make-up for the examination day itself \u2014 would be like uprooting the tree to get rid of a rotten branch. What is needed to be done by the respondent is to find out the source of such leakages and stop it right there. If corrupt officials or personnel should be terminated from their loss, then so be it. Fixers or swindlers should be flushed out. Strict guidelines to be observed by examiners should be set up and if violations are committed, then licenses should be suspended or revoked. x x x\nIn Lucena Grand Central Terminal, Inc. v. JAC Liner, Inc ., [45] the Court\u00a0 likewise struck down as unreasonable and overbreadth a city ordinance granting an exclusive franchise for 25 years, renewable for another 25 years, to one entity for the construction and operation of one common bus and jeepney terminal facility in Lucena City.\u00a0 While professedly aimed towards alleviating the traffic congestion alleged to have been caused by the existence of various bus and jeepney terminals within the city, the ordinance was held to be beyond what is reasonably necessary to solve the traffic problem in the city.\n\nBy parity of reasoning, the importation ban in this case should also be declared void for its too sweeping and unnecessary application to the Freeport which has no bearing on the objective of the prohibition.\u00a0 If the aim of the EO is to prevent the entry of used motor vehicles from the Freeport to the customs territory, the solution is not to forbid entry of these vehicles into the Freeport, but to intensify governmental campaign and measures to thwart illegal ingress of used motor vehicles into the customs territory.\n\nAt this juncture, it must be mentioned that on June 19, 1993, President Fidel V. Ramos issued Executive Order No. 97-A, \u201cFurther Clarifying The Tax And Duty-Free Privilege Within The Subic Special Economic And Free Port Zone,\u201d Section 1 of which provides:\nSECTION 1.\u00a0 The following guidelines shall govern the tax and duty-free privilege within the Secured Area of the Subic Special Economic and Free Port Zone:\n\n1.1.\u00a0 The Secured Area consisting of the presently fenced-in former Subic Naval Base shall be the only completely tax and duty-free area in the SSEFPZ.\u00a0 Business enterprises and individuals (Filipinos and foreigners) residing within the Secured Area are free to import raw materials, capital goods, equipment, and consumer items tax and dutry-free.\u00a0 Consumption items, however, must be consumed within the Secured Area .\u00a0 Removal of raw materials, capital goods, equipment and consumer items out of the Secured Area for sale to non-SSEFPZ registered enterprises shall be subject to the usual taxes and duties, except as may be provided herein.\nIn Tiu v. Court of Appeals [46] as reiterated in Coconut Oil Refiners Association, Inc. v. Torres , [47] this provision limiting the special privileges on tax and duty-free importation in the presently fenced-in former Subic Naval Base has been declared valid and constitutional and in accordance with RA 7227.\u00a0 Consistent with these rulings and for easier management and monitoring of activities and to prevent fraudulent importation of merchandise and smuggling, the free flow and importation of used motor vehicles shall be operative only within the \u201csecured area.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the Court finds that Article 2, Section 3.1 of EO 156 is void insofar as it is made applicable to the presently secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area as stated in Section 1.1 of EO 97-A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to the separability clause [48] of EO 156, Section 3.1 is declared valid insofar as it applies to the customs territory or the Philippine territory outside the presently secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area as stated in Section 1.1 of EO 97-A.\u00a0 Hence, used motor vehicles that come into the Philippine territory via the secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area may be stored, used or traded therein, or exported out of the Philippine territory, but they cannot be imported into the Philippine territory outside of the secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petitions are PARTIALLY GRANTED and the May 24, 2004 Decisions of Branch 72, Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, in Civil Case No. 20-0-04 and Civil Case No. 22-0-04; and the February 14, 2005 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 63284, are MODIFIED insofar as they declared Article 2, Section 3.1 of Executive Order No. 156, void in its entirety.\n\nSaid provision is declared VALID insofar as it applies to the Philippine territory outside the presently fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area and VOID with respect to its application to the secured fenced-in former Subic Naval Base area.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Puno, Quisumbing, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Carpio-Morales,\u00a0 Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario and Garcia, JJ., concur.\nCorona and Callejo, Sr., JJ.

      "title": "GUILLERMINA BALUYUT, PETITIONER, VS. EULOGIO POBLETE, SALUD POBLETE AND THE HON.COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.: Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated December 21, 1999 and its Resolution[2] of August 4, 2000 in CA-G.R. CV No. 51534. The assailed CA Decision affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig, Branch 167 which dismissed herein petitioner's Complaint in Civil Case No. 52268, while the questioned Resolution denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.The facts of the case are as follows:On July 20, 1981, herein petitioner, Guillermina Baluyut (Baluyut), loaned from the spouses Eulogio and Salud Poblete the sum of P850,000.00. As evidence of her indebtedness, Baluyut signed, on even date, a promissory note for the amount borrowed[3]. Under the promissory note, the loan shall mature in one month. To secure the payment of her obligation, she conveyed to the Poblete spouses, by way of a real estate mortgage contract, a house and lot she owns, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 137129 and located in Barrio Mapuntod, then Municipality of Mandaluyong, Province of Rizal.[4] Upon maturity of the loan, Baluyut failed to pay her indebtedness. The Poblete spouses subsequently decided to extrajudicially foreclose the real estate mortgage. On August 27, 1982, the mortgaged property was sold on auction by the Provincial Sheriff of Rizal to the Poblete spouses who were the highest bidders, as evidenced by a Certificate of Sale issued pursuant thereto.[5] Baluyut failed to redeem the subject property within the period required by law prompting Eulogio Poblete to execute an Affidavit of Consolidation of Title.[6] Subsequently, TCT No. 43445 was issued in the name of Eulogio and the heirs of Salud, who in the meantime, died.[7] However, Baluyut remained in possession of the subject property and refused to vacate the same. Hence, Eulogio and the heirs of Salud filed a Petition for the issuance of a writ of possession with the RTC of Pasig. The case was docketed as Case No. R-3457. Subsequently, the trial court issued an order granting the writ of possession. However, before Eulogio and the heirs of Salud could take possession of the property, Baluyut filed an action for annulment of mortgage, extrajudicial foreclosure and sale of the subject property, as well as cancellation of the title issued in the name of Eulogio and the heirs of Salud, plus damages. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 52268 and was subsequently consolidated with Case No. R-3457. In the meantime, Eulogio died and was substituted by his heirs. After trial on the merits, the trial court issued a Decision on September 13, 1995 dismissing Baluyut's complaint.[8]Aggrieved by the trial court's Decision, herein petitioner filed an appeal with the CA.On December 21, 1999, the CA promulgated the presently assailed Decision affirming the judgment of the trial court.[9]Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied in a Resolution issued by the CA on August 4, 2000.[10]Hence, the present petition with the following assignment of errors:IThe decision and the resolution are both palpably infirm in holding that no prior demand to pay is necessary for a loan to mature when there is conflict between the date of maturity of the loan as stated in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and the Promissory Note on the one hand and the real date of its maturity on the other.IIThe decision and the resolution are both palpably infirm in holding that the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure proceedings should be presumed to have regularly performed his duty in conducting the foreclosure proceedings despite the inability of the Office of the Provincial Sheriff who had been ordered by the trial court to produce the records of the foreclosure in question and show that there was compliance with the required posting of notices in three public places and with the required publication for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation.IIIThat the Decision and Resolution are legally infirm in holding that because the Petitioner-Appellant failed to invoke her right to be sent an Assessment Notice by the highest bidder thirty days before the expiration of the right of legal redemption during the trial and on appeal, it should be deemed that she had waived her right to this benefit under the law despite a clear showing that the said mandatory requirement should have been strictly observed before title could be consolidated in favor of the highest bidder as provided for in the certificate of sale issued by the sheriff.[11]In her first assigned error, petitioner contends that herein private respondents' witness, a certain Atty. Edwina Mendoza, is a competent witness and that her testimony, that the maturity of the loan is one year, is acceptable proof of the existence of collateral agreements which were entered into by the parties who executed the Promissory Note and the Real Estate Mortgage prior, contemporaneous and subsequent to the execution of these documents. Petitioner also argues that the issue of the real date of the maturity of the loan can be settled only by a formal letter of demand indicating the sum due and the specific date of payment which is the duty of the private respondents to give; that absent said letter of demand, the loan may not be considered to have matured; that, as a consequence, the property given as a collateral may not be foreclosed and the subsequent consolidation of title over the subject property should be annulled. Petitioner further contends that even if the issue on the term of the loan was first brought up in petitioner's Addendum to the Motion for Reconsideration filed with the CA, the appellate court may still properly consider this issue in the interest of justice and equity considering that this is a matter of record and has some bearing on the other issues submitted for resolution.Anent her second assignment of error, petitioner contends that the CA erred in relying on the rule on presumption of regularity in the sheriff's performance of his duties relative to the foreclosure of the questioned property absent any evidence presented by petitioner to prove that the sheriff failed to comply with the legal requirements in the sale of the foreclosed properties. Petitioner argues that under the law, the sheriff is required to submit an Affidavit of Posting of Notices to the clerk of court and to the judge before he is allowed to schedule an auction sale. However, per letter from the Office of the Clerk of Court, there are no records of the foreclosure proceedings involving the subject property. Based on this premise, petitioner concludes that since the existence of these documents is supposed to be in the custody of the sheriff's office and that the private respondents are supposed to have copies of these documents, being the ones who prosecuted the foreclosure proceedings, petitioner's contention that there was non-compliance with the legal requirements for the validity of the foreclosure proceedings partakes of a negative allegation which she need not prove. Petitioner argues that in the absence of documents evidencing the foreclosure proceedings over the subject property, the lower court should have acted judiciously by annulling the foreclosure and ordering the repeat of the proceedings.As to her third assigned error, petitioner asserts that despite the fact that she is entitled under the law to an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption coming from the highest bidder 30 days before the expiration of the period to redeem apprising her of the principal amount, the interest, taxes and other lawful fees due in case she opts to exercise her right of redemption, she did not receive any notice of this kind. Petitioner contends that her right to this notice is not subject to waiver and that her failure to invoke the same during trial and on appeal does not preclude her from invoking such right in her motion for reconsideration filed with the CA and in the present petition.In their Motion to Dismiss, which the Court treated as their comment on the petition, private respondents contend that the petition should be dismissed on the ground that no question of law was raised therein. Private respondents argue that the issue as to the supposed conflict between the date of maturity of the loan as stated in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and the Promissory Note, on one hand, and the real date of maturity as agreed upon by the parties, on the other, as well as the question of whether or not the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure proceedings involving the subject property complied with the legal requirements of posting and publication are questions of fact which are not proper subjects of a petition for review on certiorari. Furthermore, private respondents also assert in their Memorandum that the questions of fact being raised by petitioner had already been ruled upon by the RTC and the CA in favor of private respondents; that the findings of fact of the RTC and the CA are binding on this Court.The Court finds the petition without merit.Petitioner admits that the issue regarding the date of maturity of the loan which she incurred from the Poblete spouses was first brought up only in her Addendum to the Motion for Reconsideration filed before the CA. In an effort to clothe her argument with merit, petitioner contends that the CA should have properly considered this issue in the interest of justice and equity. The Court is not persuaded. It is settled that an issue not raised during trial could not be raised for the first time on appeal as to do so would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process.[12] Contrary to petitioner's contention, it would be the height of injustice if the CA allowed her to raise an issue at a very late stage of the proceedings. It would be unfair to the adverse party who would have no opportunity to present evidence in contra to the new theory, which it could have done had it been aware of it at the time of the hearing before the trial court.[13] It is true that this rule admits of exceptions as in cases of lack of jurisdiction, where the lower court committed plain error, where there are jurisprudential developments affecting the issues, or when the issues raised present a matter of public policy.[14] However, the Court finds that none of these exceptions are present in the instant case.In addition, the issue regarding the date of maturity of the loan is factual and settled is the rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.[15] It is not the function of this Court to review, examine and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented.[16] While there are also exceptions to this rule such as when the factual findings of the trial court and the CA are contradictory; when the inference made by the CA is manifestly mistaken or absurd; when the judgment of the CA is premised on its misapprehension of facts; and, when the CA failed to resolve relevant facts which, if properly considered, would justify a modification or reversal of the decision of the appellate court,[17] this Court finds that the present case does not fall under any of these exceptions.Even if petitioner had properly raised the issue regarding the real date of maturity of the loan, it is a long-held cardinal rule that when the terms of an agreement are reduced to writing, it is deemed to contain all the terms agreed upon and no evidence of such terms can be admitted other than the contents of the agreement itself.[18] In the present case, the promissory note and the real estate mortgage are the law between petitioner and private respondents. It is not disputed that under the Promissory Note dated July 20, 1981, the loan shall mature in one month from date of the said Promissory Note.Petitioner makes much of the testimony of Atty. Edwina Mendoza that the maturity of the loan which petitioner incurred is one year. However, evidence of a prior or contemporaneous verbal agreement is generally not admissible to vary, contradict or defeat the operation of a valid contract.[19] While parol evidence is admissible to explain the meaning of written contracts, it cannot serve the purpose of incorporating into the contract additional contemporaneous conditions which are not mentioned at all in writing, unless there has been fraud or mistake.[20] In the instant case, aside from the testimony of Atty. Mendoza, no other evidence was presented to prove that the real date of maturity of the loan is one year. In fact there was not even any allegation in the Complaint and in the Memorandum filed by petitioner with the trial court to the effect that there has been fraud or mistake as to the date of the loan's maturity as contained in the Promissory Note of July 20, 1981.Moreover, during her cross-examination, petitioner herself never claimed that the loan shall mature in one year despite being questioned regarding its maturity. She testified thus:Q You said that you borrowed P850,000.00 to [sic] Mrs. Poblete, is that correct?A Yes sir.Q In fact, you signed a Real Estate Mortgage marked as Exhibit \"B\"?A Yes sir.Q When you signed this Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, you also signed a Promisory [sic] Note, is that correct?RECORD: Witness did not answer.Q Did you sign or not a Promisory [sic] note in relation to this Real Estate Mortgage.A I don't remember sir.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdQ You don't remember. I am showing to you a Promisory Note with your signature, did you not sign this dated July 20, 1981?A Yes sir.Q Now, according to this Promisory [sic] Note, the loan is for one (1) month from July 20, 1981, did you pay for that loan on its maturity date?A I did not sir.Q Up to now, you have not paid that loan?A I have not sir.Q What happen [sic] to the mortgage when you did not paid [sic] that loan from one (1) month after July 20, 1981?A None sir.[21]In sum, petitioner failed to present clear and convincing evidence to prove her allegation that the real agreement of the parties is for the loan to mature in one year.As to the second assigned error, the prevailing jurisprudence is that foreclosure proceedings have in their favor the presumption of regularity and the burden of evidence to rebut the same is on the petitioner.[22] Moreover, the Court agrees with the CA that a mortgagor who alleges absence of a requisite has the burden of establishing that fact.[23] Petitioner failed in this respect as she did not present any evidence to prove her allegations.Moreover, the fact that the records of the foreclosure proceedings involving the subject property could not be found does not necessarily mean that the legal requirements of posting and publication had not been complied with. Private respondents were able to present the Affidavit of Publication[24] executed by the publisher of Nuevo Horizonte, a newspaper of general circulation, together with a clipping[25] of the published notice attached thereto, to prove that notices of the sale of the subject property were validly published in accordance with law. The affidavit of publication executed by the publisher of a newspaper stating therein that said newspaper is of general circulation and that the requisite notice of foreclosure sale was published in said paper in accordance with law constitutes prima facie evidence of compliance with the required publication.[26]As to the alleged lack of posting of the notices of sale in at least three public places, herein petitioner failed to discharge her burden of proving by convincing evidence her allegation that there was actually no compliance with the posting requirement. Hence, in the absence of contrary evidence, the presumption prevails that the sheriff performed his official duty of posting the notices of sale.[27]The Court's ruling in Olizon v. Court of Appeals,[28] insofar as posting and publication requirements in mortgage foreclosure sales are concerned, is instructive:We take judicial notice of the fact that newspaper publications have more far-reaching effects than posting on bulletin boards in public places. There is a greater probability that an announcement or notice published in a newspaper of general circulation, which is distributed nationwide, shall have a readership of more people than that posted in a public bulletin board, no matter how strategic its location may be, which caters only to a limited few. Hence, the publication of the notice of sale in [a] newspaper of general circulation alone is more than sufficient compliance with the notice-posting requirement of the law. By such publication, a reasonably wide publicity had been effected such that those interested might attend the public sale, and the purpose of the law had been thereby subserved.The object of a notice of sale is to inform the public of the nature and condition of the property to be sold, and of the time, place and terms of the sale. Notices are given for the purpose of securing bidders and to prevent a sacrifice of the property. If these objects are attained, immaterial errors and mistakes will not affect the sufficiency of the notice; but if mistakes or omissions occur in the notices of sale, which are calculated to deter or mislead bidders, to depreciate the value of the property, or to prevent it from bringing a fair price, such mistakes or omissions will be fatal to the validity of the notice, and also to the sale made pursuant thereto.In the instant case, the aforesaid objective was attained since there was sufficient publicity of the sale through the newspaper publication. There is completely no showing that the property was sold for a price far below its value as to insinuate any bad faith, nor was there any showing or even an intimation of collusion between the sheriff who conducted the sale and respondent bank. This being so, the alleged non-compliance with the posting requirement, even if true, will not justify the setting aside of the sale.[29]In the present case, there was sufficient evidence to prove that notices of the foreclosure sale of the subject property were published in accordance with law and that there was no allegation, much less proof, that the property was sold for a price which is considerably lower than its value as to show collusion between the sheriff and herein private respondents. Hence, even granting that the sheriff failed to post the notices of foreclosure in at least three public places, such failure, pursuant to Olizon, is not a sufficient basis in nullifying the auction sale and the subsequent issuance of title in favor of private respondents.As to petitioner's argument that the sheriff in charge of the auction sale is required to execute an affidavit of posting of notices, the Court agrees with private respondents' contention that petitioner's reliance on the provisions of Section 5, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 720, as amended by R.A. No. 5939[30], as well as on the cases of Roxas v. Court of Appeals,[31] Pulido v. Court of Appeals[32] and Tambunting v. Court of Appeals,[33] is misplaced as the said provision of law refers specifically and exclusively to the foreclosure of mortgages covering loans granted by rural banks. In the present case, the contracts of loan and mortgage are between private individuals. The governing law, insofar as the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings are concerned, is Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118.[34] Section 3 of the said law reads as follows:Sec. 3. Notice shall be given by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated and if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city.Unlike in the amended provisions of Section 5, R.A. No. 720, nowhere in the above-quoted provision of Act No. 3135, as amended, or in any Section thereof, is it required that the sheriff must execute an affidavit to prove that he published notices of foreclosure in accordance with the requirements of law.As to the last assigned error, suffice it to say that the Court agrees with the findings of the CA that the issue regarding petitioner's right to receive an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption from private respondents as the highest bidders during the auction sale was raised only in her Addendum to Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of the CA. The Court reiterates the rule that points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.[35]Moreover, like the issue regarding the date of maturity of the loan, the question of whether or not petitioner received a copy of an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption from private respondents is also factual. As earlier explained, questions of fact are not proper subjects of appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as this mode of appeal is confined to questions of law.[36]Besides, there is nothing under Act No. 3135 which requires the highest bidder or purchaser to furnish the mortgagor or redemptioner an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption prior to the expiration of the period of redemption. Even the pertinent provisions of Section 30, Rule 39[37] of the old Rules of Court, which are the rules applicable in the present case, do not require that the mortgagor or redemptioner be furnished by the purchaser notice of any assessments or taxes which the latter may have paid after the purchase of the auctioned property, thus:Sec. 30. Time and manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions, notice to be given and filed. - The judgment debtor or redemptioner may redeem the property from the purchaser at any time within twelve (12) months after the sale, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase with one per centum per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may have paid thereon after purchase and interest on such last named amount at the same rate; and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under which such purchase was made, and the amount of such other lien, with interest. Property so redeemed may again be redeemed within sixty (60) days after the last redemption upon payment of the sum paid on the last redemption, with two per centum thereon in addition, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid thereon after redemption by him, with interest of such last-named amount, and in addition, the amount of any liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner within sixty (60) days after the last redemption, on paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption, with two per centum thereon in addition, and the amounts of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption thereon, with interest thereon, and the amount of any liens held by the last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest.Written notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made the sale and a duplicate filed with the Registrar of Deeds of the province, and if any assessment of taxes are paid by the redemptioner or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like manner be given to the officer and filed with the Registrar of Deeds; if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments, taxes, or liens. (emphasis supplied)Hence, even granting, for the sake of argument, that private respondents failed to comply with the directive in the Certificate of Sale issued by the Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff of Rizal and the Deputy Sheriff In-Charge by giving a copy of statements of the amount of assessments or taxes which they may have paid on account of the purchase of the subject property, such failure would not invalidate the auction sale and the subsequent transfer of title over the subject property in their favor.It bears to note that the purpose for requiring the purchaser to furnish copies of the amounts of assessments or taxes which he may have paid is to inform the mortgagor or redemptioner of the actual amount which he should pay in case he chooses to exercise his right of redemption. If no such notice is given, the only effect is that the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments or taxes.[38] In fact, it would have been beneficial on the part of herein petitioner if private respondents failed to submit to the office of the sheriff and furnish her a copy of the statements of the taxes and assessments they paid because in such a case petitioner would have been excused from reimbursing such assessments and taxes if she redeemed the property. The fact remains, however, that petitioner failed to redeem the subject property.WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED in toto.Costs against petitioner.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Justice Mercedes Gozo-Dadole (now retired) and concurred in by Justices Eubulo G.

EULOGIO POBLETE, SALUD POBLETE AND THE HON.COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated December 21, 1999 and its Resolution [2] of August 4, 2000 in CA-G.R. CV No. 51534. The assailed CA Decision affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig, Branch 167 which dismissed herein petitioner's Complaint in Civil Case No. 52268, while the questioned Resolution denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\n\nOn July 20, 1981, herein petitioner, Guillermina Baluyut (Baluyut), loaned from the spouses Eulogio and Salud Poblete the sum of P850,000.00. As evidence of her indebtedness, Baluyut signed, on even date, a promissory note for the amount borrowed [3] . Under the promissory note, the loan shall mature in one month. To secure the payment of her obligation, she conveyed to the Poblete spouses, by way of a real estate mortgage contract, a house and lot she owns, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 137129 and located in Barrio Mapuntod, then Municipality of Mandaluyong, Province of Rizal. [4] Upon maturity of the loan, Baluyut failed to pay her indebtedness. The Poblete spouses subsequently decided to extrajudicially foreclose the real estate mortgage. On August 27, 1982, the mortgaged property was sold on auction by the Provincial Sheriff of Rizal to the Poblete spouses who were the highest bidders, as evidenced by a Certificate of Sale issued pursuant thereto. [5] Baluyut failed to redeem the subject property within the period required by law prompting Eulogio Poblete to execute an Affidavit of Consolidation of Title. [6] Subsequently, TCT No. 43445 was issued in the name of Eulogio and the heirs of Salud, who in the meantime, died. [7] However, Baluyut remained in possession of the subject property and refused to vacate the same. Hence, Eulogio and the heirs of Salud filed a Petition for the issuance of a writ of possession with the RTC of Pasig. The case was docketed as Case No. R-3457. Subsequently, the trial court issued an order granting the writ of possession. However, before Eulogio and the heirs of Salud could take possession of the property, Baluyut filed an action for annulment of mortgage, extrajudicial foreclosure and sale of the subject property, as well as cancellation of the title issued in the name of Eulogio and the heirs of Salud, plus damages. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 52268 and was subsequently consolidated with Case No. R-3457. In the meantime, Eulogio died and was substituted by his heirs. After trial on the merits, the trial court issued a Decision on September 13, 1995 dismissing Baluyut's complaint. [8]\n\nAggrieved by the trial court's Decision, herein petitioner filed an appeal with the CA.\n\nOn December 21, 1999, the CA promulgated the presently assailed Decision affirming the judgment of the trial court. [9]\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied in a Resolution issued by the CA on August 4, 2000. [10]\n\nHence, the present petition with the following assignment of errors:\nI\n\nThe decision and the resolution are both palpably infirm in holding that no prior demand to pay is necessary for a loan to mature when there is conflict between the date of maturity of the loan as stated in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and the Promissory Note on the one hand and the real date of its maturity on the other.\n\nII\n\nThe decision and the resolution are both palpably infirm in holding that the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure proceedings should be presumed to have regularly performed his duty in conducting the foreclosure proceedings despite the inability of the Office of the Provincial Sheriff who had been ordered by the trial court to produce the records of the foreclosure in question and show that there was compliance with the required posting of notices in three public places and with the required publication for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation.\n\nIII\n\nThat the Decision and Resolution are legally infirm in holding that because the Petitioner-Appellant failed to invoke her right to be sent an Assessment Notice by the highest bidder thirty days before the expiration of the right of legal redemption during the trial and on appeal, it should be deemed that she had waived her right to this benefit under the law despite a clear showing that the said mandatory requirement should have been strictly observed before title could be consolidated in favor of the highest bidder as provided for in the certificate of sale issued by the sheriff. [11] In her first assigned error, petitioner contends that herein private respondents' witness, a certain Atty. Edwina Mendoza, is a competent witness and that her testimony, that the maturity of the loan is one year, is acceptable proof of the existence of collateral agreements which were entered into by the parties who executed the Promissory Note and the Real Estate Mortgage prior, contemporaneous and subsequent to the execution of these documents. Petitioner also argues that the issue of the real date of the maturity of the loan can be settled only by a formal letter of demand indicating the sum due and the specific date of payment which is the duty of the private respondents to give; that absent said letter of demand, the loan may not be considered to have matured; that, as a consequence, the property given as a collateral may not be foreclosed and the subsequent consolidation of title over the subject property should be annulled. Petitioner further contends that even if the issue on the term of the loan was first brought up in petitioner's Addendum to the Motion for Reconsideration filed with the CA, the appellate court may still properly consider this issue in the interest of justice and equity considering that this is a matter of record and has some bearing on the other issues submitted for resolution.\n\nAnent her second assignment of error, petitioner contends that the CA erred in relying on the rule on presumption of regularity in the sheriff's performance of his duties relative to the foreclosure of the questioned property absent any evidence presented by petitioner to prove that the sheriff failed to comply with the legal requirements in the sale of the foreclosed properties. Petitioner argues that under the law, the sheriff is required to submit an Affidavit of Posting of Notices to the clerk of court and to the judge before he is allowed to schedule an auction sale. However, per letter from the Office of the Clerk of Court, there are no records of the foreclosure proceedings involving the subject property. Based on this premise, petitioner concludes that since the existence of these documents is supposed to be in the custody of the sheriff's office and that the private respondents are supposed to have copies of these documents, being the ones who prosecuted the foreclosure proceedings, petitioner's contention that there was non-compliance with the legal requirements for the validity of the foreclosure proceedings partakes of a negative allegation which she need not prove. Petitioner argues that in the absence of documents evidencing the foreclosure proceedings over the subject property, the lower court should have acted judiciously by annulling the foreclosure and ordering the repeat of the proceedings.\n\nAs to her third assigned error, petitioner asserts that despite the fact that she is entitled under the law to an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption coming from the highest bidder 30 days before the expiration of the period to redeem apprising her of the principal amount, the interest, taxes and other lawful fees due in case she opts to exercise her right of redemption, she did not receive any notice of this kind. Petitioner contends that her right to this notice is not subject to waiver and that her failure to invoke the same during trial and on appeal does not preclude her from invoking such right in her motion for reconsideration filed with the CA and in the present petition.\n\nIn their Motion to Dismiss, which the Court treated as their comment on the petition, private respondents contend that the petition should be dismissed on the ground that no question of law was raised therein. Private respondents argue that the issue as to the supposed conflict between the date of maturity of the loan as stated in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and the Promissory Note, on one hand, and the real date of maturity as agreed upon by the parties, on the other, as well as the question of whether or not the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure proceedings involving the subject property complied with the legal requirements of posting and publication are questions of fact which are not proper subjects of a petition for review on certiorari . Furthermore, private respondents also assert in their Memorandum that the questions of fact being raised by petitioner had already been ruled upon by the RTC and the CA in favor of private respondents; that the findings of fact of the RTC and the CA are binding on this Court.\n\nThe Court finds the petition without merit.\n\nPetitioner admits that the issue regarding the date of maturity of the loan which she incurred from the Poblete spouses was first brought up only in her Addendum to the Motion for Reconsideration filed before the CA. In an effort to clothe her argument with merit, petitioner contends that the CA should have properly considered this issue in the interest of justice and equity. The Court is not persuaded. It is settled that an issue not raised during trial could not be raised for the first time on appeal as to do so would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process. [12] Contrary to petitioner's contention, it would be the height of injustice if the CA allowed her to raise an issue at a very late stage of the proceedings. It would be unfair to the adverse party who would have no opportunity to present evidence in contra to the new theory, which it could have done had it been aware of it at the time of the hearing before the trial court. [13] It is true that this rule admits of exceptions as in cases of lack of jurisdiction, where the lower court committed plain error, where there are jurisprudential developments affecting the issues, or when the issues raised present a matter of public policy. [14] However, the Court finds that none of these exceptions are present in the instant case.\n\nIn addition, the issue regarding the date of maturity of the loan is factual and settled is the rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts. [15] It is not the function of this Court to review, examine and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented. [16] While there are also exceptions to this rule such as when the factual findings of the trial court and the CA are contradictory; when the inference made by the CA is manifestly mistaken or absurd; when the judgment of the CA is premised on its misapprehension of facts; and, when the CA failed to resolve relevant facts which, if properly considered, would justify a modification or reversal of the decision of the appellate court, [17] this Court finds that the present case does not fall under any of these exceptions.\n\nEven if petitioner had properly raised the issue regarding the real date of maturity of the loan, it is a long-held cardinal rule that when the terms of an agreement are reduced to writing, it is deemed to contain all the terms agreed upon and no evidence of such terms can be admitted other than the contents of the agreement itself. [18] In the present case, the promissory note and the real estate mortgage are the law between petitioner and private respondents. It is not disputed that under the Promissory Note dated July 20, 1981, the loan shall mature in one month from date of the said Promissory Note.\n\nPetitioner makes much of the testimony of Atty. Edwina Mendoza that the maturity of the loan which petitioner incurred is one year. However, evidence of a prior or contemporaneous verbal agreement is generally not admissible to vary, contradict or defeat the operation of a valid contract. [19] While parol evidence is admissible to explain the meaning of written contracts, it cannot serve the purpose of incorporating into the contract additional contemporaneous conditions which are not mentioned at all in writing, unless there has been fraud or mistake. [20] In the instant case, aside from the testimony of Atty. Mendoza, no other evidence was presented to prove that the real date of maturity of the loan is one year. In fact there was not even any allegation in the Complaint and in the Memorandum filed by petitioner with the trial court to the effect that there has been fraud or mistake as to the date of the loan's maturity as contained in the Promissory Note of July 20, 1981.\n\nMoreover, during her cross-examination, petitioner herself never claimed that the loan shall mature in one year despite being questioned regarding its maturity. She testified thus:\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said that you borrowed P850,000.00 to [sic] Mrs. Poblete, is that correct?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, you signed a Real Estate Mortgage marked as Exhibit \"B\"?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you signed this Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, you also signed a Promisory [sic] Note, is that correct?\n\nRECORD: Witness did not answer.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you sign or not a Promisory [sic] note in relation to this Real Estate Mortgage.\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I don't remember sir.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You don't remember. I am showing to you a Promisory Note with your signature, did you not sign this dated July 20, 1981?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, according to this Promisory [sic] Note, the loan is for one (1) month from July 20, 1981, did you pay for that loan on its maturity date?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I did not sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Up to now, you have not paid that loan?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have not sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What happen [sic] to the mortgage when you did not paid [sic] that loan from one (1) month after July 20, 1981?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None sir. [21] In sum, petitioner failed to present clear and convincing evidence to prove her allegation that the real agreement of the parties is for the loan to mature in one year.\n\nAs to the second assigned error, the prevailing jurisprudence is that foreclosure proceedings have in their favor the presumption of regularity and the burden of evidence to rebut the same is on the petitioner. [22] Moreover, the Court agrees with the CA that a mortgagor who alleges absence of a requisite has the burden of establishing that fact. [23] Petitioner failed in this respect as she did not present any evidence to prove her allegations.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the records of the foreclosure proceedings involving the subject property could not be found does not necessarily mean that the legal requirements of posting and publication had not been complied with. \u00a0Private respondents were able to present the Affidavit of Publication [24] executed by the publisher of Nuevo Horizonte, a newspaper of general circulation, together with a clipping [25] of the published notice attached thereto, to prove that notices of the sale of the subject property were validly published in accordance with law. The affidavit of publication executed by the publisher of a newspaper stating therein that said newspaper is of general circulation and that the requisite notice of foreclosure sale was published in said paper in accordance with law constitutes prima facie evidence of compliance with the required publication. [26]\n\nAs to the alleged lack of posting of the notices of sale in at least three public places, herein petitioner failed to discharge her burden of proving by convincing evidence her allegation that there was actually no compliance with the posting requirement. Hence, in the absence of contrary evidence, the presumption prevails that the sheriff performed his official duty of posting the notices of sale. [27]\n\nThe Court's ruling in Olizon v. Court of Appeals , [28] insofar as posting and publication requirements in mortgage foreclosure sales are concerned, is instructive:\nWe take judicial notice of the fact that newspaper publications have more far-reaching effects than posting on bulletin boards in public places. There is a greater probability that an announcement or notice published in a newspaper of general circulation, which is distributed nationwide, shall have a readership of more people than that posted in a public bulletin board, no matter how strategic its location may be, which caters only to a limited few. Hence, the publication of the notice of sale in [a] newspaper of general circulation alone is more than sufficient compliance with the notice-posting requirement of the law. By such publication, a reasonably wide publicity had been effected such that those interested might attend the public sale, and the purpose of the law had been thereby subserved.\n\nThe object of a notice of sale is to inform the public of the nature and condition of the property to be sold, and of the time, place and terms of the sale. Notices are given for the purpose of securing bidders and to prevent a sacrifice of the property. If these objects are attained, immaterial errors and mistakes will not affect the sufficiency of the notice; but if mistakes or omissions occur in the notices of sale, which are calculated to deter or mislead bidders, to depreciate the value of the property, or to prevent it from bringing a fair price, such mistakes or omissions will be fatal to the validity of the notice, and also to the sale made pursuant thereto.\n\nIn the instant case, the aforesaid objective was attained since there was sufficient publicity of the sale through the newspaper publication. There is completely no showing that the property was sold for a price far below its value as to insinuate any bad faith, nor was there any showing or even an intimation of collusion between the sheriff who conducted the sale and respondent bank. This being so, the alleged non-compliance with the posting requirement, even if true, will not justify the setting aside of the sale. [29] In the present case, there was sufficient evidence to prove that notices of the foreclosure sale of the subject property were published in accordance with law and that there was no allegation, much less proof, that the property was sold for a price which is considerably lower than its value as to show collusion between the sheriff and herein private respondents. Hence, even granting that the sheriff failed to post the notices of foreclosure in at least three public places, such failure, pursuant to Olizon , is not a sufficient basis in nullifying the auction sale and the subsequent issuance of title in favor of private respondents.\n\nAs to petitioner's argument that the sheriff in charge of the auction sale is required to execute an affidavit of posting of notices, the Court agrees with private respondents' contention that petitioner's reliance on the provisions of Section 5, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 720, as amended by R.A. No. 5939 [30] , as well as on the cases of Roxas v.\u00a0 Court of Appeals, [31] Pulido v. Court of Appeals [32] and Tambunting v. Court of Appeals, [33] is misplaced as the said provision of law refers specifically and exclusively to the foreclosure of mortgages covering loans granted by rural banks. In the present case, the contracts of loan and mortgage are between private individuals. The governing law, insofar as the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings are concerned, is Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118. [34] Section 3 of the said law reads as follows:\nSec. 3. Notice shall be given by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated and if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city. Unlike in the amended provisions of Section 5, R.A. No. 720, nowhere in the above-quoted provision of Act No. 3135, as amended, or in any Section thereof, is it required that the sheriff must execute an affidavit to prove that he published notices of foreclosure in accordance with the requirements of law.\n\nAs to the last assigned error, suffice it to say that the Court agrees with the findings of the CA that the issue regarding petitioner's right to receive an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption from private respondents as the highest bidders during the auction sale was raised only in her Addendum to Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of the CA. The Court reiterates the rule that points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. [35]\n\nMoreover, like the issue regarding the date of maturity of the loan, the question of whether or not petitioner received a copy of an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption from private respondents is also factual. As earlier explained, questions of fact are not proper subjects of appeal by certiorar i under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as this mode of appeal is confined to questions of law. [36]\n\nBesides, there is nothing under Act No. 3135 which requires the highest bidder or purchaser to furnish the mortgagor or redemptioner an Assessment Notice or Notice of Redemption prior to the expiration of the period of redemption. Even the pertinent provisions of Section 30, Rule 39 [37] of the old Rules of Court, which are the rules applicable in the present case, do not require that the mortgagor or redemptioner be furnished by the purchaser notice of any assessments or taxes which the latter may have paid after the purchase of the auctioned property, thus:\nSec. 30. Time and manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions, notice to be given and filed. - The judgment debtor or redemptioner may redeem the property from the purchaser at any time within twelve (12) months after the sale, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase with one per centum per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may have paid thereon after purchase and interest on such last named amount at the same rate; and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under which such purchase was made, and the amount of such other lien, with interest. Property so redeemed may again be redeemed within sixty (60) days after the last redemption upon payment of the sum paid on the last redemption, with two per centum thereon in addition, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid thereon after redemption by him, with interest of such last-named amount, and in addition, the amount of any liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner within sixty (60) days after the last redemption, on paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption, with two per centum thereon in addition, and the amounts of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption thereon, with interest thereon, and the amount of any liens held by the last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest.\n\nWritten notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made the sale and a duplicate filed with the Registrar of Deeds of the province, and if any assessment of taxes are paid by the redemptioner or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like manner be given to the officer and filed with the Registrar of Deeds; if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments, taxes, or liens. (emphasis supplied) Hence, even granting, for the sake of argument, that private respondents failed to comply with the directive in the Certificate of Sale issued by the Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff of Rizal and the Deputy Sheriff In-Charge by giving a copy of statements of the amount of assessments or taxes which they may have paid on account of the purchase of the subject property, such failure would not invalidate the auction sale and the subsequent transfer of title over the subject property in their favor.\n\nIt bears to note that the purpose for requiring the purchaser to furnish copies of the amounts of assessments or taxes which he may have paid is to inform the mortgagor or redemptioner of the actual amount which he should pay in case he chooses to exercise his right of redemption. If no such notice is given, the only effect is that the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments or taxes. [38] In fact, it would have been beneficial on the part of herein petitioner if private respondents failed to submit to the office of the sheriff and furnish her a copy of the statements of the taxes and assessments they paid because in such a case petitioner would have been excused from reimbursing such assessments and taxes if she redeemed the property. The fact remains, however, that petitioner failed to redeem the subject property.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED in toto .\n\nCosts against petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Justice Mercedes Gozo-Dadole (now retired) and concurred in by Justices Eubulo G.

NO. 169231, February 15, 2007 ]\n\nTEOFILO CESAR N. ECHEVERRIA, PETITIONER, VS. VENUTEK MEDIKA, INC., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nTEOFILO CESAR N. ECHEVERRIA, PETITIONER, VS. VENUTEK MEDIKA, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nAssailed via petition for review are issuances of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 80966, to wit:\u00a0 a) Decision [1] dated April 27, 2005, which granted respondent\u2019s petition for certiorari, thereby setting aside the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR CA No. 034523-03 and reinstating Labor Arbiter Elias H. Salinas\u2019 decision in NLRC Case No. 00-05-02975-02; and b) Resolution [2] dated August 5, 2005, which denied petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\nTeofilo Cesar N. Echeverria (petitioner) was an employee of Venutek Medika, Inc. (respondent), a corporation engaged in the business of trade and distribution of hospital supplies and equipment and an affiliate of the Dispophil Group of Companies (Dispophil Group). At the time of his termination from employment which is the subject of the present petition, he held the position of assistant marketing manager with a salary of P23,150 a month.\n\nAs a matter of policy, the marketing personnel of the various companies in the Dispophil Group hold a joint marketing cut-off monthly meeting to review the sales and marketing performance of the companies and discuss ways and means to improve them.\u00a0 Sheila Vinuya (Sheila), an assistant regional sales manager, is in charge of conducting the monthly meetings. [3]\n\nPrior to the meeting scheduled on May 2, 2002, petitioner approached Sheila and asked her if he could join the meeting so he could give a short discussion of his vision of corporate \u201coneness\u201d which he believed would help the Dispophil Group generate sales. And he also asked Sheila if he could invite other division heads.\u00a0 Finding the request reasonable, Sheila agreed to let petitioner speak after the meeting. [4]\n\nPetitioner thereupon requested Lemford Suarez (Suarez), a product assistant, to invite all product assistants to attend the May 2, 2002 meeting, informing him that plans and programs to improve collection and product segmentation [5] would be discussed.\n\nDuring the meeting, Sheila, noting the presence of other product assistants and the absence of division heads, went to petitioner\u2019s office to inform him thereof.\u00a0 Petitioner readily admitted that he no longer invited the division heads.\n\nOut of courtesy to petitioner who gave the impression that his discussion of his vision on corporate \u201coneness\u201d [6] was sanctioned by the president and chairman of the Dispophil Group, Sheila allowed him to speak at the beginning of the meeting.\n\nPetitioner was well-prepared for his discussion, bringing with him slides and other paraphernalia. [7] In the course of his discussion, it became apparent that his \u201cvision and mission\u201d differed from that of respondent.\u00a0 Moreover, he made disparaging remarks about one of the senior officers of respondent, Assistant Vice President Marlene Orozco (Marlene), criticizing her character, competency and performance, [8] prompting one of the marketing managers to question his authority to \u201cpreside\u201d over the meeting. [9]\n\nRespondent thus issued a memorandum dated May 3, 2002 requiring petitioner to explain in writing why no disciplinary action should be taken against him, he having uttered during the said meeting, his participation of which was unofficial and unauthorized, \u201cunpleasant things\u201d about one of its key officers, causing confusion among the employees-attendees. [10]\n\nIn accordance with the May 3, 2002 memorandum of respondent, petitioner explained in writing the objectives of the meeting as well as the topics discussed, and he denied having mentioned \u201cunpleasant things\u201d thereat. [11]\n\nRespondent later issued another memorandum, dated May 7, 2002, requiring petitioner to show cause why he should not be dismissed from employment for violation of Article 282 of the Labor Code, [12] specifically: for serious misconduct, commission of a crime or offense against the respondent, and willful breach of trust, [13] in that he used the meeting to unjustifiably insult Marlene, his superior, and to insinuate that the Chairman and President of the Dispophil Group, Jose L. Tambunting, along with his wife, bribed petitioner to execute and attest to an affidavit filed before the Pasig Prosecutor\u2019s Office in a criminal complaint, docketed as I.S. No. 02-03-03111, which acts caused respondent to lose the trust and confidence reposed upon him. [14]\n\nIn connection with the May 2, 2002 meeting, it appears that Sheila and Suarez were also directed to submit explanations, hence, they submitted letters dated May 7, 2002 and May 8, 2002, respectively. [15]\n\nPetitioner, in compliance with respondent\u2019s May 7, 2002 memorandum, reiterated in writing his good intention behind the meeting and his denial of the charges against him.\n\nFinding petitioner\u2019s explanation unsatisfactory, respondent served upon him a letter dated May 9, 2002 dismissing him from employment effective immediately. [16]\n\nPetitioner thus filed on May 10, 2002 a complaint for illegal dismissal, non-payment of salaries and benefits, damages and attorney\u2019s fees. [17]\n\nLabor Arbiter Elias H. Salinas, by Decision of January 10, 2003, dismissed petitioner\u2019s complaint for lack of basis and merit.\u00a0 He, however, ordered respondent to pay him his pro rata 13th month pay for the year 2002 in the amount of P8,295.41.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of basis and merit.\u00a0 However, respondent Venutek Medika, Inc. is hereby ordered to pay complainant his pro rata 13 th month pay for the year 2002 in the amount of P8,295.41. [18] On appeal by petitioner, the NLRC, finding him to have been illegally dismissed, reversed and set aside the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Decision.\u00a0 Thus it disposed:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of Labor Arbiter Elias H. Salinas dated January 10, 2003, is hereby declared VACATED and SET ASIDE.\u00a0 Let another one (be) entered, declaring Complainant-Appellant ILLEGALLY DISMISSED.\u00a0 The Respondents are hereby directed to immediately REINSTATE Complainant-Appellant to his former position without loss of seniority rights, with full backwages, from the time of his illegal dismissal up to the finality of this Decision, and to pay his proportionate 13th month pay for the year 2002, the unpaid commission in the amount of P30,000.00,\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0plus 10% attorney\u2019s fees.\u00a0 It is however understood, that the Respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to Complainant-Appellant in case of monetary awards.\n\nSO ORDERED. [19] Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, respondent filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals, arguing that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in not finding that petitioner committed serious misconduct and willful breach of trust and confidence, as well as in awarding petitioner\u2019s monetary claims.\n\nThe Court of Appeals set aside the decision of the NLRC and reinstated that of the Labor Arbiter\u2019s.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the appellate court\u2019s decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED, and the assailed Decision and Resolution of the NLRC are hereby SET ASIDE.\u00a0 In lieu thereof, the Decision of Labor Arbiter Elias Salinas, finding that petitioner Venutek Medika, Inc. had legally dismissed the private respondent Teofilo Cesar N. Echeverria III although awarding him his pro rata 13 th month pay for the year 2002, is hereby REINSTATED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [20] Hence, the instant petition for review which raises the following issues:\na) Whether the Court of Appeals may review and set aside the findings of fact made by the NLRC; and\n\nb) Whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding that there is substantial evidence to support petitioner\u2019s dismissal. The petition fails.\n\nOn the first issue, it is settled that the Court of Appeals, in view of its expanded jurisdiction over labor cases which are elevated to it through a petition for certiorari, may look into the records of the case and re-examine the questioned findings if it considers the same to be necessary to arrive at a just decision; [21] and when factual findings of the NLRC are contrary to those of the Labor Arbiter, as in the present case. [22]\n\nOn the second issue, petitioner claims he is not guilty of serious misconduct, maintaining that the May 2, 2002 meeting was conducted with good intention and was approved by respondent through Sheila.\n\nFurther, petitioner contends that there was no substantial evidence that he made any derogatory remarks against Marlene as even respondent\u2019s witnesses did not state any such remarks attributed to him; that any remarks he made about Marlene were mere \u201cconstructive criticisms\u201d which were not meant to insult or offend her; \u00a0and the meeting was not work-related, hence, it may not be used by respondent to justify his dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s position fails.\n\nMisconduct has been defined as an improper or wrong conduct; a transgression of some established and definite rule of action; a forbidden act; a dereliction of duty.\u00a0 It implies wrongful intent and not mere error of judgment.\u00a0 To be categorized as serious, it must be of such grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial and unimportant.\u00a0 And to constitute just cause for an employee\u2019s separation, it must be in connection with his work. [23]\n\nTo justify the termination of an employee\u2019s services, loss of trust and confidence as basis thereof must be based on a willful breach of the trust reposed in him by his employer.\u00a0 Ordinary breach will not suffice.\n\nA breach of trust is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly and purposely without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. [24]\n\nAs correctly found by the Court of Appeals, there is substantial evidence of petitioner\u2019s misconduct, hence, it was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC to ignore the same.\u00a0 Thus the appellate court observed:\nThe records of the case are rife with proof that the private respondent committed acts which are inimical to the interests and stability, not only of management, but of the corporation itself.\u00a0 Private respondent did so, through devious and deceitful means and methods, aimed at sowing discord and instability among the officers of the petitioner Venutek, and discrediting top officers of the corporation, particularly the Assistant Vice President of Marketing, who is private respondent\u2019s superior in rank.\n\nIn the explanation (p. 45, Rollo) submitted by Sheila D. Vinuya , Assistant Regional Sales Manager, who was supposed to conduct the monthly cut-off meeting for the review of marketing and sales performance of the Dispophil group of companies, she recounted in detail that it was the private respondent who asked her if he could have a few minutes to discuss his vision and mission for the company and his \u201cwe are one\u201d idea.\u00a0 He told her that he would invite only other division heads.\u00a0 However, it turned out that he had invited other employees, not members of the marketing division, and not the division heads he referred to. . . [H]e took control of the meeting. . . [H]e also claimed that the meeting was with the blessings of the president of the company, but it later turned out that it was not. The result was confusion and demoralization among the employees, even to Vinuya herself, who felt used and betrayed. . .\n\nThe joint affidavit (p. 48, Rollo) executed by Vinuya, Lemford Suarez (Product Assistant), Mylene R. Brillantes (OIC Private Hospital Team), and Michelle C. Dizon (Assistant District Sales Manager), all mid-management officers like the private respondent, attested to the fact that private respondent made derogatory statements about Assistant Vice President Marlene Orozco . . .\n\nThese accounts of the persons present during the subject May 2, 2002 meeting are substantial proof of the grave infraction committed by the private respondent. . . . [25] (Underscoring supplied) The rule is well entrenched that substantial proof is sufficient as basis for the imposition of any disciplinary action upon an employee.\u00a0 The standard of substantial evidence is satisfied where the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee is responsible for the misconduct which renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position. [26]\n\nThe joint affidavit executed by Sheila Suarez, Mylene R. Brillantes and Michelle C. Dizon, managerial employees of respondent who attended the May 2, 2002 meeting, substantially proves the questioned statements of petitioner against one of his superiors:\n\nx x x x Mr. Echeverria made derogatory statements about one of the top ranking officials of the company, Asst. Vice President Marlene Orozco, which insulted her character, competency and performance.\u00a0 Mr. Echeverria insinuated that Mrs. Orozco doesn\u2019t have plans for the company for the year 2003.\u00a0 He even questioned her loyalty to the company by showing a purported document which allegedly shows that she sided with the former management of the corporation over the new management.\n\nHe further declared that Mrs. Orozco gave out promotions not on the basis of merits but rather on the basis of personality.\u00a0 As an example, he even referred to Mr. Winterson Razon and stated that Mrs. Orozco deferred his promotion because of the latter\u2019s lack of bearing, referring to his height. [27] (Underscoring supplied) That the utterance of obscene, insulting or offensive words against a superior constitutes gross misconduct, which is one of the grounds to terminate the services of an employee, is settled. [28]\n\nThe gravity of petitioner\u2019s misconduct is gathered from, inter alia, the following considerations: first, his misrepresentations to Sheila, the facilitator of the meeting, that he would only give a short discussion of his vision on corporate \u201coneness\u201d and he would invite the other division heads; second, his conscious and deliberate plan to give the questioned \u201cdiscussion\u201d as gathered from his preparation of slides and use of paraphernalia, even inviting other middle managers, not managers of the marketing division;\u00a0 and third, his false claim that he had the blessings of the president of the company to discuss his vision.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s actions no doubt demonstrate a clear disregard for the interests of the company which he, as a managerial employee, is supposed to safeguard.\n\nThat petitioner\u2019s actions constituted willful breach of trust cannot be gainsaid given his deliberate choice of an official and company-sanctioned meeting as the venue for uttering the questioned remarks against Marlene and the use of his position as assistant marketing manager to gain access to it.\n\nIt bears stressing that petitioner was not an ordinary rank-and-file employee.\u00a0 He was a managerial employee, which required the full trust and confidence of his employer in the exercise of discretion in overseeing respondent\u2019s business.\u00a0 As such, he was bound by more exacting work ethics.

NO. 138894, July 20, 2006 ]\n\nTHE HEIRS OF THE LATE PRESIDENT FERDINAND E. MARCOS, PETITIONERS, PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nTHE HEIRS OF THE LATE PRESIDENT FERDINAND E. MARCOS, PETITIONERS, PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPUNO, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review on certiorari filed pursuant to Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which seeks to reverse and set aside the resolution [1] of the Sandiganbayan dated February 15, 1999 which dismissed petitioners' complaint [2] in Civil Case No. 0183 for lack of jurisdiction due to their alleged failure and refusal to pay the correct amount of docket fees.\n\nThe antecedent facts are as follows:\n\nOn February 28, 1986, former President Corazon C. Aquino issued Executive Order No. 1 creating the respondent Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) as a collegial body to aid the government in the recovery of the ill-gotten wealth amassed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates, both here and abroad. To accomplish its objectives, the PCGG was granted vast powers including \"the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by . . . (President Marcos, his family and close associates) during his administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationship.\" [3]\n\nIn connection with these orders of sequestration, freezing or takeover, various civil actions for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution, and damages were instituted by the PCGG in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, against the persons believed to be owners or holders of the property subject thereof. One of them was former Ambassador Roberto S. Benedicto, an alleged crony of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was impleaded as a co-defendant in Sandiganbayan Civil Case Nos. 0009, 0024 and 0034.\n\nOn November 3, 1990, Benedicto and the Republic of the Philippines executed a compromise agreement before this Court whereby they settled their controversy in the aforementioned civil cases. Under the compromise agreement, Benedicto surrendered to the respondent PCGG 51% of his equity in Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (ETPI) consisting of 2,652,000 shares of stock which is equivalent to 10.2% of the total capital stock of ETPI.\n\nAlleging ownership over the aforementioned shares which were ceded by Benedicto to the respondent, the petitioners filed with the Sandiganbayan a complaint for declaration of ownership, accounting, and damages against the respondent PCGG on April 17, 1998, praying that the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos and/or his estate be declared the true and lawful owner of such shares, and for the respondent to render a full accounting of said shares, and to pay the petitioners Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos for moral damages, Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos for exemplary damages and Two Hundred Thousand (P200,000.00) Pesos for attorney's fees as well as the costs of the suit. The petitioners paid a filing fee of Four Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty (P4,850.00) Pesos.\n\nOn June 29, 1998, the respondent filed its answer [4] and the case was set for pre-trial on October 9, 1998. However, at the scheduled pre-trial conference, the Sandiganbayan held the proceedings in abeyance and invited the attention of the counsel for the petitioners regarding the lack of amount of filing fees paid invoking Section 7 of Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court, [5] Section 4 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7975 [6] and the doctrine laid down in the case of Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals [7] that the correct amount of filing fees must first be paid, otherwise the court concerned cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.\n\nOn October 14, 1998, the Sandiganbayan, in open court, issued an order [8] directing petitioners to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to their alleged nonpayment of the prescribed docket fee, more particularly the additional amount of One Million Three Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty-Five (P1,326,955.00) Pesos considering the prayer in the complaint that the ownership of the Two Million Six Hundred Fifty-Two Thousand (2,652,000) shares of stock of ETPI (with a par value of One Hundred [P100.00] Pesos per share) be judicially declared in favor of the petitioners.\n\nFollowing one request for extension, the petitioners filed their \"Response to Show Cause Order dated October 14, 1998,\" [9] on November 17, 1998, stating that the application of Section 7 of Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court in relation to Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975 would result in an unconstitutional diminution or modification of the petitioners' substantive rights under Section 11 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1606, [10] which, according to petitioners, had not been expressly nor impliedly repealed by R.A. Nos. 7975 and 8249, [11] which were two later amendatory laws to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Furthermore, they contend that even in the absence of any constitutional proscription, the Sandiganbayan is of the same level as the Court of Appeals, thus, Sections 4 and 5 [12] of Rule 141 should be applied as to the filing fees to be paid.\n\nOn February 15, 1999, the Sandiganbayan issued the assailed resolution dismissing Civil Case No. 0183 for lack of jurisdiction due to the failure of petitioners to pay the proper amount of filing fees. [13]\n\nThe petitioners filed their motion for reconsideration [14] on March 10, 1999, and after one request for extension, respondent through counsel filed its comment [15] on April 7, 1999.\n\nThe Sandiganbayan, in a resolution [16] dated May 24, 1999, denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration. Hence, this present petition where the petitioners submit that the Sandiganbayan, in dismissing the case, erred as follows:\nA.\n\nThe inference reached by the Sandiganbayan that the schedule of fees for Regional Trial Courts under Section 7 of Rule 141 applies or should be the one made to apply to it is not readily discernible in Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975.\n\nB.\n\nSection 4 of R.A. No. 7975 which makes the \"Rules of Court promulgated by the Supreme Court\" apply to all cases and proceedings filed with the Sandiganbayan\" would result in an unconstitutional application of Rule 141 or any section thereof for that matter.\n\nC.\n\nR.A. Nos. 7579 and 8249 did not expressly repeal Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606.\n\nD.\n\nSection 11 of P.D. No. 1606 covers even civil cases in light of its forthright and unambiguous terms.\n\nE.\n\nThere is no glaring inconsistency or repugnancy between Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606 and Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975 for the latter to be deemed to have impliedly repealed the former.\n\nF.\n\nEven in the absence of any constitutional proscription, it is not Section 7 in particular of Rule 141 as to the legal fees payable to Regional Trial Courts which will apply to all cases or proceedings, civil or criminal, before the Sandiganbayan, but Sections 4 and 5 thereof as to the legal fees payable to the Court of Appeals as the latter and the Sandiganbayan are \"of the same level.\"\n\nG.\n\nNo less than the Honorable Court and recent legislation recognize that both the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan are \"of the same level.\"\nAs can be culled from the aforementioned assignment of errors, the main issue submitted to this Court for resolution is whether the Sandiganbayan erred in dismissing petitioners' complaint for failure to pay the correct filing fees.\n\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\n\nIn the 2000 case of Yuchengco v. Republic of the Philippines, et al., [17] wherein petitioner Yuchengco assailed the Sandiganbayan resolution dismissing his amended complaint-in-intervention for failure to pay the proper docket fee on time, this Court stressed the rule that parties filing civil actions before the Sandiganbayan are liable to pay the required docket fees. We ruled:\n\" petitioner's position that subsequent amendments to PD 1606 did not expressly repeal Section 11 thereof is untenable. Petitioner failed to appreciate that the expansion of the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction to include civil cases impliedly amended the same and Section 1, Rule IV, Part I of the Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan. Moreover, the Supreme Court enjoys exclusive power to promulgate the rules on pleading, practice, and procedure.\n\nIn addition, Republic Act No. 7975 amended Section 9 of P.D. 1606 to read as follows:\nRules of Procedure. - The Rules of Court promulgated by the Supreme Court shall apply to all cases and proceedings filed with the Sandiganbayan. . . .\nHence, Rule 141 Section 7(a) of the Rules of Court applies to petitioner's complaint and/or amended complaints-in-intervention.\nWhen P.D. No. 1606 and Section 11 thereof, which provides that all proceedings in the Sandiganbayan shall be conducted at no cost to the complainant, were issued on December 10, 1978, the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan was limited to criminal actions. Since then, R.A. Nos. 7975 and 8249 have expanded the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan to include civil cases and resultantly, Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606 should be deemed impliedly amended by the said laws. Thus, Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court on Legal Fees must now be observed by parties filing civil actions before the Sandiganbayan.\n\nWe also reject petitioners' contention that Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court on the legal fees payable to the Court of Appeals should apply to the Sandiganbayan, because they are of the same level. Although it could be argued that the Sandiganbayan is of the same level as the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan performs the functions of a trial court and its limited and exclusive appellate jurisdiction covers only appeals from the final judgments, resolutions or orders of regional trial courts where all the accused are occupying positions lower than salary grade 27 or not otherwise covered by the enumeration of certain public officers in Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606 as amended by R.A. No. 8249. Since the cognizance of the present case by the Sandiganbayan is in the exercise of its function as a trial court and not of its appellate function, it is Section 7 of Rule 141 that should apply as to the legal fees to be paid.\n\nThere is another reason why the petition must fail. In the case of S un Insurance Office Ltd. v. Hon. Maximiano Asuncion, [18] the Court en banc laid down the following rules as regards the payment of filing fees:\nIt is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but [also] the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject-matter or nature of the action. Where the filing of the initiatory pleading is not accompanied by payment of the docket fee, the court may allow payment of the fee within a reasonable time but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.\n\nThe same rule applies to permissive counterclaims, third-party claims and similar pleadings, which shall not be considered filed until and unless the filing fee prescribed therefor is paid. The court may also allow payment of said fee within a reasonable time but also in no case beyond its applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.\n\nWhere the trial court acquires jurisdiction over a claim by the filing of the appropriate pleading and payment of the prescribed filing fee but, subsequently, the judgment awards a claim not specified in the pleading, or if specified the same has been left for determination by the court, the additional filing fee therefor shall constitute a lien on the judgment. It shall be the responsibility of the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized deputy to enforce said lien and assess and collect the additional fee. The rule is clear. It is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but also the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests the trial court with jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action. [19] Payment within \"a reasonable time\" of the prescribed filing fees may be granted by the courts upon equitable considerations but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period. Since the petitioners in the case at bar seek to recover shares of stock, the ownership and possession of which they have been allegedly wrongfully deprived, assuming hypothetically this averment to be true, the legal relationship of constructive trust was present among the parties concerned.\n\nA constructive trust, otherwise known as an implied trust, is a trust by operation of law which arises contrary to intention and in invitum , against one who, by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of wrong, or by any form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or who in any way against equity and good conscience, either has obtained or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy. [20] It is a resulting obligation created by law and actions thereon prescribe after ten (10) years as provided by Article 1144 of the Civil Code. [21]\n\nIn the instant case, even if we consider the petitioners' right of action for recovery of the shares as having accrued only on November 3, 1990, when Benedicto entered into a compromise agreement with the Republic of the Philippines surrendering the shares in question, or even on the latter period of September 10, 1993, wherein this Court upheld the validity of the compromise agreement, the ten (10)-year prescriptive period has already elapsed. The petitioners, through their belated filing of numerous motions of extensions to file their reply instead of manifesting a willingness to abide by the ruling of the Sandiganbayan on the proper docket fees to be paid, have clearly slept on their rights. Prescription has already set in, thereby barring their right of action.\n\nIN VIEW WHEREOF , the petition is DENIED .

This Court upholds the finding and recommendation of the IBP.In failing to comply with the requirements in initiating complainant's appeal before this Court in G.R.

It need not be underlined that a lawyer who accepts a case must give it his full attention, diligence, skill, and competence,[8] and his negligence in connection therewith renders him liable.[9] The circumstances attendant to respondent's initial handle of Lea's case do not warrant a finding of gross negligence, or sheer absence of real effort on his part to defend her cause.[10] Respondent accepted Lea's case upon her mother's insistence, with only six days for him to file a petition for review before this Court, and without her furnishing him with complete records, not to mention money, for the reproduction of the needed documents. Despite these constraints, respondent exerted efforts, albeit lacking in care, to defend his client's cause by filing two motions for extension of time to file petition.

Court of Appeals ,\" by Resolution dated February 3, 1992, reading: Acting on the pleadings filed in this case, the Court resolved: to DENY: (a) petitioner's second motion for extension of time to file petition for review on certiorari, as petitioner's first motion for extension was denied in the resolution of December 16, 1991 for failure to comply with the requirement of No. two (2) of Revised Circular 1-88. Moreover, the said second motion for extension still fails to comply with the same requirement of Revised Circular 1-88, and (b) the petition itself, for having been filed late and for failure to comply with requirement No. four (4) of Revised Circular 1-88, and for failure to submit the certification required under Circular 28-91 on forum shopping.

ELADIO ABQUINA, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. FE MABALOT, CLERK OF COURT, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 63, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENT. R E S O L U T I O N\nMIKROSTAR INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, REPRESENTED BY ATTY. ELADIO ABQUINA, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. FE MABALOT, CLERK OF COURT, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 63, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nThe instant administrative case refers to the charges of failing to act promptly on letters and requests under Sections 5(a) and 11 of Republic Act No. 6713 [1] against Fe Mabalot, Branch Clerk of Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 63, Makati City, relative to Civil Case No. 76271 for sum of money.\n\nAtty. Eladio B. Abquina, Jr., the legal counsel of Mikrostar Industrial Corporation, the plaintiff in the said case, sent an unverified Letter dated July 7, 2004 addressed to the respondent, stating as follows:\nI personally sent you two (2) letters. In the first letter, dated May 7, 2004, I was asking if the Decision, dated January 27, 2003, and Order dated May 26, 2004, have gained finality. Unfortunately, you have not answered the said May 7, 2004 letter. \u00a0The second letter was a follow-up letter dated June 2, 2004 to the May 7, 2004 letter. Unfortunately, despite receipt of the said June 2, 2004 letter by personal service, you opted not to answer my letter.\n\nOn June 28, 2004, I sent Mr. Era\u00f1o S. Reyes, my paralegal officer to your office to inquire if there is already a response to my queries. According to my paralegal officer, he accidentally met you at the hallway somewhere at your office and you told him: \"pasulat-sulat pa kayo, ang yayabang n'yo.\"\n\nAccording to my secretary, Ms. Maricel Galima, you called up my office and advised us to file a motion for the issuance of writ of execution with attached affidavit of proof of personal service upon the defendant. You also told my secretary that the motion will be set for hearing on August 2004, after which the motion will be granted. You also told my secretary that \"nayayabangan ka at naaantipatikuhan kay Era\u00f1o Reyes.\" As regards your accusation against my paralegal officer, I have directed him to formally comment on this.\n\nNow going back to my letters, I'm terribly upset that to date you have not answered my letter. With due respect, how can I prove to the Court as to how and when the decision gained finality when you have not answered my letter/query? [2] The letter was forwarded to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), and referred to the respondent for Comment. The respondent denied the allegations, but admitted having met Era\u00f1o S. Reyes when the latter requested for a certificate of finality of decision. She replied that first level courts do not issue such a certificate as there are still remedies available in the Regional Trial Court (RTC). Nonetheless, she instructed the clerk in charge to look for the mailing return card and, because of the heavy workload during that time, asked Reyes to come back after a week. As she did not find a return card, she resorted to the mailing list and found that only the court Order dated September 29, 2003 was mailed on October 7, 2003. This information was relayed to Reyes, who then wrote a letter requesting the Makati Post Office to issue a certification that such court order was mailed to the defendant's counsel.\n\nAccording to the respondent, Reyes was uncivilized and arrogant with his dealings with the court, and even threatened that his employer, Atty. Abquina, would report her to the Ombudsman if she did not comply with the letter. The respondent admitted, however, that she called up the complainant's secretary as instructed by her presiding judge, who was also annoyed by Reyes' arrogant and uncivilized attitude. She relayed through telephone that the complainant could file a motion for execution even without proof of receipt of the order. She claimed that she pointed out the provisions of Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, and that there had also been partial execution after the previous payments had been deducted in the Order dated May 26, 2003.\n\nThe respondent, likewise, assailed the grandstanding of the complainant instead of filing the necessary motion in court. She claims that instead of protecting and prioritizing his client's interest, the complainant harassed court employees, an act unbecoming of an officer of the court and a violation of Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Ethics. She also disclosed that she was furnishing a copy to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Committee on Discipline for evaluation if the complainant may be subjected to disciplinary action.\n\nIn its Report [3] dated March 17, 2005, the OCA recommended that the instant administrative complaint be dismissed for lack of merit, considering that the complainant failed to show that the respondent was motivated by fraud, dishonesty or corrupt motive. Moreover, the respondent was not remiss in her duty to observe what was incumbent upon her in answering queries of parties-litigants.\n\nThe case was, thereafter, referred to Executive Judge Rowena De Juan-Quinagoran, RTC, Makati City, for investigation, report and recommendation. [4] Despite due notice, however, the complainant failed to appear during the hearing dates.\n\nIn her Investigation Report and Recommendation dated September 29, 2005, the Executive Judge agreed with the OCA that the respondent was not remiss in the performance of her duty, considering that she responded to the complainant's letters through telephone calls, a common practice in courts. The Executive Judge also ruled that there was no basis to support the complainant's allegation that the respondent made the utterances attributed to her. It was then recommended that the case be dismissed for lack of merit and insufficiency of evidence. The Executive Judge opined, however, that the respondent should be warned or admonished to be more efficient in the performance of her official function as Branch Clerk of Court.\n\nThe Court agrees that the respondent should not be held administratively liable in this instance. It is settled that in administrative proceedings, the burden of substantiating the charges asseverated in the complaint falls on the complainant. [5] The allegations in the complaint must be proven with substantial evidence. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption that the respondent regularly performed his or her duties will prevail. Even in administrative cases, if a court employee is to be disciplined for a grave offense, the evidence against him or her should be competent and should be derived from direct knowledge. [6] Reliance on mere allegations, conjectures and suppositions will leave an administrative complaint with no leg to stand on. Charges based on mere suspicion and speculation cannot be given credence. [7]\n\nIn this case, the complainant failed to substantiate the charges against the respondent. In fact, no representative from the corporation appeared during the investigation, nor was there an attempt to present any affidavit to support the allegations in the complaint.\n\nHowever, as found by the Executive Judge:\n[D]uring the hearing on September 8, 2005, respondent admitted that the casual employee assigned in the mailing failed to send a copy of the Order to the defendant ( TSN, dated September 8, 2005, page 11 ). Thus, the undersigned finds that she committed an infraction in the performance of her official functions. She should see to it that copies of orders, decision and communication are properly [sent] to the parties and counsel. [8] The respondent should forthwith be reminded that as a clerk of court, she is an essential and ranking officer of our judicial system who performs delicate administrative functions vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice, [9] and that any conduct which tends to diminish the image of the Judiciary will not be countenanced. Moreover, court personnel are exhorted to at all times perform official duties properly and with diligence, and to carry out their responsibilities as public servants in as courteous a manner as possible. [10] It is only in this way that the integrity and the good name of the courts of justice shall be preserved.\n\nWHEREFORE, the charges against Fe Mabalot are DISMISSED for lack of merit. She is ADMONISHED to be more circumspect in the performance of her duties.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Tinga, and Chico-Nazario, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Otherwise known as an \"Act Establishing a Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, to Uphold the Time-Honored Principle of Public Office being a Public Trust, Granting Incentives and Rewards for Exemplary Service, Enumerating Prohibited Acts and Transactions and Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof and for Other Purposes.\"\n\n[2] Rollo, pp. 5-6.\n\n[3] Id. at 1-4.\n\n[4] Id. at 22.\n\n[5] Cortes v.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nESMERALDO RIVERA, ISMAEL RIVERA, EDGARDO RIVERA, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 27215 affirming, with modification, the Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cavite, Branch 90, in Criminal Case No. 6962-99, entitled People of the Philippines. v. Esmeraldo Rivera, et al.\n\nOn April 12, 1999, an Information was filed in the RTC of Imus, Cavite, charging Esmeraldo, Ismael and Edgardo, all surnamed Rivera, of attempted murder. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:\nThat on or about the 3rd day of May 1998, in the Municipality of Dasmari\u00f1as, Province of Cavite, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault and hit with a piece of hollow block, one RUBEN RODIL who thereby sustained a non-mortal injury on his head and on the different parts of his body, the accused thus commenced the commission of the felony directly by overt acts, but failed to perform all the acts of execution which would produce the crime of Murder by reason of some causes other than their own spontaneous desistance, that is, the said Ruben Rodil was able to ran (sic) away and the timely response of the policemen, to his damage and prejudice.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [3] Ruben Rodil testified that he used to work as a taxi driver. He stopped driving in April 1998 after a would-be rapist threatened his life. He was even given a citation as a Bayaning Pilipino by the television network ABS-CBN for saving the would-be victim. His wife eked out a living as a manicurist. They and their three children resided in Barangay San Isidro Labrador II, Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, near the house of Esmeraldo Rivera and his brothers Ismael and Edgardo.\n\nAt noon of May 2, 1998, Ruben went to a nearby store to buy food. Edgardo mocked him for being jobless and dependent on his wife for support. Ruben resented the rebuke and hurled invectives at Edgardo. A heated exchange of words ensued.\n\nAt about 7:30 p.m. the next day, a Sunday, Ruben went to the store to buy food and to look for his wife. His three-year-old daughter was with him. Momentarily, Esmeraldo and his two brothers, Ismael and Edgardo, emerged from their house and ganged up on Ruben. Esmeraldo and Ismael mauled Ruben with fist blows and he fell to the ground. In that helpless position, Edgardo hit Ruben three times with a hollow block on the parietal area. Esmeraldo and Ismael continued mauling Ruben. People who saw the incident shouted: \" Awatin sila! Awatin sila! \" Ruben felt dizzy but managed to stand up. Ismael threw a stone at him, hitting him at the back. When policemen on board a mobile car arrived, Esmeraldo, Ismael and Edgardo fled to their house.\n\nRuben was brought to the hospital. His attending physician, Dr. Lamberto Cagingin, Jr., signed a medical certificate in which he declared that Ruben sustained lacerated wounds on the parietal area, cerebral concussion or contusion, hematoma on the left upper buttocks, multiple abrasions on the left shoulder and hematoma periorbital left. [4] The doctor declared that the lacerated wound in the parietal area was slight and superficial and would heal from one to seven days. [5] The doctor prescribed medicine for Ruben's back pain, which he had to take for one month. [6]\n\nEsmeraldo testified that at around 1:00 p.m. on May 3, 1998, Ruben arrived at his house and banged the gate. Ruben challenged him and his brothers to come out and fight. When he went out of the house and talked to Ruben, the latter punched him. They wrestled with each other. He fell to the ground. Edgardo arrived and pushed Ruben aside. His wife arrived, and he was pulled away and brought to their house.\n\nFor his part, Ismael testified that he tried to pacify Ruben and his brother Esmeraldo, but Ruben grabbed him by the hair. He managed to free himself from Ruben and the latter fled. He went home afterwards. He did not see his brother Edgardo at the scene.\n\nEdgardo declared that at about 1:00 p.m. on May 3, 1998, he was throwing garbage in front of their house. Ruben arrived and he went inside the house to avoid a confrontation. Ruben banged the gate and ordered him to get out of their house and even threatened to shoot him. His brother Esmeraldo went out of their house and asked Ruben what the problem was.\nA fist fight ensued. Edgardo rushed out of the house and pushed Ruben aside. Ruben fell to the ground. When he stood up, he pulled at Edgardo's shirt and hair, and, in the process, Ruben's head hit the lamp post. [7]\n\nOn August 30, 2002, the trial court rendered judgment finding all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of frustrated murder. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, all the accused are found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt and are sentenced to an imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) day to eight (8) years of prision mayor as the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the culpability of the accused. Likewise, the accused are to pay, jointly and severally, civil indemnity to the private complainant in the amount of P30,000.00.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8] The trial court gave no credence to the collective testimonies of the accused and their witnesses. The accused appealed to the CA, which rendered judgment on June 8, 2004 affirming, with modification, the appealed decision. The dispositive portion of the CA decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite, Branch 90, is MODIFIED in that the appellants are convicted of ATTEMPTED MURDER and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 2 years of prision correccional as minimum to 6 years and 1 day of prision mayor as maximum. In all other respects, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [9] The accused, now petitioners, filed the instant petition for review on certiorari, alleging that the CA erred in affirming the RTC decision. They insist that the prosecution failed to prove that they had the intention to kill Ruben when they mauled and hit him with a hollow block. Petitioners aver that, based on the testimony of Dr. Cagingin, Ruben sustained only a superficial wound in the parietal area; hence, they should be held criminally liable for physical injuries only. Even if petitioners had the intent to kill Ruben, the prosecution failed to prove treachery; hence, they should be held guilty only of attempted homicide.\n\nOn the other hand, the CA held that the prosecution was able to prove petitioners' intent to kill Ruben:\nOn the first assigned error, intent to kill may be deduced from the nature of the wound inflicted and the kind of weapon used. Intent to kill was established by victim Ruben Rodil in his testimony as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | And while you were being boxed by Esmeraldo and Bong, what happened next?\nA: | When I was already lying [down] xxx, Dagol Rivera showed up with a piece of hollow block xxx and hit me thrice on the head, Sir.\n | \nQ: | And what about the two (2), what were they doing when you were hit with a hollow block by Dagol?\nA: | I was already lying on the ground and they kept on boxing me while Dagol was hitting, Sir.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: And while you were being boxed by Esmeraldo and Bong, what happened next? A: When I was already lying [down] xxx, Dagol Rivera showed up with a piece of hollow block xxx and hit me thrice on the head, Sir.\n\nQ: And what about the two (2), what were they doing when you were hit with a hollow block by Dagol? A: I was already lying on the ground and they kept on boxing me while Dagol was hitting, Sir.\nAs earlier stated by Dr. Cagingin, appellants could have killed the victim had the hollow block directly hit his head, and had the police not promptly intervened so that the brothers scampered away. When a wound is not sufficient to cause death, but intent to kill is evident, the crime is attempted. Intent to kill was shown by the fact that the (3) brothers helped each other maul the defenseless victim, and even after he had already fallen to the ground; that one of them even picked up a cement hollow block and proceeded to hit the victim on the head with it three times; and that it was only the arrival of the policemen that made the appellants desist from their concerted act of trying to kill Ruben Rodil. [10] The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for its part, asserts that the decision of the CA is correct, thus:\nThe evidence and testimonies of the prosecution witnesses defeat the presumption of innocence raised by petitioners. The crime has been clearly established with petitioners as the perpetrators. Their intent to kill is very evident and was established beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nEyewitnesses to the crime, Alicia Vera Cruz and Lucita Villejo clearly and categorically declared that the victim Ruben Rodil was walking along St. Peter Avenue when he was suddenly boxed by Esmeraldo \"Baby\" Rivera. They further narrated that, soon thereafter, his two brothers Ismael and Edgardo \"Dagul\" Rivera, coming from St. Peter II, ganged up on the victim. Both Alicia Vera Cruz and Lucita Villejo recounted that they saw Edgardo \"Dagul\" Rivera pick up a hollow block and hit Ruben Rodil with it three (3) times. A careful review of their testimonies revealed the suddenness and unexpectedness of the attack of petitioners. In this case, the victim did not even have the slightest warning of the danger that lay ahead as he was carrying his three-year old daughter. He was caught off-guard by the assault of Esmeraldo \"Baby\" Rivera and the simultaneous attack of the two other petitioners. It was also established that the victim was hit by Edgardo \"Dagul\" Rivera, while he was lying on the ground and being mauled by the other petitioners. Petitioners could have killed the victim had he not managed to escape and had the police not promptly intervened.\n\nPetitioners also draw attention to the fact that the injury sustained by the victim was superficial and, thus, not life threatening. The nature of the injury does not negate the intent to kill. The Court of Appeals held:\nAs earlier stated by Dr. Cagingin, appellants could have killed the victim had the hollow block directly hit his head, and had the police not promptly intervened so that the brothers scampered away. When a wound is not sufficient to cause death, but intent to kill is evident, the crime is attempted. Intent to kill was shown by the fact that the three (3) brothers helped each other maul the defenseless victim, and even after he had already fallen to the ground; that one of them picked up a cement hollow block and proceeded to hit the victim on the head with it three times; and that it was only the arrival of the policemen that made the appellants desist from their concerted act of trying to kill Ruben Rodil. [11] The petition is denied for lack of merit.\n\nAn essential element of murder and homicide, whether in their consummated, frustrated or attempted stage, is intent of the offenders to kill the victim immediately before or simultaneously with the infliction of injuries. Intent to kill is a specific intent which the prosecution must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence, while general criminal intent is presumed from the commission of a felony by dolo .\n\nIn People v. Delim, [12] the Court declared that evidence to prove intent to kill in crimes against persons may consist, inter alia, in the means used by the malefactors, the nature, location and number of wounds sustained by the\nvictim, the conduct of the malefactors before, at the time, or immediately after the killing of the victim, the circumstances under which the crime was committed and the motives of the accused. If the victim dies as a result of a deliberate act of the malefactors, intent to kill is presumed.\n\nIn the present case, the prosecution mustered the requisite quantum of evidence to prove the intent of petitioners to kill Ruben. Esmeraldo and Ismael pummeled the victim with fist blows. Even as Ruben fell to the ground, unable to defend himself against the sudden and sustained assault of petitioners, Edgardo hit him three times with a hollow block. Edgardo tried to hit Ruben on the head, missed, but still managed to hit the victim only in the parietal area, resulting in a lacerated wound and cerebral contusions.\n\nThat the head wounds sustained by the victim were merely superficial and could not have produced his death does not negate petitioners' criminal liability for attempted murder. Even if Edgardo did not hit the victim squarely on the head, petitioners are still criminally liable for attempted murder.\n\nThe last paragraph of Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code defines an attempt to commit a felony, thus:\nThere is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance. The essential elements of an attempted felony are as follows:\nThe offender commences the commission of the felony directly by overt acts;\n\nHe does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony;\n\nThe offender's act be not stopped by his own spontaneous desistance;\n\nThe non-performance of all acts of execution was due to cause or accident other than his spontaneous desistance. [13] The first requisite of an attempted felony consists of two elements, namely:\n(1) That there be external acts;\n\n(2) Such external acts have direct connection with the crime intended to be committed. [14] The Court in People v. Lizada [15] elaborated on the concept of an overt or external act, thus:\nAn overt or external act is defined as some physical activity or deed, indicating the intention to commit a particular crime, more than a mere planning or preparation, which if carried out to its complete termination following its natural course, without being frustrated by external obstacles nor by the spontaneous desistance of the perpetrator, will logically and necessarily ripen into a concrete offense. The raison d'etre for the law requiring a direct overt act is that, in a majority of cases, the conduct of the accused consisting merely of acts of preparation has never ceased to be equivocal; and this is necessarily so, irrespective of his declared intent. It is that quality of being equivocal that must be lacking before the act becomes one which may be said to be a commencement of the commission of the crime, or an overt act or before any fragment of the crime itself has been committed, and this is so for the reason that so long as the equivocal quality remains, no one can say with certainty what the intent of the accused is. It is necessary that the overt act should have been the ultimate step towards the consummation of the design. It is sufficient if it was the \"first or some subsequent step in a direct movement towards the commission of the offense after the preparations are made.\" The act done need not constitute the last proximate one for completion. It is necessary, however, that the attempt must have a causal relation to the intended crime. In the words of Viada, the overt acts must have an immediate and necessary relation to the offense. [16]\nIn the case at bar, petitioners, who acted in concert, commenced the felony of murder by mauling the victim and hitting him three times with a hollow block; they narrowly missed hitting the middle portion of his head. If Edgardo had done so, Ruben would surely have died.\n\nWe reject petitioners' contention that the prosecution failed to prove treachery in the commission of the felony. Petitioners attacked the victim in a sudden and unexpected manner as Ruben was walking with his three-year-old daughter, impervious of the imminent peril to his life. He had no chance to defend himself and retaliate. He was overwhelmed by the synchronized assault of the three siblings. The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack on the victim. [17] Even if the attack is frontal but is sudden and unexpected, giving no opportunity for the victim to repel it or defend himself, there would be treachery. [18] Obviously, petitioners assaulted the victim because of the altercation between him and petitioner Edgardo Rivera a day before. There being conspiracy by and among petitioners, treachery is considered against all of them. [19]\n\nThe appellate court sentenced petitioners to suffer an indeterminate penalty of two (2) years of prision correccional in its minimum period, as minimum, to six years and one day of prision mayor in its maximum period, as maximum. This is erroneous. Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the penalty for murder is reclusion perpetua to death. Since petitioners are guilty only of attempted murder, the penalty should be reduced by two degrees, conformably to Article 51 of the Revised Penal Code. Under paragraph 2 of Article 61, in relation to Article 71 of the Revised Penal Code, such a penalty is prision mayor. In the absence of any modifying circumstance in the commission of the felony (other than the qualifying circumstance of treachery), the maximum of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the medium period of prision mayor which has a range of from eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years. To determine the minimum of the indeterminate penalty, the penalty of prision mayor should be reduced by one degree, prision correccional, which has a range of six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.\n\nHence, petitioners should be sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from two (2) years of prision correccional in its minimum period, as minimum, to nine (9) years and four (4) months of prision mayor in its medium period, as maximum.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED WITH THE MODIFICATION that petitioners are sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from two (2) years of prision correccional in its minimum period, as minimum, to nine (9) years and four (4) months of prision mayor in its medium period, as maximum.

[1]\n\nThe assailed Order was issued by the RTC after it rendered a favorable judgment on respondent's application for registration in its Decision dated November 3, 1998, and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-10053 was issued in her name covering a parcel of land described as follows:\nA parcel of land (Plan Psu-224228, LR Case No. N-04-0-97, LRA Record No. N-68955), situated in the Barrio of Barretto, Municipality of Olongapo, Province of Zambales, Island of Luzon, Bounded on the NW., points 1-3 by Road (6.00 m. wide) (unimproved); on the NE., points 3-4 by Public Land claimed by C. Panaligan; on the E., SE., and SW., points 4-19 by Makinaya River (10.00 m. wide); on the SW., points 19-29 by Public Land; and on the NW., points 29-1 by Road (6.00 m. wide) unimproved.\u00a0 Beginning at a point marked \"1\" on plan, being S.84 deg. 47'E., 2644.65 m. from B.L.B.M. 2, Barrio of Matain, Subic, Zambales, thence\n\nx x x x\n\nbeginning; containing an area of TWENTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE (20, 149) SQUARE METERS, more or less.\u00a0 x x x [2] Petitioners opposed respondent's application for the issuance of a writ of possession claiming that they were not oppositors/parties to the registration case and they have been in actual physical possession of the property since 1964. The RTC, however, rejected their arguments and granted respondent's application for the issuance of a writ of possession per herein assailed Order.\n\nHence, the present petition.\n\nPetitioners set forth the lone assignment of error that the RTC erred in issuing the writ of possession and acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and excess of jurisdiction. [3] Petitioners reiterate their argument that they cannot be ousted of their possession of the property, having been in actual possession of the property since 1964, as evidenced by petitioner Gerardo C. Mendoza's Sales Application made in January 1986 over the following property:\nA parcel of land situated at Burgos St., Bo. Barretto, O.C.\u00a0 Bounded on the North., by Benjamin Salinas; South., by Gloria Montemayor; East., by Benjamin Salinas & Conrado Pilapil and West., Burgos St. situated in Bo. Barretto, Olongapo City, Zambales, and containing an area of 932 square meters x x x. [4] and a Declaration of Real Property for the years 1976 and 1985, [5] among others.\n\nRespondent counters that the present petition should be dismissed, arguing that the petition should have been initially with the Court of Appeals, based on the principle of hierarchy of courts, and that the general order of default on October 8, 1998 issued by the RTC binds them and personal notice was not necessary.\n\nThe petition must be granted.\n\nOn the procedural issue, it should be pointed out that what petitioners filed with the Court is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of Court, and not a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65.\u00a0 The principle of hierarchy of courts does not find any application in this case. Under Section 2(c), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it is provided that in all cases where only questions of law are raised, the appeal from a decision or order of the RTC shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with Rule 45, Section 1 of which provides:\nSECTION 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court. - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari . The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. A question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of facts being admitted. A question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, as well as their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probability of the situation. [6]\n\nThe substantive issue posed for resolution in the present case pertains to the propriety of the issuance of the writ of possession by the RTC.\u00a0 This, obviously, is a question of law; consequently, direct resort to this Court is proper.\n\nThere is no question that the writ of possession granted in this case was made by the RTC acting as a land registration court, after finality of its Decision dated November 3, 1998 and the corresponding OCT No. P-10053 was issued in the name of respondent. As the soundness of the order granting the writ of possession is a matter of judgment, the remedy is ordinary appeal by way of petition for review on certiorari . An error of judgment committed by a court in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction is not the same as \"grave abuse of discretion.\" Errors of judgment are correctible by appeal, while those of jurisdiction are reviewable by certiorari . [7]\n\nPetitioners, therefore, filed the proper petition before the Court.\n\nOn the substantive issue of the propriety of the issuance of the writ of possession, the Court finds that the RTC committed a reversible error in granting the issuance of the writ of possession.\n\nA writ of possession may be issued under the following instances: (1) land registration proceedings under Sec. 17 of Act No. 496; (2) judicial foreclosure, provided the debtor is in possession of the mortgaged realty and no third person, not a party to the foreclosure suit, had intervened; and (3) extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage under Sec. 7 of Act No. 3135 as amended by Act No. 4118.\n\nIn land registration cases, principles regarding the issuance of a writ of possession are well-settled.\u00a0 A judgment confirming the title of the applicant in a registration case and ordering its registration in his name necessarily carries with it the delivery of possession which is an inherent element of the right of ownership. [8] This is sanctioned by existing laws in this jurisdiction and by the generally accepted principle upon which the administration of justice rests. [9]\n\nAlso, a writ of possession may be issued not only against the person who has been defeated in a registration case but also against anyone unlawfully and adversely occupying the land or any portion thereof during the land registration proceedings up to the issuance of the final decree, [10] and it is the duty of the registration court to issue said writ when asked for by the successful claimant. [11]\n\nBased on these tenets, the issuance of a writ of possession, therefore, is clearly a ministerial duty of the land registration court.\u00a0 Such ministerial duty, however, ceases to be so with particular regard to petitioners who are actual possessors of the property under a claim of ownership.\u00a0 Actual possession under claim of ownership raises a disputable presumption of ownership.\u00a0 This conclusion is supported by Article 433 of the Civil Code, which provides:\nActual possession under claim of ownership raises a disputable presumption of ownership. The true owner must resort to judicial process for the recovery of the property. Under said provision, one who claims to be the owner of a property possessed by another must bring the appropriate judicial action for its physical recovery. The term \"judicial process\" could mean no less than an ejectment suit or reinvindicatory action, in which the ownership claims of the contending parties may be properly heard and adjudicated. [12]\n\nIt is noted that there already exists a final and executory decision disregarding respondent's claim for possession over the property.\u00a0 In a Decision dated January 21, 2002, rendered by the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Olongapo City, Branch 3, in Civil Case No. 4643, an action for unlawful detainer filed by respondent and her spouse against petitioners and several other occupants of the property, the case against petitioners was dismissed by the MTCC for lack of cause of action. [13] While the MTCC Decision was appealed\u00a0 by the other defendants, respondent and her spouse manifested that they will not appeal the decision and, instead, will file for a writ of possession in\u00a0 LRC Case No. N-04-0-97.\n\nNote should also be made that petitioners registered their opposition to respondent's application for the issuance of a writ of possession and apprised the RTC of their actual, peaceful, physical and uninterrupted possession since 1964, [14] including therein documents supporting their claim, consisting of Gerardo C. Mendoza's Sales Application made on January 1986 and a Declaration of Real Property for the years 1976 and 1985, among others. [15] The RTC, nevertheless, disregarded their opposition and, instead, relied on the ruling in Serra Serra v. Court of Appeals [195 SCRA 482], [16] that a writ of possession may be issued in a land registration proceeding.\n\nA reading of the Serra Serra case , however, supports the Court's conclusion that a writ of possession should not have been issued in this case.\u00a0 It was ruled by the Court that while a writ of possession may be issued only pursuant to a decree of registration in an original land registration proceedings, it cannot issue against possessors under claim of ownership, as actual possession under claim of ownership raises a disputable presumption of ownership, and the true owner must resort to judicial process for the recovery of the property, not summarily through\u00a0 a motion for the issuance of a writ of possession. [17]\n\nThus, it was erroneous for the RTC to have issued the writ of possession against petitioners.\u00a0 This conclusion, of course, is without prejudice to any case that respondent may file for the recovery of the property.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED .\u00a0 The\u00a0 Order dated April 2, 2002 issued by the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, Branch 72, acting as Land Registration Court, in LRC Case No. N-04-0-97, is NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE . Respondent's application for the issuance of a writ of possession is DENIED , without prejudice to any case that she may file for recovery of the property.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 57.\n\n[2] Records, pp. 119-120.\n\n[3] Rollo, p. 7.\n\n[4] Id. at 19.\n\n[5] Id. at 21, 22.\n\n[6] Bukidnon Doctors' Hospital, Inc. v.

NO. 161654, May 05, 2006 ]\n\nDUSIT HOTEL NIKKO, PETITIONER, VS. RENATO M. GATBONTON, RESPONDENT.DECISION\nDUSIT HOTEL NIKKO, PETITIONER, VS. RENATO M. GATBONTON, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review of the Decision [1] dated September 22, 2003, and the Resolution [2] dated January 9, 2004, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 73296, which reversed the Resolution [3] dated September 24, 2001, of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC CA No. 025743-00.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\nOn November 21, 1998, [4] respondent Renato M. Gatbonton was hired as Chief Steward in petitioner Dusit Hotel Nikko's Food and Beverage Department. He signed a three-month probationary employment contract until February 21, 1999, [5] with a monthly salary of P25,000. At the start of his employment, the standards by which he would be assessed to qualify for regular employment were explained to him.\n\nThe hotel alleged that at the end of the probation period, Ingo Rauber, Director of its Food and Beverage Department, observed that Gatbonton failed to meet the qualification standards for Chief Steward, and Rauber recommended a two-month extension of Gatbonton's probationary period, or until April 22, 1999. At the end of the 4th month, on March 24, 1999, Rauber informed Gatbonton that the latter had poor ratings on staff supervision, productivity, quantity of work, and overall efficiency and did not qualify as Chief Steward. Gatbonton requested another month or until April 22, 1999 to improve his performance, to which Rauber agreed but allegedly refused to sign the Performance Evaluation Form. Neither did he sign the Memorandum on the extension.\n\nOn March 31, 1999, a notice [6] of termination of probationary employment effective April 9, 1999, on the above alleged grounds was served on Gatbonton. On April 12, 1999, he filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and non-payment of wages, with prayers for reinstatement, full backwages, and damages, including attorney's fees.\n\nOn July 10, 2000, the Labor Arbiter disposed of the case as follows:\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, respondent Dusit Hotel Nikko is hereby ordered to reinstate upon promulgation of this decision, the herein complainant Renato Gatbonton to his former position as regular Chief Steward without loss of seniority rights and other benefits with full backwages from the time of his illegal dismissal on April 9, 1999 up to actual reinstatement or in the amount of P375,000 (P25,000 x 15 months or up to July 9, 2000) to be adjusted, plus ten percent (10%) attorneys fees.\n\nThe same respondent is also ordered to pay complainant's unpaid salaries within ten (10) days from receipt hereof.\n\nComplainant's prayer for damages is hereby dismissed for lack of concrete evidence.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7]\nThe Labor Arbiter found that at the time of the respondent's termination, he was already a regular employee. Further, there was no evidence that Gatbonton was assessed or evaluated by the petitioner during his three-month probationary employment; thus, he could not be dismissed for failure to meet the reasonable standards for his position.\n\nAggrieved, the petitioner appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision and declared the respondent's dismissal legal. The NLRC noted that the Personnel Action Form showed respondent's probationary employment was extended from February 24 to April 22, 1999. Hence, when he was terminated on April 9, 1999, he was still on probation.\n\nThe respondent filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals contending that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter. The respondent maintained: (1) that the petitioner failed to establish with substantial evidence that the respondent's probationary employment was extended; (2) that the petitioner failed to establish that the alleged extension was formally communicated to the respondent during his probationary employment; and (3) that the petitioner failed to establish that the alleged extension was valid and legal. [8]\n\nThe appellate court granted the petition and reinstated the decision of the Labor Arbiter. The present petition is anchored on the following grounds:\nI\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WAS STILL A PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE AT THE TIME OF HIS DISMISSAL;\n\nII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WAS VALIDLY DISMISSED ON THE GROUND OF FAILURE TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE MADE KNOWN TO HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS ENGAGEMENT;\n\nIII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT [RESPONDENT] IS ENTITLED TO REINSTATEMENT, BACKWAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES;\n\nIV\n\nWHETHER OR NOT [RESPONDENT] HAS BEEN PAID HIS REMAINING SALARIES. [9]\nEssentially, we must resolve two questions: (1) Was respondent a regular employee at the time of his dismissal? and (2) Was he validly terminated?\n\nAs in previous cases, when we find arbitrariness and disharmony in the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission, we review the findings of fact and if errors are found, we will not hesitate to set aside such factual findings of these agencies.\n\nHere, Article 281 of the Labor Code is pertinent. It provides that:\nART. 281. Probationary Employment . -- Probationary employment shall not exceed six (6) months from the date the employee started working, unless it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer period. The services of an employee who has been engaged on a probationary basis may be terminated for a just cause or when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his engagement. An employee who is allowed to work after a probationary period shall be considered a regular employee.\nAs Article 281 clearly states, a probationary employee can be legally terminated either: (1) for a just cause; or (2) when the employee fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with the reasonable standards made known to him by the employer at the start of the employment. [10] Nonetheless, the power of the employer to terminate an employee on probation is not without limitations. First, this power must be exercised in accordance with the specific requirements of the contract. Second, the dissatisfaction on the part of the employer must be real and in good faith, not feigned so as to circumvent the contract or the law; and third, there must be no unlawful discrimination in the dismissal. In termination cases, the burden of proving just or valid cause for dismissing an employee rests on the employer. [11]\n\nHere, the petitioner did not present proof that the respondent was evaluated from November 21, 1998 to February 21, 1999, nor that his probationary employment was validly extended.\n\nThe petitioner alleged that at the end of the respondent's three-month probationary employment, Rauber recommended that the period be extended for two months since respondent Gatbonton was not yet ready for regular employment. [12] The petitioner presented a Personnel Action Form [13] containing the recommendation. We observed, however, that this document was prepared on March 31, 1999, the end of the 4th month of the respondent's employment. In fact, the recommended action was termination of probationary employment effective April 9, 1999, and not extension of probation period. [14] Upon appeal to the NLRC, the petitioner presented another Personnel Action Form [15] prepared on March 2, 1999, showing that the respondent's probationary employment was extended for two months effective February 23, 1999.\n\nThe Personnel Action Form dated March 2, 1999, contained the following remarks: \"subject to undergo extension of probation for two (2) months as per attached memo.\" Yet, we find this document inconclusive. First , the action form did not contain the results of the respondent's evaluation. Without the evaluation, the action form had no basis. Second , the action form spoke of an attached memo which the petitioner identified as Rauber's Memorandum, recommending the extension of the respondent's probation period for two months. Again, the supposed Memorandum was not presented. Third , the action form did not bear the respondent's signature.\n\nIn the absence of any evaluation or valid extension, we cannot conclude that respondent failed to meet the standards of performance set by the hotel for a chief steward. At the expiration of the three-month period, Gatbonton had become a regular employee. It is an elementary rule in the law on labor relations that a probationary employee engaged to work beyond the probationary period of six months, as provided under Article 281 of the Labor Code, or for any length of time set forth by the employer (in this case, three months), shall be considered a regular employee. [16] This is clear in the last sentence of Article 281. Any circumvention of this provision would put to naught the State's avowed protection for labor.\n\nSince respondent was not dismissed for a just or authorized cause, his dismissal was illegal, and he is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights, and other privileges as well as to full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.\n\nThe petitioner presented copies of Check No. 0000200953 [17] and the corresponding voucher [18] in the amount of P6,095.19, to prove that the respondent had been paid his remaining unpaid salaries on May 26, 1999. We have no reason to disbelieve said payment, since the respondent failed to refute this matter before the Court of Appeals and before us.\n\nWHEREFORE , the instant petition for review is DENIED . The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 73296, which reversed the Resolution dated September 24, 2001 of the National Labor Relations Commission, is AFFIRMED WITH the MODIFICATION that the order for payment of unpaid salaries is DELETED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, Carpio Morales, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 42-46.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BERNARD MAPALO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N CHICO-NAZARIO, J.: In its Decision[1] dated 27 October 2004, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 32 of Agoo, La Union, in Criminal Case No. A-2871, found appellant Bernard Mapalo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, and imposed upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua. On appeal, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision[2] dated 21 November 2005, modifying the Decision of the RTC, and finding Bernard Mapalo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Murder.The IndictmentsAppellant, together with Peter Doe, John Doe and Peter Doe, Jr., was charged before the RTC of Agoo, La Union with the crime of Murder, said to have been committed as follows:That on or about the 13th day of February, 1994, in the Municipality of Aringay, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and being then armed with lead pipes and bladed weapons and conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, did then and there by means of treachery and with evident premeditation and taking advantage of their superior strength, wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence on one Manuel Piamonte y Ugay by clubbing him with the said pipes and stabbing him several times with the said bladed weapons, and thereby inflicting on the aforenamed victim fatal injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.Contrary to law.[3]The RTC ordered the issuance of a warrant of arrest for the apprehension of the appellant. No bail was recommended.[4] When the case was called, appellant filed a Motion for Reinvestigation and Bail, which was granted.On 27 March 1995, 3rd Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Manuel S. Oliva filed a Motion to Admit Amended Information and for the Issuance of Warrant of Arrest for the Apprehension of the Other Accused,[5] alleging that a reinvestigation was conducted and a prima facie case was found against the other accused. It was prayed that an amended information be admitted and a warrant of arrest be issued for the apprehension of Alejandro Fajardo, Jr., Jimmy Frigillana, and Rolando Mapalo alias \"Lando.\" Finding the Motion to be well-taken, the RTC issued an Order,[6] dated 27 April 1995, admitting the Amended Information, viz:The undersigned Assistant Provincial Prosecutor accuses BERNARD MAPALO, ALEJANDRO FAJARDO, JR., JIMMY FRIGILLANA and ROLANDO MAPALO alias Lando of the crime of MURDER, committed as follows:That on or about the 13th day of February, 1994, in the Municipality of Aringay, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, with intent to kill and being then armed with lead pipe and bladed weapons and conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, did then and there by means of treachery and with evident premeditation and taking advantage of their superior strength, wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence on one Manuel Piamonte y Ugay by clubbing him with the said pipe and stabbing him several times with the said bladed weapons, and thereby inflicting on the aforenamed victim fatal injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.[7]Consequently, a warrant of arrest was issued for the apprehension of Alejandro Fajardo, Jr., Jimmy Frigillana, and Rolando Mapalo alias \"Lando.\" Only Alejandro Fajardo, Jr. was apprehended; the other two remain at large.On arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty.[8] Thereafter, trial on the merits commenced.After the prosecution had rested its case, Alejandro Fajardo, Jr. filed a Demurrer to Evidence which was granted by the RTC, in its Order[9] dated 5 November 1998, on the ground that the prosecution did not present any evidence against him. Thus, only accused Bernard Mapalo proceeded to present his evidence. He was eventually found guilty.The Case for the ProsecutionThe prosecution presented Calixto Garcia (Garcia) as its lone eyewitness.Garcia testified that on 12 February 1994, a pre-Valentine dance was held in Sitio Baracbac, Brgy. Sta. Cecilia in Aringay, La Union. He watched the dance, along with the appellant and Jimmy Frigillana.[10] In the early morning of 13 February 1994, at around 3:00 a.m., a fight erupted between Manuel Piamonte (Piamonte) and the group of Lando Mapalo,[11] Jimmy Frigillana, and the appellant.[12]Garcia further testified that he witnessed the fight from a distance of more or less five (5) meters. He claimed that he could see the incident very clearly because of the light at the dancing hall.[13] He saw the appellant club Piamonte with a lead pipe from behind, hitting him on the right side of the head.[14] The pipe was one and a half (1 and \u00bd) feet in length, and one and a half (1 and \u00bd) inches in diameter.[15] At that time when the appellant struck Piamonte with a lead pipe, he saw Jimmy Frigillana and Lando Mapalo standing in front of Piamonte. Later, he saw the dead body of Piamonte, which had suffered multiple stab wounds.[16] He saw stab wounds on the left and right parts of the abdomen, and below the left breast, as well as small wounds on the front part of his left hip.[17] Garcia disclosed that he neither witnessed how Piamonte was stabbed, nor did he see the act of stabbing Piamonte.[18] He does not know who stabbed the latter.[19] It was only when Piamonte's shirt was removed when he saw stab wounds on the former's dead body.[20]The Case for the DefenseAppellant testified that in the evening of 13 February 1994,[21] at around 9:00 p.m., he, along with his wife, Caridad Mapalo, entertained several guests at their residence, namely, Crispin Calderon, Noel Cordero, Ruel Mercado, and Rolando Mapalo.[22] They drank wine.[23] Appellant knew that there was a Valentine's Day dance celebration at the dance hall, located northeast of his house at a distance of about 20-30 meters.[24] At 12:30 a.m., after his guests had left the house, he went to sleep.[25] At 3:00 a.m., his wife woke him up and was informed that somebody had been stabbed. He said he came to know that Piamonte was the person who was stabbed.[26] He added that he planned to go out of the house, but his wife prevented him from doing so.[27] He, thereafter, returned to his room, and went back to sleep.[28]Corroborating the appellant's defense of denial and alibi, his wife, Caridad Mapalo, narrated that on 13 February 1994[29] at 8:00 p.m., she served brandy to her husband and their guests at their residence. The celebration finished at around 12:00 midnight.[30] Thereafter, she and her husband went to sleep, while their guests proceeded to the dance hall. At 3:00 a.m., she awoke because of a commotion from the dance hall.[31] She described that the dance hall is around 60 to 70 meters, southwest of their residence.[32] She went outside of their house, and along with her sister-in-law, Marissa Dapit, proceeded to the edge of the dancing hall.[33] She claimed that her husband did not go out and just stayed at their house.[34] She explained that she and Marissa Dapit went out to see or to know the name of the person who died at the commotion.[35] At the dancing hall, she saw the body of Piamonte, lying face down.[36]The Ruling of the RTCAfter trial, the RTC rendered a Decision, dated 27 October 2004, finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.It ruled that appellant's defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the lone eyewitness. As emphasized by the RTC, per admission of appellant, the distance between his house and the dancing hall is only 20 to 30 meters, more or less. There was no physical impossibility for the appellant to be present at the scene of the crime. Moreover, it found Garcia's testimony to be consistent and uncontradicted. On the other hand, the RTC considered the testimony of Caridad Mapalo as defying the natural course of human reaction and experience. The RTC found it strange that it was only Caridad Mapalo who was awakened by the commotion, while the appellant remained asleep. Learning of the same, Caridad Mapalo exposed herself to danger by proceeding to the dance hall to see what the commotion was all about without even informing her husband. The RTC conjectured that Caridad Mapalo proceeded to the dance hall not to see what the commotion was all about, but because she was informed that her husband was involved in a fight.[37]Further, the RTC ruled that conspiracy was established by the prosecution. According to the RTC, the appellant was clearly identified by Garcia as the one who struck Piamonte on the head with a lead pipe, which alone is \"sufficient manifestation of a concerted, common and united design with the other accused to commit an unlawful and felonious act.\" The fact that the medical certificate shows the cause of death as stab wounds was deemed by the RTC as immaterial, in view of the presence of conspiracy. The RTC also appreciated the attendance of abuse of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance, on the rationalization that the perpetrators were armed with bladed weapons and a lead pipe that were out of proportion to the unarmed Piamonte.The decretal portion of the RTC Decision states:WHEREFORE, the accused BERNARD MAPALO is hereby found Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.Further, the accused is ordered to pay the heirs of Manuel Piamonte the amount of Twelve Thousand Seven Hundred Pesos (P12,700.00) as actual damages. Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity for the death of Piamonte and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.[38]The Ruling of the Court of AppealsBefore the appellate court, appellant challenged the credibility of the prosecution's lone eyewitness. Appellant similarly assailed the ruling of the RTC on the ground that it erred in convicting him despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.[39]The Court of Appeals found no adequate reason to disturb the findings of the RTC in weighing the testimony of Garcia. It did not find significant the alleged inconsistencies in Garcia's affidavits as executed before the investigating police and the prosecutor.[40] The appellate court did not accept the appellant's defense of alibi. The positive identification of the prosecution witness which was consistent and categorical, and shown to be without ill-motive, has discredited appellant's defense.The Court of Appeals, however, found reason to modify the findings of the RTC. It convicted the appellant of frustrated murder only. It was not convinced that the evidence on record established conspiracy among the appellant and his co-accused. The appellate court rationalized that while the evidence shows that Piamonte sustained stab wounds which caused his death,[41] the appellant was never identified as the one who inflicted the stab wounds on the deceased. According to the appellate court, the prosecution's evidence only established that the appellant clubbed Piamonte with a lead pipe. However, the prosecution's witness did not see the stabbing. He was not able to describe the particular acts which caused Piamonte's death. Hence, it cannot be inferred from the account of the witness that the appellant and his co-accused came to an agreement to commit a felony, or that they decided to commit the same, by concerted acts.[42] The Court of Appeals made the following observations:In the first place, the killing was the result of a fight that erupted suddenly during the Valentine dance, which discourages the conclusion that the killing was planned. Also, the witness did not see any stabbing. He did not see anyone else perform any act of stabbing or hitting, other than the appellant delivering blows with a lead pipe on the victim. There is no proof, therefore, of any concerted action or common design to kill the victim that could be the basis for a finding of conspiracy among several malefactors. Because of this, it could not be said that conspiracy was proven attendant beyond reasonable doubt.[43]In the absence of a conspiracy, the Court of Appeals said that the appellant could only be held liable for the consequences of his own criminal act. It ruled that when the appellant hit Piamonte in the head with the lead pipe, he performed all the acts that would have brought about the death of the victim.[44] Piamonte's death however was due to some other supervening cause, independent of the appellant's will.[45]The fallo of the Court of Appeals' Decision reads, viz:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the lower court's Decision is hereby MODIFIED, in that the accused-appellant Bernard Mapalo is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Murder. Accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to 8 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal, as maximum.Further, the accused is ordered to pay the heirs of Manuel Piamonte[,] the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as temperate damages, Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as civil indemnity and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as moral damages pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence. (People v. Pacana, 345 SCRA 72 [2000]; People v. Givera, 349 SCRA 513 [2001]).[46]The IssuesAppellant contends that:ITHE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO IDENTIFY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IN OPEN COURT; andIIASSUMING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF FRUSTRATED MURDER INSTEAD OF FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE.[47]The Ruling of the CourtIn support of the first assignment of error, appellant raises, for the first time, the defense that the witness for the prosecution failed to positively identify him during the trial proceedings. Citing People v. Galera[48] and People v. Hatton,[49] appellant submits that the prosecution failed to discharge its first duty, which is the identification of the accused as the author of the crime charged.[50] Witness Garcia did not identify the appellant in open court.Appellant further posits that Garcia did not deny drinking gin at around 9:00 p.m. on 13 February 1994 until 3:00 a.m. of the following day. Garcia was then intoxicated if he had been drinking hard liquor continuously for six hours. At such point, he can no longer positively determine a person's identity. It is argued that the foregoing circumstances create doubts as to the identity of the appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.We first tackle the issue on the lack of in-court identification.True that on the matter of identification, the Court in Hatton said:More importantly, the accused-appellant was not positively identified in court. True, his name was referred to by both Basierto and Ongue in their respective direct testimonies. However, he was not identified in Court. The failure of the prosecution witness to positively identify the assailant in court is fatal to the prosecution's cause. Pre-trial identification is not sufficient.[51]Verily, the records are bereft of proof that there was in-court identification by the witness Garcia of the appellant. Indeed, Garcia did not point to the appellant in the courtroom. Such fact can be gleaned from the pertinent portion of the transcript of stenographic notes of the trial, reproduced hereunder, as follows:Direct-examination by Prosecutor Rudioof the witness Calixto GarciaQ Do you know the accused Bernard Mapalo?A I know, sir.Q If that accused is inside the courtroom now will you please stand up and point to him if he is inside the courtroom?A No, he is not around.COURT:Q Was he notified for (sic) today's hearing?INTERPRETER:Yes, he signed, sir.COURT: O R D E R:It appears that the accused Bernard Mapalo was being notified for (sic) today's hearing and his wife came to Court and informed the Honorable Court that her husband could not come to Court because he is sick.[52]The same testimony, however, conspicuously reveals that there was no identification in open court of the appellant because said appellant was not present at the time, despite notice, as according to his wife, he was sick.In a later case, this Court clarified that a physical courtroom identification is essential only when there is a question or doubt on whether the one alleged to have committed the crime is the same person who is charged in the information and subject of the trial. In People v. Quezada,[53] this Court expounded, thus:We do not see the absolute need for complainant to point to appellant in open court as her attacker. While positive identification by a witness is required by the law to convict an accused, it need not always be by means of a physical courtroom identification. As the court held in People v. Paglinawan:\"x x x. Although it is routine procedure for witnesses to point out the accused in open court by way of identification, the fact that the witness x x x did not do so in this case was because the public prosecutor failed to ask her to point out appellant, hence such omission does not in any way affect or diminish the truth or weight of her testimony.\"In-court identification of the offender is essential only when there is a question or doubt on whether the one alleged to have committed the crime is the same person who is charged in the information and subject of the trial. This is especially true in cases wherein the identity of the accused, who is a stranger to the prosecution witnesses, is dubitable. In the present case, however, there is no doubt at all that the rapist is the same individual mentioned in the Informations and described by the victim during the trial. (Emphasis supplied.)[54]We do not find herein a case where there is a question or doubt as to whether the one alleged to have committed the crime is the same person charged in the information and subject of the trial. In fact, appellant never denied that he is the person indicted in the Information, and subject of the proceedings. His denial is that he did not participate in the commission of the crime. Hence, in-court identification is not indispensable in the case at bar.We are convinced that the identity of the appellant was sufficiently established by the evidence on record.The appellant is not a stranger to the witness Garcia. The identity of the appellant to Garcia does not appear to be controvertible. In fact, appellant himself admits that he and Garcia are friends. Thus:Cross-examination by Prosecutor Lachicaof [appellant] Bernard MapaloQ Mr. Witness you said that you were informed by your counsel a while ago that a certain Calixto Garcia testified against you in this case did I get you right?A Yes, sir.Q And this Calixto Garica is a resident of the same Barangay as you are?A Yes, sir.Q In fact this Calixto Garcia is an acquaintance of yours?A Yes, sir.Q He is considered a friend?A Yes, sir I consider him as such.Q Prior to the incident which happened sometime on February 13, 1994, you have never quarreled with this Calixto Garcia?A No, sir.Q Even after that incident that happened on February 13, 1994 you never quarreled with Calixto Garcia?A No, sir.Q You know that this Calixto Garcia is not a relative of Piamonte the victim in this case?A I do not know whether he is a relative of the victim or not.Q You know for a fact that Calixto Garcia executed a statement before the police pointing to you or pointing to you as the assailant of Paimonte did you come to know that?A No, sir.Q You said that you know Calixto Garcia your friend according to you, did you confront him when he testified against you in court?A No, sir.Q You did not tell your friend that he was mistaken in identifying you as the assailant of Piamonte, correct?A No, sir. [55]The proper identification of the appellant is further bolstered by the fact that appellant's wife, Caridad Mapalo corroborated the testimony that the witness Garcia is a family friend of the spouses. Thus:Cross examination of Caridad Mapaloby Prosecutor LachicaQ Do you know a certain Calixto Garcia?A Yes, sir.Q He is your Barangay mate?A Yes, sir.Q His house is closed to your house, correct?A Far, sir.Q But he is staying within your barangay which is Sta. Cecilia?A Yes, sir.Q This Calixto Garcia whom you know is a friend of your family, correct?A Yes, sir.Q In fact, your family have (sic) never quarreled with Calixto Garcia?A None, sir.Q Prior to the filing of this case, you know that Calixto Garcia being a friend will not falsify his testimony regarding your husband?A Yes, sir.ATTY. RIMANDO: Objection, your honor.COURT: Objection overruled.PROSECUTOR LACHICA:Q Until now, this Calixto Garcia is your friend?A Yes, sir.PROSECUTOR LACHICA: That would be all for the witness.RE-DIRECT EXAMINATION BY ATTY. RIMANDO:Q This Calixto Garcia was your guest in that evening in your residence?A No, sir.Q Is your family close with (sic) this Calixto Garcia?A Yes, sir.[56]Moreover, we do not find herein the presence of factors[57] that could cause the witness Garcia to misidentify the appellant. In People v. Limpangog,[58] this Court enumerated several other known causes of misidentification, viz:x x x Known causes of misidentification have been identified as follows:\"Identification testimony has at least three components. First, witnessing a crime, whether as a victim or a bystander, involves perception of an event actually occurring. Second, the witness must memorize details of the event. Third, the witness must be able to recall and communicate accurately. Dangers of unreliability in eyewitness testimony arise at each of these three stages, for whenever people attempt to acquire, retain, and retrieve information accurately, they are limited by normal human fallibilities and suggestive influences.\"[59]There is no question that the witness Garcia was at a close range of merely five meters more or less from the scene of the incident.[60] Neither can it be said that the illumination was poor. The dancing hall was lighted.[60] No improper motive was attributed to the witness Garcia for testifying against the appellant. Moreover, witness Garcia is familiar not only to appellant. Garcia was also familiar with the deceased, Piamonte. Witness Garcia, in his testimony, referred to Piamonte as his third cousin.[62]On appellant's submission that it is doubtful if witness Garcia can still have positively identified him as one of the perpetrators of the crime considering that the former admitted to drinking hard liquor from 9:00 p.m. on 13 February 1994 until 3:00 a.m. of the following day, we are not convinced that the same can overthrow the trial court's evaluation of Garcia's testimony. Beyond appellant's bare allegations, no evidence whatsoever was produced to show that Garcia suffered from such a level of intoxication as to impair his facility and disable him to identify appellant. In the case of People v. Dee,[63] the credibility of the surviving victim therein as witness was disputed because he was under the influence of liquor at the time of the incident. In Dee, the witness was even found positive for alcoholic breath, but the Court ruled that such fact does not necessarily prevent him from making a positive identification of his attackers, especially since his level of intoxication was not shown to impair his faculties. The credibility of the witness therein was not made to suffer on that score alone.[64]The foregoing material considerations, taken together with the fact that witness Garcia and the appellant are not strangers to each other, satisfy us that the danger of Garcia misidentifying the appellant does not exist. Where the prosecution eyewitness was familiar with both victim and accused, and where the locus criminis afforded good visibility, and where no improper motive can be attributed to the witness for testifying against the accused, his version of the story deserves much weight.[65]Hence, we do not find any reason to depart from the general rule that the conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses deserve great respect, viz:The assessment of the credibility of witness and their testimony is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand; and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under examination. Its findings on such matters are binding and conclusive on appellate courts unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.[66]Appellant's defense of alibi and denial cannot stand in the face of the positive identification of the accused. We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.[67] It is facile to fabricate and difficult to disprove, and is generally rejected.[68]For the defense of alibi to prosper, it must be shown with clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the commission of the crime charged, the accused is in a place other than the situs of the crime such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the situs criminis when the crime was committed.[69]In the case at bar, appellant was not successful in invoking the defense of alibi. Appellant insists that he was sleeping at his residence at the time when the incident occurred. The RTC and the Court of Appeals consistently found that the distance between appellant's residence and the dance hall, or the situs criminis, is 20 to 30 meters, more or less.[70] Such a distance is negligible. In fact, appellant's wife testified that from their residence, she could see the people dancing at the hall.[71] It was not highly impossible for the appellant to be physically present at the dancing hall at the time of the occurrence of the incident. We, therefore, reject appellant's defense of alibi.We shall now determine the criminal liability of the appellant.To reiterate, the RTC, in convicting the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, proceeded from a rationalization that there was conspiracy among appellant and his co-accused. It also appreciated the attendance of abuse of superior strength to qualify the crime to Murder.The Court of Appeals was unable to agree with the RTC. It found that the conspiracy was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. It ruled that the witness Garcia admitted to not being able to see the stabbing. He could only attest to the clubbing of the victim by appellant with a lead pipe. No proof was shown as to the concerted action of the malefactors of their common design to kill. It, thus, modified the RTC's conviction, and, instead, found appellant guilty of frustrated murder.The Amended Information charged the appellant and his co-accused with conspiracy in killing Piamonte.Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.[72] Conspiracy as a basis for conviction must rest on nothing less than a moral certainty.[73] Considering the far-reaching consequences of criminal conspiracy, the same degree of proof necessary in establishing the crime is required to support the attendance thereof, i.e., it must be shown to exist as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the offense itself.[74] Thus, it has been held that neither joint nor simultaneous actions is per se sufficient proof of conspiracy.[75]We are, further, guided by the following pronouncement of the Court:For conspiracy to exist, the participants must agree to the commission of the felony and decide to commit it, which agreement may be deduced from the mode and manner of the commission of the offense or inferred from the acts that point to joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of intent. x x x.[76]While conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, it is, nonetheless, required that it be proved by clear and convincing evidence by showing a series of acts done by each of the accused in concert and in pursuance of the common unlawful purpose.[77]There is a want of evidence to show the concerted acts of the appellant and his co-accused in pursuing a common design - to kill the deceased, Piamonte. The sole eyewitness for the prosecution, Garcia, was categorical and precise in declaring that he did not see the act of stabbing Piamonte, nor the manner in which Piamonte was stabbed. He later learned that Piamonte died from stab wounds when he saw the latter's dead body covered with stab wounds. The cause of death of Piamonte, as found by the RTC and the Court of Appeals,[78] and as borne by the records, is multiple stab wounds.[79] It was, thus, incumbent on the part of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant and his co-accused acted in concert with a unity of purpose to kill Piamonte. They must show to the satisfaction of this Court the appellant's overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity.[80] They must show that appellant's act of striking Piamonte with a pipe was an intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.[81]The prosecution was unable to show, either by direct or indirect evidence, proof of the agreement among the appellant and his co-accused to warrant conspiracy as a basis for appellant's conviction. No evidence was even adduced to show implied conspiracy. Nothing has been shown that the appellant and his co-accused were \"aimed by their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their combined acts, though apparently independent of each other were, in fact, connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment.\" [82]This complete absence of evidence on the part of the prosecution to show the conduct of the appellant and his co-accused, disclosing a common understanding among them relative to the commission of the offense, [83] is fatal to the prosecution. The prosecution's witness could not testify on the manner by which the deceased Piamonte was stabbed, precisely because by his own admission, he did not see the stabbing. No account of the stabbing which caused the death of the deceased Piamonte was ever given nor shown. Unfortunately, no account of how Piamonte died was ever given, except for the established fact that he died due to stabbing. The appellant's act of holding a lead pipe and hitting the deceased in the head was not shown to be in furtherance of the common design of killing the deceased. What transpired during the stabbing of the victim, which is material to proving the fact of conspiracy, is, regrettably, left merely to speculation. This Court must neither conjecture nor surmise that a conspiracy existed. The rule is clear that the guilt of the accused must be proved with moral certainty. [84] All doubts should be resolved in favor of the accused. Thus, the time honored principle in criminal law that if the inculpatory facts are capable of two or more explanations, one consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other with his guilt, the Court should adopt that which is more favorable to the accused for then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty. [85]Liability of the Accused Bernard MapaloThere being no conspiracy, the liability of the appellant will revolve around his individual participation in the event. [86]In the case of Li v. People, [87] a street fight ensued resulting in the death of the victim therein. No conspiracy was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The liability of the accused Li who was shown to have struck the victim's right arm with a baseball bat, resulting in a contusion was, thus, determined by the Court in the following manner:The only injury attributable to Li is the contusion on the victim's right arm that resulted from Li striking [the victim] Arugay with a baseball bat. In view of the victim's supervening death from injuries which cannot be attributed to Li beyond reasonable doubt, the effects of the contusion caused by Li are not mortal or at least lie entirely in the realm of speculation. When there is no evidence of actual incapacity of the offended party for labor or of the required medical attendance, the offense is only slight physical injuries, penalized as follows:x x x xThe duration of the penalty of arresto menor is from one day to thirty days. The felony of slight physical injuries is necessarily included in the homicide charges. Since the Information against Li states that among the means employed to commit the felonious act was the use of the baseball bat, conviction on the lesser offense or slight physical injuries is proper. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances established, the imposition of the penalty in its medium period is warranted. Li was convicted by the RTC on January 5, 1994. Having long served more than the imposable penalty, Li is entitled to immediate release unless, of course, he is being lawfully detained for another cause. [88]In the case at bar, no injury was shown to be attributable to the appellant. The only medical evidence that appears on records is the deceased Piamonte's death certificate, [89] which indicates that the cause of death is massive hypovolemia [90] secondary to multiple stab wounds. The factual findings of the RTC and the Court of Appeals coincide to show that the cause of death of Piamonte is multiple stab wounds. Nothing has been shown otherwise. Other than the presence of multiple stab wounds, no other type of injury on the deceased was established. No contusions or injury on the head of the victim or anywhere else in his body caused by a lead pipe was shown. The witness Garcia, in his testimony, merely pointed to stab wounds on the different parts of the body of the deceased. [91] No proof on the injury that was sustained by the deceased that can be attributable to appellant's act was demonstrated. No other physical evidence was proffered. [92]We cannot convict appellant of Attempted or Frustrated Murder or Homicide. The principal and essential element of attempted or frustrated homicide or murder is the assailant's intent to take the life of the person attacked. [93] Such intent must be proved clearly and convincingly, so as to exclude reasonable doubt thereof. [94] Intent to kill may be proved by evidence of: (a) motive; (b) the nature or number of weapons used in the commission of the crime; (c) the nature and number of wounds inflicted on the victim; (d) the manner the crime was committed; and (e) words uttered by the offender at the time the injuries are inflicted by him on the victim. [95]In the case at bar, no motive on the part of appellant to kill Piamonte was shown either prior or subsequent to the incident. Nor can such intent to kill be inferred from his acts. It bears reiterating that no injury on the body of the deceased was attributed to the appellant's act of hitting the victim with a lead pipe. On the nature of the weapon used, the lead pipe was described by Garcia as one and a half feet in length, and one and a half inches in diameter. The relevant testimony of Garcia on the incident follows:Q Now you said that Bernard Mapalo clubbed this Manuel Piamonte. He clubbed him from behind?A Yes, sir.Q And what did he use in clubbing the victim, is it lead pipe?A Yes, sir.Q How long is that lead pipe?A Around this length. (Witness demonstrated 1 1/2 feet).Q And how wide is the diameter?A 1 \u00bd inches.Q What part of his body was hit?A Right side of the head, sir. (Witness showing the right side of his head.) [96]Homicidal intent must be evidenced by the acts that, at the time of their execution, are unmistakably calculated to produce the death of the victim by adequate means. [97] We cannot infer intent to kill from the appellant's act of hitting Piamonte in the head with a lead pipe. In the first place, wounds were not shown to have been inflicted because of the act. Secondly, absent proof of circumstances to show the intent to kill beyond reasonable doubt, this Court cannot declare that the same was attendant.When the offender shall ill-treat another by deed without causing any injury, and without causing dishonor, the offense is Maltreatment under Article 266, [98] par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code. It was beyond reasonable doubt that by hitting Piamonte, appellant ill-treated the latter, without causing any injury. As we have earlier stated, no proof of injury was offered. Maltreatment is necessarily included in Murder, which is the offense charged in the Information. Thus:ART. 266. Slight physical injuries and maltreatment. - The crime of slight physical injuries shall be punished:x x x x3. By arresto menor in its minimum period or a fine not exceeding 50 pesos when the offender shall ill-treat another by deed without causing any injury.The duration of the penalty of arresto menor in its minimum period is 1 day to 10 days.WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated 21 November 2005, in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00408 is MODIFIED. Appellant Bernard Mapalo is ACQUITTED of the charge of MURDER for lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt. He is found GUILTY of the crime of MALTREATMENT, as defined and punished by Article 266, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code. He is accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of arresto menor of 10 days. Considering that appellant has been incarcerated since 2004, which is well-beyond the period of the penalty herein imposed, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons is ordered to cause appellant's IMMEDIATE RELEASE, unless appellant is being lawfully held for another cause, and to inform this Court, within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision, of the compliance therewith.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Presiding Judge Samuel R.

The list is as follows:the witness originally stated that he could not identify anyone;the identifying witness knew the accused before the crime, but made no accusation against him when questioned by the police;a serious discrepancy exists between the identifying witness' original description and the actual description of the accused;before identifying the accused at the trial, the witness erroneously identified some other person;other witnesses to the crime fail to identify the accused;before trial, the witness sees the accused but fails to identify him;before the commission of the crime, the witness had limited opportunity to see the accused;the witness and the person identified are of different racial groups;during his original observation of the perpetrator of the crime, the witness was unaware that a crime was involved;a considerable time elapsed between the witness' view of the criminal and his identification of the accused;several persons committed the crime; andthe witness fails to make a positive trial identification.[58] 444 Phil 691 (2003).[59] Id. at 707.[60] TSN, 15 July 1996, p. 10.[60] Id.[62] TSN, 15 July 1996, p. 17.[63] 396 Phil. 274 (2000).[64] Id. at 283.[65] Baldeo v.

No. 172608, February 06, 2007 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BERNARD MAPALO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BERNARD MAPALO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nIn its Decision [1] dated 27 October 2004, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 32 of Agoo, La Union, in Criminal Case No. A-2871, found appellant Bernard Mapalo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, and imposed upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua. On appeal, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision [2] dated 21 November 2005, modifying the Decision of the RTC, and finding Bernard Mapalo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Murder.\n\nThe Indictments\n\nAppellant, together with Peter Doe, John Doe and Peter Doe, Jr., was charged before the RTC of Agoo, La Union with the crime of Murder, said to have been committed as follows:\nThat on or about the 13 th day of February, 1994, in the Municipality of Aringay, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and being then armed with lead pipes and bladed weapons and conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, did then and there by means of treachery and with evident premeditation and taking advantage of their superior strength, wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence on one Manuel Piamonte y Ugay by clubbing him with the said pipes and stabbing him several times with the said bladed weapons, and thereby inflicting on the aforenamed victim fatal injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.\n\nContrary to law. [3] The RTC ordered the issuance of a warrant of arrest for the apprehension of the appellant.\u00a0 No bail was recommended. [4] When the case was called, appellant filed a Motion for Reinvestigation and Bail, which was granted.\n\nOn 27 March 1995, 3 rd Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Manuel S. Oliva filed \u00a0a Motion to Admit Amended Information and for the Issuance of Warrant of Arrest for the Apprehension of the Other Accused, [5] alleging that a reinvestigation was conducted and a prima facie case was found against the other accused.\u00a0 It was prayed that an amended information be admitted and a warrant of arrest be issued for the apprehension of \u00a0Alejandro Fajardo, Jr., Jimmy Frigillana, and Rolando Mapalo alias \"Lando.\"\u00a0 Finding the Motion to be well-taken, the RTC issued an Order, [6] dated 27 April 1995, admitting the Amended Information, viz:\nThe undersigned Assistant Provincial Prosecutor accuses BERNARD MAPALO, ALEJANDRO FAJARDO, JR., JIMMY FRIGILLANA and ROLANDO MAPALO alias Lando of the crime of MURDER, committed as follows:\n\nThat on or about the 13 th day of February, 1994, in the Municipality of Aringay, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, with intent to kill and being then armed with lead pipe and bladed weapons and conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, did then and there by means of treachery and with evident premeditation and taking advantage of their superior strength, wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence on one Manuel Piamonte y Ugay by clubbing him with the said pipe and stabbing him several times with the said bladed weapons, and thereby inflicting on the aforenamed victim fatal injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs. [7] Consequently, a warrant of arrest was issued for the apprehension of Alejandro Fajardo, Jr., Jimmy Frigillana, and Rolando Mapalo alias \"Lando.\"\u00a0 Only Alejandro Fajardo, Jr. was apprehended; the other two remain at large.\n\nOn arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty. [8] Thereafter, trial on the merits commenced.\n\nAfter the prosecution had rested its case, Alejandro Fajardo, Jr. filed a Demurrer to Evidence which was granted by the RTC, in its Order [9] dated 5 November 1998, on the ground that the prosecution did not present any evidence against him.\u00a0 Thus, only accused Bernard Mapalo proceeded to present his evidence.\u00a0 He was eventually found guilty.\n\nThe Case for the Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution presented Calixto Garcia (Garcia) as its lone eyewitness.\n\nGarcia testified that on 12 February 1994, a pre-Valentine dance was held in Sitio Baracbac, Brgy. Sta. Cecilia in Aringay, La Union.\u00a0 He watched the dance, along with the appellant and Jimmy Frigillana. [10] In the early morning of 13 February 1994, at around 3:00 a.m., a fight erupted between Manuel Piamonte (Piamonte) and the group of Lando Mapalo, [11] Jimmy Frigillana, and the appellant. [12]\n\nGarcia further testified that he witnessed the fight from a distance of more or less five (5) meters.\u00a0 He claimed that he could see the incident very clearly because of the light at the dancing hall. [13] He saw the appellant club Piamonte with a lead pipe from behind, hitting him on the right side of the head. [14] The pipe was one and a half (1 and \u00bd) feet in length, and one and a half (1 and \u00bd) inches in diameter. [15] At that time when the appellant struck Piamonte with a lead pipe, he saw Jimmy Frigillana and Lando Mapalo standing in front of Piamonte.\u00a0 Later, he saw the dead body of Piamonte, which had suffered multiple stab wounds. [16] He saw stab wounds on the left and right parts of the abdomen, and below the left breast, as well as small wounds on the front part of his left hip. [17] Garcia disclosed that he neither witnessed how Piamonte was stabbed, nor did he see the act of stabbing Piamonte. [18] He does not know who stabbed the latter. [19] It was only when Piamonte's shirt was removed when he saw stab wounds on the former's dead body. [20]\n\nThe Case for the Defense\n\nAppellant testified that in the evening of 13 February 1994, [21] at around 9:00 p.m., he, along with his wife, Caridad Mapalo, entertained several guests at their residence, namely, Crispin Calderon, Noel Cordero, Ruel Mercado, and Rolando Mapalo. [22] They drank wine. [23] Appellant knew that there was a Valentine's Day dance celebration at the dance hall, located northeast of his house at a distance of about 20-30 meters. [24] At 12:30 a.m., after his guests had left the house, he went to sleep. [25] At 3:00 a.m., his wife woke him up and was informed that somebody had been stabbed.\u00a0 He said he came to know that Piamonte was the person who was stabbed. [26] He added that he planned to go out of the house, but his wife prevented him from doing so. [27] He, thereafter, returned to his room, and went back to sleep. [28]\n\nCorroborating the appellant's defense of denial and alibi, his wife, Caridad Mapalo, narrated that on 13 February 1994 [29] at 8:00 p.m., she served brandy to her husband and their guests at their residence.\u00a0 The celebration finished at around 12:00 midnight. [30] Thereafter, she and her husband went to sleep, while their guests proceeded to the dance hall.\u00a0 At 3:00 a.m., she awoke because of a commotion from the dance hall. [31] She described that the dance hall is around 60 to 70 meters, southwest of their residence. [32] She went outside of their house, and along with her sister-in-law, Marissa Dapit, proceeded to the edge of the dancing hall. [33] She claimed that her husband did not go out and just stayed at their house. [34] She explained that she and Marissa Dapit went out to see or to know the name of the person who died at the commotion. [35] At the dancing hall, she saw the body of Piamonte, lying face down. [36]\n\nThe Ruling of the RTC\n\nAfter trial, the RTC rendered a Decision, dated 27 October 2004, finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.\n\nIt ruled that appellant's defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the lone eyewitness.\u00a0 As emphasized by the RTC, per admission of appellant, the distance between his house and the dancing hall is only 20 to 30 meters, more or less.\u00a0 There was no physical impossibility for the appellant to be present at the scene of the crime.\u00a0 Moreover, it found Garcia's testimony to be consistent and uncontradicted.\u00a0 On the other hand, the RTC considered the testimony of Caridad Mapalo as defying the natural course of human reaction and experience.\u00a0 The RTC found it strange that it was only Caridad Mapalo who was awakened by the commotion, while the appellant remained asleep.\u00a0 Learning of the same, Caridad Mapalo exposed herself to danger by proceeding to the dance hall to see what the commotion was all about without even informing her husband.\u00a0 The RTC conjectured that Caridad Mapalo proceeded to the dance hall not to see what the commotion was all about, but because she was informed that her husband was involved in a fight. [37]\n\nFurther, the RTC ruled that conspiracy was established by the prosecution.\u00a0 According to the RTC, the appellant was clearly identified by Garcia as the one who struck Piamonte on the head with a lead pipe, which alone is \"sufficient manifestation of a concerted, common and united design with the other accused to commit an unlawful and felonious act.\"\u00a0 The fact that the medical certificate shows the cause of death as stab wounds was deemed by the RTC as immaterial, in view of the presence of conspiracy.\u00a0 The RTC also appreciated the attendance of abuse of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance, on the rationalization that the perpetrators were armed with bladed weapons and a lead pipe that were out of proportion to the unarmed Piamonte.\n\nThe decretal portion of the RTC Decision states:\nWHEREFORE, the accused BERNARD MAPALO is hereby found Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.\n\nFurther, the accused is ordered to pay the heirs of Manuel Piamonte the amount of Twelve Thousand Seven Hundred Pesos (P12,700.00) as actual damages.\u00a0 Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity for the death of Piamonte and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages. [38]\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nBefore the appellate court, appellant challenged the credibility of the prosecution's lone eyewitness.\u00a0 Appellant similarly assailed the ruling of the RTC on the ground that it erred in convicting him despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. [39]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found no adequate reason to disturb the findings of the RTC in weighing the testimony of Garcia.\u00a0 It did not find significant the alleged inconsistencies in Garcia's affidavits as executed before the investigating police and the prosecutor. [40] The appellate court did not accept the appellant's defense of alibi. \u00a0The positive identification of the prosecution witness which was consistent and categorical, and shown to be without ill-motive, has discredited appellant's defense.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, however, found reason to modify the findings of the RTC.\u00a0 It convicted the appellant of frustrated murder only.\u00a0 It was not convinced that the evidence on record established conspiracy among the appellant and his co-accused.\u00a0 The appellate court rationalized that while the evidence shows that Piamonte sustained stab wounds which caused his death, [41] the appellant was never identified as the one who inflicted the stab wounds on the deceased.\u00a0 According to the appellate court, the prosecution's evidence only established that the appellant clubbed Piamonte with a lead pipe.\u00a0 However, the prosecution's witness did not see the stabbing.\u00a0 He was not able to describe the particular acts which caused Piamonte's death. Hence, it cannot be inferred from the account of the witness that the appellant and his co-accused came to an agreement to commit a felony, or that they decided to commit the same, by concerted acts. [42] The Court of Appeals made the following observations:\nIn the first place, the killing was the result of a fight that erupted suddenly during the Valentine dance, which discourages the conclusion that the killing was planned.\u00a0 Also, the witness did not see any stabbing.\u00a0 He did not see anyone else perform any act of stabbing or hitting, other than the appellant delivering blows with a lead pipe on the victim.\u00a0 There is no proof, therefore, of any concerted action or common design to kill the victim that could be the basis for a finding of conspiracy among several malefactors.\u00a0 Because of this, it could not be said that conspiracy was proven attendant beyond reasonable doubt. [43] In the absence of a conspiracy, the Court of Appeals said that the appellant could only be held liable for the consequences of his own criminal act.\u00a0 It ruled that when the appellant hit Piamonte in the head with the lead pipe, he performed all the acts that would have brought about the death of the victim. [44] Piamonte's death however was due to some other supervening cause, independent of the appellant's will. [45]\n\nThe fallo of the Court of Appeals' Decision reads, viz:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the lower court's Decision is hereby MODIFIED, in that the accused-appellant Bernard Mapalo is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Murder.\u00a0 Accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to 8 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal , as maximum.\n\nFurther, the accused is ordered to pay the heirs of Manuel Piamonte[,] the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as temperate damages, Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as civil indemnity and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as moral damages pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.\u00a0 (People v. Pacana, 345 SCRA 72 [2000]; People v. Givera, 349 SCRA 513 [2001]). [46]\nThe Issues\n\nAppellant contends that:\nI\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO IDENTIFY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IN OPEN COURT; and\n\nII\n\nASSUMING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF FRUSTRATED MURDER INSTEAD OF FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE. [47]\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nIn support of the first assignment of error, appellant raises, for the first time , the defense that the witness for the prosecution failed to positively identify him during the trial proceedings. Citing People v. Galera [48] and People v. Hatton, [ 49] appellant submits that the prosecution failed to discharge its first duty, which is the identification of the accused as the author of the crime charged. [50] Witness Garcia did not identify the appellant in open court.\n\nAppellant further posits that Garcia did not deny drinking gin at around 9:00 p.m. on 13 February 1994 until 3:00 a.m. of the following day.\u00a0 Garcia was then intoxicated if he had been drinking hard liquor continuously for six hours.\u00a0 At such point, he can no longer positively determine a person's identity.\u00a0 It is argued that the foregoing circumstances create doubts as to the identity of the appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.\n\nWe first tackle the issue on the lack of in-court identification.\n\nTrue that on the matter of identification, the Court in Hatton said:\nMore importantly, the accused-appellant was not positively identified in court.\u00a0 True, his name was referred to by both Basierto and Ongue in their respective direct testimonies.\u00a0 However, he was not identified in Court.\u00a0 The failure of the prosecution witness to positively identify the assailant in court is fatal to the prosecution's cause.\u00a0 Pre-trial identification is not sufficient. [51] Verily, the records are bereft of proof that there was in-court identification by the witness Garcia of the appellant.\u00a0 Indeed, Garcia did not point to the appellant in the courtroom.\u00a0 Such fact can be gleaned from the pertinent portion of the transcript of stenographic notes of the trial, reproduced hereunder, as follows:\nDirect-examination by Prosecutor Rudio\nof the witness Calixto Garcia\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know the accused Bernard Mapalo?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I know, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If that accused is inside the courtroom now will you please stand up and point to him if he is inside the courtroom?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, he is not around.\n\nCOURT:\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Was he notified for (sic) today's hearing?\n\nINTERPRETER:\n\nYes, he signed, sir.\n\nCOURT:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 O R D E R:\n\nIt appears that the accused Bernard Mapalo was being notified for (sic) today's hearing and his wife came to Court and informed the Honorable Court that her husband could not come to Court because he is sick. [52] The same testimony, however, conspicuously reveals that there was no identification in open court of the appellant because said appellant was not present at the time, despite notice, as according to his wife, he was sick.\n\nIn a later case, this Court clarified that a physical courtroom identification is essential only when there is a question or doubt on whether the one alleged to have committed the crime is the same person who is charged in the information and subject of the trial.\u00a0 In People v. Quezada, [53] this Court expounded, thus:\nWe do not see the absolute need for complainant to point to appellant in open court as her attacker.\u00a0 While positive identification by a witness is required by the law to convict an accused, it need not always be by means of a physical courtroom identification. \u00a0As the court held in People v. Paglinawan:\n\n\"x x x. Although it is routine procedure for witnesses to point out the accused in open court by way of identification, the fact that the witness x x x did not do so in this case was because the public prosecutor failed to ask her to point out appellant, hence such omission does not in any way affect or diminish the truth or weight of her testimony.\"\n\nIn-court identification of the offender is essential only when there is a question or doubt on whether the one alleged to have committed the crime is the same person who is charged in the information and subject of the trial.\u00a0 This is especially true in cases wherein the identity of the accused, who is a stranger to the prosecution witnesses, is dubitable. In the present case, however, there is no doubt at all that the rapist is the same individual mentioned in the Informations and described by the victim during the trial. (Emphasis supplied.) [54] We do not find herein a case where there is a question or doubt as to whether the one alleged to have committed the crime is the same person charged in the information and subject of the trial.\u00a0 In fact, appellant never denied that he is the person indicted in the Information, and subject of the proceedings.\u00a0 His denial is that he did not participate in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 Hence, in-court identification is not indispensable in the case at bar.\n\nWe are convinced that the identity of the appellant was sufficiently established by the evidence on record.\n\nThe appellant is not a stranger to the witness Garcia.\u00a0 The identity of the appellant to Garcia does not appear to be controvertible.\u00a0 In fact, appellant himself admits that he and Garcia are friends.\u00a0 Thus:\nCross-examination by Prosecutor Lachica\nof [appellant] Bernard Mapalo\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Witness you said that you were informed by your counsel a while ago that a certain Calixto Garcia testified against you in this case did I get you right?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And this Calixto Garica is a resident of the same Barangay as you are?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact this Calixto Garcia is an acquaintance of yours?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He is considered a friend?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir I consider him as such.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the incident which happened sometime on February 13, 1994, you have never quarreled with this Calixto Garcia?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even after that incident that happened on February 13, 1994 you never quarreled with Calixto Garcia?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know that this Calixto Garcia is not a relative of Piamonte the victim in this case?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I do not know whether he is a relative of the victim or not.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know for a fact that Calixto Garcia executed a statement before the police pointing to you or pointing to you as the assailant of Paimonte did you come to know that?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said that you know Calixto Garcia your friend according to you, did you confront him when he testified against you in court?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You did not tell your friend that he was mistaken in identifying you as the assailant of Piamonte, correct?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir. [55] The proper identification of the appellant is further bolstered by the fact that appellant's wife, Caridad Mapalo corroborated the testimony that the witness Garcia is a family friend of the spouses.\u00a0 Thus:\nCross examination of Caridad Mapalo\nby Prosecutor Lachica\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know a certain Calixto Garcia?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He is your Barangay mate?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His house is closed to your house, correct?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Far, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But he is staying within your barangay which is Sta. Cecilia?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Calixto Garcia whom you know is a friend of your family, correct?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, your family have (sic) never quarreled with Calixto Garcia?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the filing of this case, you know that Calixto Garcia being a friend will not falsify his testimony regarding your husband?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nATTY. RIMANDO:\nObjection, your honor.\n\nCOURT:\nObjection overruled.\n\nPROSECUTOR LACHICA:\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until now, this Calixto Garcia is your friend?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nPROSECUTOR LACHICA:\nThat would be all for the witness.\n\nRE-DIRECT EXAMINATION BY ATTY. RIMANDO:\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Calixto Garcia was your guest in that evening in your residence?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is your family close with (sic) this Calixto Garcia?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir. [56] Moreover, we do not find herein the presence of factors [57] that could cause the witness Garcia to misidentify the appellant.\u00a0 In People v. Limpangog, [58] this Court enumerated several other known causes of misidentification, viz:\nx x x Known causes of misidentification have been identified as follows:\n\n\"Identification testimony has at least three components.\u00a0 First, witnessing a crime, whether as a victim or a bystander, involves perception of an event actually occurring.\u00a0 Second, the witness must memorize details of the event.\u00a0 Third, the witness must be able to recall and communicate accurately. Dangers of unreliability in eyewitness testimony arise at each of these three stages, for whenever people attempt to acquire, retain, and retrieve information accurately, they are limited by normal human fallibilities and suggestive influence s.\" [59] There is no question that the witness Garcia was at a close range of merely five meters more or less from the scene of the incident. [60] Neither can it be said that the illumination was poor.\u00a0 The dancing hall was lighted. [60] No improper motive was attributed to the witness Garcia for testifying against the appellant.\u00a0 Moreover, witness Garcia is familiar not only to appellant. Garcia was also familiar with the deceased, Piamonte.\u00a0\u00a0 Witness Garcia, in his testimony, referred to Piamonte as his third cousin. [62]\n\nOn appellant's submission that it is doubtful if witness Garcia can still have positively identified him as one of the perpetrators of the crime considering that the former admitted to drinking hard liquor from 9:00 p.m. on 13 February 1994 until 3:00 a.m. of the following day, we are not convinced that the same can overthrow the trial court's evaluation of Garcia's testimony.\u00a0 Beyond appellant's bare allegations, no evidence whatsoever was produced to show that Garcia suffered from such a level of intoxication as to impair his facility and disable him to identify appellant.\u00a0 In the case of People v. Dee , [63] the credibility of the surviving victim therein as witness was disputed because he was under the influence of liquor at the time of the incident.\u00a0 In Dee, the witness was even found positive for alcoholic breath, but the Court ruled that such fact does not necessarily prevent him from making a positive identification of his attackers, especially since his level of intoxication was not shown to impair his faculties.\u00a0 The credibility of the witness therein was not made to suffer on that score alone. [64]\n\nThe foregoing material considerations, taken together with the fact that witness Garcia and the appellant are not strangers to each other, satisfy us that the danger of\u00a0 Garcia misidentifying the appellant does not exist.\u00a0 Where the prosecution eyewitness was familiar with both victim and accused, and where the locus criminis afforded good visibility, and where no improper motive can be attributed to the witness for testifying against the accused, his version of the story deserves much weight. [65]\n\nHence, we do not find any reason to depart from the general rule that the conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses deserve great respect, viz:\nThe assessment of the credibility of witness and their testimony is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand; and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under examination.\u00a0 Its findings on such matters are binding and conclusive on appellate courts unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted. [66] Appellant's defense of alibi and denial cannot stand in the face of the positive identification of the accused.\u00a0 We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. [67] It is facile to fabricate and difficult to disprove, and is generally rejected. [68]\n\nFor the defense of alibi to prosper, it must be shown with clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the commission of the crime charged, the accused is in a place other than the situs of the crime such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the situs criminis when the crime was committed. [69]\n\nIn the case at bar, appellant was not successful in invoking the defense of alibi.\u00a0 Appellant insists that he was sleeping at his residence at the time when the incident occurred.\u00a0 The RTC and the Court of Appeals consistently found that the distance between appellant's residence and the dance hall, or the situs criminis , is 20 to 30 meters, more or less. [70] Such a distance is negligible.\u00a0 In fact, appellant's wife testified that from their residence, she could see the people dancing at the hall. [71] It was not highly impossible for the appellant to be physically present at the dancing hall at the time of the occurrence of the incident.\u00a0 We, therefore, reject appellant's defense of alibi.\n\nWe shall now determine the criminal liability of the appellant.\n\nTo reiterate, the RTC, in convicting the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, proceeded from a rationalization that there was conspiracy among appellant and his co-accused.\u00a0 It also appreciated the attendance of abuse of superior strength to qualify the crime to Murder.\n\nThe Court of Appeals was unable to agree with the RTC.\u00a0 It found that the conspiracy was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.\u00a0 It ruled that the witness Garcia admitted to not being able to see the stabbing.\u00a0 He could only attest to the clubbing of the victim by appellant with a lead pipe.\u00a0 No proof was shown as to the concerted action of the malefactors of their common design to kill.\u00a0 It, thus, modified the RTC's conviction, and, instead, found appellant guilty of frustrated murder.\n\nThe Amended Information charged the appellant and his co-accused with conspiracy in killing Piamonte.\n\nConspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. [72] Conspiracy as a basis for conviction must rest on nothing less than a moral certainty. [73] Considering the far-reaching consequences of criminal conspiracy, the same degree of proof necessary in establishing the crime is required to support the attendance thereof, i.e ., it must be shown to exist as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the offense itself. [74] Thus, it has been held that neither joint nor simultaneous actions is per se sufficient proof of conspiracy. [75]\n\nWe are, further, guided by the following pronouncement of the Court:\nFor conspiracy to exist, the participants must agree to the commission of the felony and decide to commit it, which agreement may be deduced from the mode and manner of the commission of the offense or inferred from the acts that point to joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of intent. x x x. [76] While conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, it is, nonetheless, required that it be proved by clear and convincing evidence by showing a series of acts done by each of the accused in concert and in pursuance of the common unlawful purpose. [77]\n\nThere is a want of evidence to show the concerted acts of the appellant and his co-accused in pursuing a common design - to kill the deceased, Piamonte.\u00a0 The sole eyewitness for the prosecution, Garcia, was categorical and precise in declaring that he did not see the act of stabbing Piamonte, nor the manner in which Piamonte was stabbed.\u00a0 He later learned that Piamonte died from stab wounds when he saw the latter's dead body covered with stab wounds.\u00a0 The cause of death of Piamonte, as found by the RTC and the Court of Appeals, [78] and as borne by the records, is multiple stab wounds. [79] It was, thus, incumbent on the part of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant and his co-accused acted in concert with a unity of purpose to kill Piamonte.\u00a0 They must show to the satisfaction of this Court the appellant's overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity. [80] They must show that appellant's act of striking Piamonte with a pipe was an intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose. [81]\n\nThe prosecution was unable to show, either by direct or indirect evidence, proof of the agreement among the appellant and his co-accused to warrant conspiracy as a basis for appellant's conviction.\u00a0 No evidence was even adduced to show implied conspiracy.\u00a0 Nothing has been shown that the appellant and his co-accused were \"aimed by their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their combined acts, though apparently independent of each other were, in fact, connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment.\" [82]\n\nThis complete absence of evidence on the part of the prosecution to show the conduct of the appellant and his co-accused, disclosing a common understanding among them relative to the commission of the offense, [83] is fatal to the prosecution.\u00a0 The prosecution's witness could not testify on the manner by which the deceased Piamonte was stabbed, precisely because by his own admission, he did not see the stabbing.\u00a0 No account of the stabbing which caused the death of the deceased Piamonte was ever given nor shown.\u00a0 Unfortunately, no account of how Piamonte died was ever given, except for the established fact that he died due to stabbing.\u00a0 The appellant's act of holding a lead pipe and hitting the deceased in the head was not shown to be in furtherance of the common design of killing the deceased.\u00a0 What transpired during the stabbing of the victim, which is material to proving the fact of conspiracy, is, regrettably, left merely to speculation.\u00a0 This Court must neither conjecture nor surmise that a conspiracy existed. The rule is clear that the guilt of the accused must be proved with moral certainty. [84] All doubts should be resolved in favor of the accused.\u00a0 Thus, the time honored principle in criminal law that if the inculpatory facts are capable of two or more explanations, one consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other with his guilt, the Court should adopt that which is more favorable to the accused for then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty. [85]\n\nLiability of the Accused Bernard Mapalo\n\nThere being no conspiracy, the liability of the appellant will revolve around his individual participation in the event. [86]\n\nIn the case of Li v. People, [87] a street fight ensued resulting in the death of the victim therein. No conspiracy was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The liability of the accused Li who was shown to have struck the victim's right arm with a baseball bat, resulting in a contusion was, thus, determined by the Court in the following manner:\nThe only injury attributable to Li is the contusion on the victim's right arm that resulted from Li striking [the victim] Arugay with a baseball bat.\u00a0 In view of the victim's supervening death from injuries which cannot be attributed to Li beyond reasonable doubt, the effects of the contusion caused by Li are not mortal or at least lie entirely in the realm of speculation.\u00a0 When there is no evidence of actual incapacity of the offended party for labor or of the required medical attendance, the offense is only slight physical injuries, penalized as follows:\n\nx x x x\n\nThe duration of the penalty of arresto menor is from one day to thirty days.\u00a0 The felony of slight physical injuries is necessarily included in the homicide charges.\u00a0 Since the Information against Li states that among the means employed to commit the felonious act was the use of the baseball bat, conviction on the lesser offense or slight physical injuries is proper.\u00a0 There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances established, the imposition of the penalty in its medium period is warranted.\u00a0 Li was convicted by the RTC on January 5, 1994.\u00a0 Having long served more than the imposable penalty, Li is entitled to immediate release unless, of course, he is being lawfully detained for another cause. [88] In the case at bar, no injury was shown to be attributable to the appellant.\u00a0 The only medical evidence that appears on records is the deceased Piamonte's death certificate, [89] which indicates that the cause of death is massive hypovolemia [90] secondary to multiple stab wounds.\u00a0 The factual findings of the RTC and the Court of Appeals coincide to show that the cause of death of Piamonte is multiple stab wounds.\u00a0 Nothing has been shown otherwise.\u00a0 Other than the presence of multiple stab wounds, no other type of injury on the deceased was established.\u00a0 No contusions or injury on the head of the victim or anywhere else in his body caused by a lead pipe was shown.\u00a0 The witness Garcia, in his testimony, merely pointed to stab wounds on the different parts of the body of the deceased. [91] No proof on the injury that was sustained by the deceased that can be attributable to appellant's act was demonstrated.\u00a0 No other physical evidence was proffered. [92]\n\nWe cannot convict appellant of Attempted or Frustrated Murder or Homicide.\u00a0 The principal and essential element of attempted or frustrated homicide or murder is the assailant's intent to take the life of the person attacked. [93] Such intent must be proved clearly and convincingly, so as to exclude reasonable doubt thereof. [94] Intent to kill may be proved by evidence of: (a) motive; (b) the nature or number of weapons used in the commission of the crime; (c) the nature and number of wounds inflicted on the victim; (d) the manner the crime was committed; and (e) words uttered by the offender at the time the injuries are inflicted by him on the victim. [95]\n\nIn the case at bar, no motive on the part of appellant to kill Piamonte was shown either prior or subsequent to the incident.\u00a0 Nor can such intent to kill be inferred from his acts.\u00a0 It bears reiterating that no injury on the body of the deceased was attributed to the appellant's act of hitting the victim with a lead pipe.\u00a0 On the nature of the weapon used, the lead pipe was described by Garcia as one and a half feet in length, and one and a half inches in diameter.\u00a0 The relevant testimony of Garcia on the incident follows:\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now you said that Bernard Mapalo clubbed this Manuel Piamonte. He clubbed him from behind?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And what did he use in clubbing the victim, is it lead pipe?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How long is that lead pipe?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Around this length. (Witness demonstrated 1 1/2 feet).\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And how wide is the diameter?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 \u00bd inches.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What part of his body was hit?\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right side of the head, sir. (Witness showing the right side of his head.) [96] Homicidal intent must be evidenced by the acts that, at the time of their execution, are unmistakably calculated to produce the death of the victim by adequate means. [97] We cannot infer intent to kill from the appellant's act of hitting Piamonte in the head with a lead pipe.\u00a0 In the first place, wounds were not shown to have been inflicted because of the act.\u00a0 Secondly, absent proof of circumstances to show the intent to kill beyond reasonable doubt, this Court cannot declare that the same was attendant.\n\nWhen the offender shall ill-treat another by deed without causing any injury, and without causing dishonor, the offense is Maltreatment under Article 266, [98] par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code.\u00a0 It was beyond reasonable doubt that by hitting Piamonte, appellant ill-treated the latter, without causing any injury.\u00a0 As we have earlier stated, no proof of injury was offered. \u00a0\u00a0Maltreatment is necessarily included in Murder, which is the offense charged in the Information. Thus:\nART. 266. Slight physical injuries and maltreatment. - The crime of slight physical injuries shall be punished:\n\nx x x x\n\n3. By arresto menor in its minimum period or a fine not exceeding 50 pesos when the offender shall ill-treat another by deed without causing any injury. The duration of the penalty of arresto menor in its minimum period is 1 day to 10 days.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated 21 November 2005, in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00408 is MODIFIED .\u00a0 Appellant Bernard Mapalo is ACQUITTED of the charge of MURDER for lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt.\u00a0 He is found GUILTY of the crime of MALTREATMENT, as defined and punished by Article 266, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code.\u00a0 He is accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of arresto menor of 10 days.\u00a0 Considering that appellant has been incarcerated since 2004, which is well-beyond the period of the penalty herein imposed, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons is ordered to cause appellant's IMMEDIATE RELEASE, unless appellant is being lawfully held for another cause, and to inform this Court, within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision, of the compliance therewith.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson),\u00a0 Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Presiding Judge\u00a0 Samuel R.

DECISION AZCUNA, J.: This is an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to annul and set aside the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated August 5, 1999 and January 24, 2000 in CA-G.R. CV No. 53525, entitled \"Bernardino S. Zamora v. Norma Mercado Zamora,\" which affirmed the dismissal of a complaint for declaration of nullity of marriage.The facts[1] are:Petitioner and private respondent were married on June 4, 1970 in Cebu City. After their marriage, they lived together at No. 50-A Gorordo Avenue, Cebu City. The union did not produce any child. In 1972, private respondent left for the United States to work as a nurse. She returned to the Philippines for a few months, then left again in 1974. Thereafter, she made periodic visits to Cebu City until 1989, when she was already a U.S. citizen.Petitioner filed a complaint for declaration of nullity of marriage anchored on the alleged \"psychological incapacity\" of private respondent, as provided for under Article 36 of the Family Code. To support his position, he alleged that his wife was \"horrified\" by the mere thought of having children as evidenced by the fact that she had not borne petitioner a child. Furthermore, he also alleged that private respondent abandoned him by living in the United States and had in fact become an American citizen; and that throughout their marriage they lived together for not more than three years.On the other hand, private respondent denied that she refused to have a child. She portrayed herself as one who loves children as she is a nurse by profession and that she would from time to time borrow her husband's niece and nephews to care for them. She also faulted her husband for the breakup of their marriage, alleging that he had been unfaithful to her. He allegedly had two affairs with different women, and he begot at least three children with them.On June 22, 1995, the trial court rendered its decision thus:. . .Plaintiff consented to defendant's trip to the United States in 1974. She [defendant] wanted to earn money there because she wanted to help her husband build a big house at the Beverly Hills, Cebu City. Defendant's testimony was corroborated by Paulina Martinez, a former househelp of the Zamoras.She always wanted to live in the Philippines before her husband committed infidelity.One reason why defendant seldom saw her husband while she was in the Philippines was because of the infidelity committed by her husband. No less than plaintiff himself admitted that he has a child with a certain [x x x]. The court is also convinced that he has two children with a certain [y y y]. The infidelity on the part of the plaintiff was one of the contributing factors which led to the estranged relationship between him and defendant.... [N]othing in the evidence of plaintiff show[s] that the defendant suffered from any psychological incapacity or that she failed to comply with her essential marital obligations. There is no evidence of psychological incapacity on the part of defendant so that she could not carry out the ordinary duties required in married life. Neither has it been shown that there was an incurable defect on the part of defendant.. . .WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the complaint.Without special pronouncement as to cost.SO ORDERED.[2]Petitioner appealed to the CA which rendered a Decision on August 5, 1999 affirming the ruling of the trial court. The pertinent portions of the CA decision read:...Without delving further into both parties' allegations, we must deny this appeal.In the case of Leouel Santos v. Court of Appeals,[[3]] the High Court ruled that, \"psychological incapacity should refer to no less than a mental (not physical) incapacity x x x and that there is hardly any doubt that the intendment of the law has been to confine the meaning of \"psychological incapacity\" to the most serious cases of personality or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage.\"Also, in Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina,[[4]] it was held that \"mere showing of 'irreconcilable differences' and 'conflicting personalities' in no wise constitutes psychological incapacity. It is not enough to prove that the parties failed to meet their responsibilities and duties as married persons; it is essential that they must be shown to be incapable of doing so, due to some psychological (not physical) illness.\"This appeal does not fall in the category of \"psychological incapacity\" as defined in the aforementioned cases. The mere refusal of the appellee to bear a child is not equivalent to psychological incapacity, since even if such allegation is true, it is not shown or proven that this is due to psychological illness....As correctly stated by the appellee in her brief, the appellant even failed to present any psychologist or other medical expert to prove the psychological incapacity of defendant-appellee. This WE feel is a fatal omission on the part of the appellant, considering the doctrine laid down in the Santos and Molina cases (supra).WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 13 of Cebu City is hereby AFFIRMED. Appeal DISMISSED.SO ORDERED.[5]Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated January 24, 2000.Hence, this petition raising the following issues:1) Whether or not the Court of Appeals misapplied facts of weight and substance affecting the result of the present case;2) Whether or not Article 68 of the Family Code is applicable to this case;3) Whether or not the presentation of psychologists and/or psychiatrists is still desirable, if evidence in this case already shows the psychological incapacity of private respondent;4) Whether or not the presentation of psychologists and/or psychiatrists is still desirable, considering that the private respondent is a resident of the United States and living far away from the Philippines for more than twenty (20) years:5) Whether or not private respondent's refusal to live with petitioner under one roof for more than twenty (20) years, her refusal to bear children with petitioner, and her living a solitary life in the United States for almost three (3) decades are enough indications of psychological incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations under Article 36 of the Family Code.[6]Briefly, the issue is whether there can be a declaration of nullity of the marriage between petitioner and private respondent on the ground of psychological incapacity.Petitioner argues as follows:First, there is nothing in Santos v. CA,[7] upon which private respondent relies, that requires as a conditio sine qua non the presentation of expert opinion of psychologists and psychiatrists in every petition filed under Article 36 of the Family Code. This Court merely said in that case that \"[t]he well-considered opinions of psychiatrists, psychologists, and persons with expertise in psychological disciplines might be helpful or even desirable.\" However, no expert opinion is helpful or even desirable to determine whether private respondent has been living abroad and away from her husband for many years; whether she has a child; and whether she has made her residence abroad permanent by acquiring U.S. citizenship; andSecond, Article 36 of the Family Code provides that a marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. Among the essential marital obligations embraced by Articles 68 to 71 of the same Code is to procreate children through sexual cooperation which is the basic end of marriage. To live together under one roof for togetherness spells the unity in marriage. The marriage had been existing for twenty four years when private respondent filed a legal separation case against petitioner. Throughout this period, private respondent deliberately and obstinately refused to comply with the essential marital obligation to live and cohabit with her husband.This Court rules as follows:It is true, as petitioner noted, that the case of Santos v. CA[8] did not specifically mention that the presentation of expert opinion is a vital and mandatory requirement in filing a petition for the declaration of nullity of marriage grounded on psychological incapacity referred to under Article 36 of the Family Code. Even in the subsequent case of Republic v. Court of Appeals [9] (also known as the Molina case[10]), wherein the Court laid down the guidelines[11] in the interpretation and application of the aforementioned article, examination of the person by a physician in order for the former to be declared psychologically incapacitated was likewise not considered a requirement.[12] What is important, however, as stated in Marcos v. Marcos,[13] is the presence of evidence that can adequately establish the party's psychological condition. If the totality of evidence presented is enough to sustain a finding of psychological incapacity, then actual medical examination of the person concerned need not be resorted to.Likewise, Section 2(d) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC or the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, which took effect on March 15, 2003, states:(d) What to allege. - A petition under Article 36 of the Family Code shall specifically allege the complete facts showing that either or both parties were psychologically incapacitated from complying with the essential marital obligations of marriage at the time of the celebration of marriage even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its celebration.The complete facts should allege the physical manifestations, if any, as are indicative of psychological incapacity at the time of the celebration of the marriage but expert opinion need not be alleged.[14]The rule is that the facts alleged in the petition and the evidence presented, considered in totality, should be sufficient to convince the court of the psychological incapacity of the party concerned. Petitioner, however, failed to substantiate his allegation that private respondent is psychologically incapacitated. His allegations relating to her refusal to cohabit with him and to bear a child was strongly disputed, as the records undeniably bear out. Furthermore, the acts and behavior of private respondent that petitioner cited occurred during the marriage, and there is no proof that the former exhibited a similar predilection even before or at the inception of the marriage.Thus, based on the foregoing, the Court finds no reason to disturb the findings and conclusions reached by the trial court and the CA.WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated August 5, 1999 and January 24, 2000, respectively, in CA-G.R. CV No. 53525 are AFFIRMED.No costs.SO ORDERED.Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, and Garcia, JJ., concur. [1] Rollo, pp. 23-23-b; CA Decision, pp. 1-2. References omitted.[2] CA Rollo, pp. 50-51.[3] 310 Phil. 21 (1995).[4] Republic v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997, 268 SCRA 198.[5] Rollo, pp. 23, 27.[6] Id. at 15-16; Petition for Review on Certiorari, pp. 5-6.[7] Supra note at 3.[8] Id.[9] Supra note 4, at pp. 209-212.[10] The petitioning spouse and co-respondent in the case being Roridel O. Molina.[11] The guidelines in Molina with respect to Article 36 of the Family Code are the following:(1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity. This is rooted in the fact that both our Constitution and our laws cherish the validity of marriage and unity of the family. . . .(2) The root cause of the psychological incapacity must be: (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by experts and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological - not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties[,] or one of them[,] was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of ejusdem generis,[11](3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at \"the time of the celebration\" of the marriage. The evidence must show that the illness was existing when the parties exchanged their \"I do's.\" The manifestation of the illness need not be perceivable at such time, but the illness itself must have attached at such moment[,] or prior thereto.(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or incurable. Such incurability may be absolute or even relative only in regard to the other spouse, not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same sex. Furthermore, such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption of marriage obligations, not necessarily to those not related to marriage, like the exercise of a profession or employment in a job. Hence, a pediatrician may be effective in diagnosing illnesses of children and prescribing medicine to cure them but may not be psychologically capacitated to procreate, bear and raise his/her own children as an essential obligation of marriage.(5) Such illness must be grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Thus, \"mild characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts\" cannot be accepted as root causes. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, there is a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts.nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.Molina had provided for an additional requirement that the Solicitor General issue a certification stating his reasons for his agreement or opposition to the petition. This requirement, however, was dispensed with following the implementation of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC or the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages. Section 11 of the Rule only requires the public prosecutor to file a report confirming that no collusion exists between the parties. Still, Article 48 of the Family Code mandates that the appearance of the prosecuting attorney or fiscal assigned be on behalf of the State to take steps to prevent collusion between the parties and to take care that evidence is not fabricated or suppressed (Antonio v. Reyes, G.R. No. 155800, March 10, 2006, 484 SCRA 353, 375).[12] Marcos v. Marcos, G.R. No. 136490, October 19, 2000, 343 SCRA 755, 764.[13] Id.[14] Emphasis supplied; Section 14(b) of the Rule likewise provides that: \"In case mediation is not availed of or where it fails, the court shall proceed with the pre-trial conference, on which occasion it shall consider the advisability of receiving expert testimony and such other matters as may aid in the prompt disposition of the case.\" Source: Supreme Court E-Library This page was dynamically generated by the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

[5] Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated January 24, 2000.\n\nHence, this petition raising the following issues:\n1) Whether or not the Court of Appeals misapplied facts of weight and substance affecting the result of the present case;\n\n2) Whether or not Article 68 of the Family Code is applicable to this case;\n\n3) Whether or not the presentation of psychologists and/or psychiatrists is still desirable, if evidence in this case already shows the psychological incapacity of private respondent;\n\n4) Whether or not the presentation of psychologists and/or psychiatrists is still desirable, considering that the private respondent is a resident of the United States and living far away from the Philippines for more than twenty (20) years:\n\n5) Whether or not private respondent's refusal to live with petitioner under one roof for more than twenty (20) years, her refusal to bear children with petitioner, and her living a solitary life in the United States for almost three (3) decades are enough indications of psychological incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations under Article 36 of the Family Code. [6] Briefly, the issue is whether there can be a declaration of nullity of the marriage between petitioner and private respondent on the ground of psychological incapacity.\n\nPetitioner argues as follows:\n\nFirst, there is nothing in Santos v.

Even in the subsequent case of Republic v. Court of Appeals [9] (also known as the Molina case [10] ), wherein the Court laid down the guidelines [11] in the interpretation and application of the aforementioned article, examination of the person by a physician in order for the former to be declared psychologically incapacitated was likewise not considered a requirement. [12] What is important, however, as stated in M arcos v. Marcos, [13] is the presence of evidence that can adequately establish the party's psychological condition. If the totality of evidence presented is enough to sustain a finding of psychological incapacity, then actual medical examination of the person concerned need not be resorted to.\n\nLikewise, Section 2(d) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC or the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, which took effect on March 15, 2003, states:\n(d) What to allege. - A petition under Article 36 of the Family Code shall specifically allege the complete facts showing that either or both parties were psychologically incapacitated from complying with the essential marital obligations of marriage at the time of the celebration of marriage even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its celebration.\n\nThe complete facts should allege the physical manifestations, if any, as are indicative of psychological incapacity at the time of the celebration of the marriage but expert opinion need not be alleged. [14] The rule is that the facts alleged in the petition and the evidence presented, considered in totality, should be sufficient to convince the court of the psychological incapacity of the party concerned. Petitioner, however, failed to substantiate his allegation that private respondent is psychologically incapacitated. His allegations relating to her refusal to cohabit with him and to bear a child was strongly disputed, as the records undeniably bear out.\u00a0 Furthermore, the acts and behavior of private respondent that petitioner cited occurred during the marriage, and there is no proof that the former exhibited a similar predilection even before or at the inception of the marriage.\n\nThus, based on the foregoing, the Court finds no reason to disturb the findings and conclusions reached by the trial court and the CA.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated August 5, 1999 and January 24, 2000, respectively, in CA-G.R.

Molina.\n\n[11] The guidelines in Molina with respect to Article 36 of the Family Code are the following:\n\n(1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity. This is rooted in the fact that both our Constitution and our laws cherish the validity of marriage and unity of the family. . . .\n\n(2) The root cause of the psychological incapacity must be: (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by experts and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological - not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties[,] or one of them[,] was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of ejusdem generis, [11]\n\n(3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at \"the time of the celebration\" of the marriage. The evidence must show that the illness was existing when the parties exchanged their \"I do's.\" The manifestation of the illness need not be perceivable at such time, but the illness itself must have attached at such moment[,] or prior thereto.\n\n(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or incurable. Such incurability may be absolute or even relative only in regard to the other spouse, not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same sex. Furthermore, such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption of marriage obligations, not necessarily to those not related to marriage, like the exercise of a profession or employment in a job. Hence, a pediatrician may be effective in diagnosing illnesses of children and prescribing medicine to cure them but may not be psychologically capacitated to procreate, bear and raise his/her own children as an essential obligation of marriage.\n\n(5) Such illness must be grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Thus, \"mild characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts\" cannot be accepted as root causes. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, there is a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.\n\n(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code\u00a0 as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code\u00a0 in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.\n\n(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts.nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.\n\nMolina had provided for an additional requirement that the Solicitor General issue a certification stating his reasons for his agreement or opposition to the petition. This requirement, however, was dispensed with following the implementation of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC or the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages. Section 11 of the Rule only requires the public prosecutor to file a report confirming that no collusion exists between the parties. Still, Article 48 of the Family Code mandates that the appearance of the prosecuting attorney or fiscal assigned be on behalf of the State to take steps to prevent collusion between the parties and to take care that evidence is not fabricated or suppressed ( Antonio v. Reyes, G.R. No. 155800, March 10, 2006, 484 SCRA 353, 375).\n\n[12] Marcos v. Marcos, G.R.

NO. 174277, February 08, 2007 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. SAMUEL DIUNSAY-JALANDONI, APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. SAMUEL DIUNSAY-JALANDONI, APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nBefore us for review is the June 13, 2006 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 01002, which affirmed with modification the March 15, 2005 Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 86, in Criminal Case No. Q-00-91317, finding appellant Samuel Diunsay-Jalandoni guilty of qualified rape; sentencing him to death; and, ordering him to indemnify the victim in the sum of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, and to pay the costs.\n\nAppellant was charged with Rape in an Information [3] dated April 3, 2000 which reads:\nThat on or about the 31 st day of March 2000 in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused with force and intimidation did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of sexual assault upon the person of AAA a retardate by then and there dragging said complainant inside the guard out post located inside xxx Subdivision xxx, this city by removing her shorts and inserting his penis inside her vagina and thereafter had carnal knowledge of her against her will and consent.\nUpon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty, after which, trial on the merits ensued.\n\nThe prosecution presented six (6) witnesses, namely: (1) AAA, the private complainant, (2) BBB, mother of private complainant, (3) Wilfredo Aganon, a construction worker, (4) Chris Pastor, Aganon's co-worker, (5) Dr. Ma. Cristina Morelos, a psychiatrist, and (6) Nimia de Guzman, a psychologist.\n\nThe evidence for the prosecution tends to show that on March 31, 2000 at about 10 o'clock in the morning, Wilfredo Aganon and Chris Pastor, both construction workers, were passing by x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x Subdivision in x x x, Quezon City on the way to their jobsite. \u00a0When they came across a guard outpost, they noticed appellant, an ice cream vendor, pushing AAA on the floor of the outpost and in the act of unzipping his pants. \u00a0From a distance of about 10 meters, Pastor said to appellant, \"Hoy, bawal yan, bitay ang aabutin mo diyan.\"\u00a0 However, the two did not intervene any further and proceeded to walk towards their jobsite.\n\nAAA testified that after appellant pushed her into the outpost and forcibly laid her on its floor, appellant held her thighs and punched her stomach. \u00a0He ordered her to keep silent, otherwise, he would maul and kill her. Thereafter, he unzipped his pants and removed his briefs, and undressed her. \u00a0He then placed himself on top of her, and succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina.\n\nMeanwhile, Aganon and Pastor had not traveled far when they heard AAA shout, \"Tama na po, tama na po, ayaw ko na.\"\u00a0 Upon hearing AAA's cry, Aganon and Pastor went back to the guard outpost. \u00a0Before they could reach the outpost, they saw appellant immediately stand up and ring his ice cream bell while AAA pulled up her short pants. \u00a0Aganon and Pastor then reported the incident to the subdivision guards and homeowners. \u00a0They brought appellant to the Barangay Hall and thereafter turned him over to the x x x Police Station where he was detained pending the filing of formal charges against him.\n\nAfter the rape incident, BBB asked her daughter about the surrounding circumstances leading thereto. \u00a0She found out that this was not the first time that appellant had raped her daughter and that appellant had previously threatened AAA not to reveal to anyone what he had done to her, otherwise, he would harm her.\n\nDr. Ma. Cristina Morelos, a psychiatrist, and Nimia C. De Guzman, a psychologist, both from the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH), testified on the mental capacity of AAA. \u00a0Psychological tests showed that AAA's current mental capacity was at a severe level of mental retardation with the mental age of a four-year old although at the time of the commission of the rape, AAA was already 21 years old. \u00a0She had a very limited attention span and concentration. She was also easily cajoled and pleased, and responded with unthinking eagerness to do anything requested of her as long as her needs were satisfied. \u00a0During her testimony, De Guzman also noted that when she interviewed AAA, the latter answered spontaneously and narrated vividly how she was raped by appellant. \u00a0She pointed out that a person with the mental age of a four-year old could not fabricate a story; and relates events as he or she experiences them. \u00a0Neither could such a person be coached on the witness stand because of his or her limited attention span.\n\nThe defense presented the testimonies of Rosauro Gonzales and appellant himself.\n\nGonzales was presented as a hostile witness it appearing that he was listed as a prosecution witness but was not presented by the prosecution. \u00a0He testified that on March 31, 2000, he was the officer on duty in the Barangay Hall\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 located at x x x, Quezon City; that at around one o'clock in the afternoon, a certain Chris Pastor, together with several others, went to the Barangay Hall to turnover appellant; that he was told that a crime was committed in the guard outpost and Pastor was a witness to its commission; that appellant was subsequently turned over to the x x x Police Station.\n\nAppellant denied the charges against him. \u00a0He claimed that he was selling ice cream at x x x Subdivision in x x x, Quezon City, when AAA approached his ice cream cart to buy ice cream. \u00a0He was not feeling well so he sat down to rest on the guard outpost. \u00a0He claimed that AAA was \"makulit\" and kept on hitting him (\"binubunggo bunggo\") while he was sitting on the floor of the outpost. \u00a0AAA held him by the shoulders so he stood up and pushed her. \u00a0When AAA fell on the floor of the outpost, she was shocked. \u00a0He wanted to help her stand up but she shouted. \u00a0He was about to leave the place when Pastor and Aganon approached him and asked, \"What did you do with the girl?\" to which he replied, \"Wait a moment, how could I do that thing that you are accusing me at this time and place.\"\u00a0 He was then brought to the Barangay Hall and placed in the detention cell. Thereafter, at around one o'clock in the afternoon, he was brought to the Police Station and was placed inside the detention cell without first being interrogated.\n\nOn March 15, 2005, the trial court rendered its Decision convicting appellant of qualified rape. \u00a0It ruled that aside from the use of force, threat or intimidation and the fact that the victim was a mental retardate, the rape was attended with the special qualifying circumstance under Article 266-B(10) [4] of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353, because appellant knew of AAA's mental disability at the time of the commission of the crime as shown by the fact that appellant called AAA \"makulit\" and \"abnormal.\"\u00a0 Thus, it imposed the supreme penalty of death and ordered him to pay damages:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Samuel Diunsay-Jalandoni guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape committed against AAA and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of death, and to indemnify the private complainant the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, plus costs. [5]\nConformably with our ruling in People v. Mateo, [6] the records of this case were forwarded to the Court of Appeals for review. \u00a0On June 13, 2006, the Court of Appeals rendered its assailed Decision affirming appellant's conviction and increasing the amount of civil indemnity from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00:\nWHEREFORE, the appealed DECISION is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Samuel Diunsay-Jalandoni is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of death. He is also ordered to indemnify AAA the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.\nIn his Brief , [7] appellant contends that it was impossible for him to have committed the crime because it was done in broad daylight, along a subdivision street and within the public's view. \u00a0He claims that it is inconceivable for him to have committed such dastardly acts in the guard outpost and in such manner and time, and that even a hardened criminal is not indiscriminate in his actions.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nWe note that the pictures of the guard outpost, as shown by the pictures presented in evidence, [8] had an opening and three side walls which were about waist high. \u00a0The walls of the outpost were high enough to conceal the crime taking place on the floor thereof. \u00a0Thus, there is no merit in appellant's contention that he could not have raped AAA inside the guard outpost because the place was in plain view of passersby.\u00a0 Besides, during the commission of the crime, no other person was traversing the street where the rape took place, aside from Aganon and Pastor.\n\nAs we have often ruled, lust is not a respecter of time and place. \u00a0Rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside a house or where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where there are other members of the family who are sleeping. [9] Indeed, when the bestial passion of man is aroused, rape could be committed anywhere. \u00a0We find, therefore, the commission of the rape on the floor of the guard outpost to be neither impossible nor inconceivable.\n\nAppellant asserts that the prosecution failed to establish the fact of commission of the alleged rape because it failed to present the doctor who conducted the medico-legal examination of AAA.\n\nThe contention lacks merit.\n\nThe records show that after the rape incident, BBB brought AAA to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory in Camp Crame, Quezon City to undergo a medical examination. \u00a0The Initial Medico-Legal Report [10] prepared by Dr. James M. Beljira showed the presence of \"deep healed laceration at 4 o'clock and shallow healed laceration at 9 o'clock positions,\" and was \"negative for spermatozoa.\"\u00a0 The report concluded that AAA is in a \"non-virgin state physically\" and that there are \"no external signs of application of any form of physical trauma.\"\u00a0 However, for reasons not borne by the records, the prosecution failed to present Dr. Beljira to authenticate and affirm the contents of this report.\n\nHowever, this omission is not fatal. In a long line of cases, we have ruled that a medical examination is not essential in the prosecution of a rape case because it is merely corroborative in character. [11] Further, the absence of external signs of violence does not negate the commission of rape. \u00a0Nor is the absence of spermatozoa material in the prosecution of a rape case. \u00a0A freshly broken hymen is, likewise, not an essential element of rape, and healed lacerations do not negate rape because full penetration is not necessary to consummate rape. \u00a0Penetration of the penis by entry into the labia of the pudendum of the vagina, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, is enough to justify a conviction for rape. [12]\n\nWhat matters greatly is the clear, unequivocal and credible testimony of the victim. [13] To be sure, an accused may be convicted on the basis of the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim, provided that her testimony is clear, convincing and otherwise consistent with human nature. In the instant case, we find AAA's unflinching testimony, which related the details of her traumatic experience, coupled with the corroborating testimonies of Aganon and Pastor, who saw appellant with AAA under incriminating circumstances shortly before and soon after the rape incident, to be sufficient for conviction of rape. \u00a0Pertinent portions of AAA's testimony sufficiently described her horrible ordeal thusly:\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did [appellant] approach you on that particular day [March 31, 2000]?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He approached me, sir, then he undressed me. My shorts was removed.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where did this undressing take place?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the guardhouse. He told me to lie down, then he placed himself on top of me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he undressed you, what happened next?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He threatened me that if I will report to my parents, he will kill me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who told you that statement that he will kill you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That man, Mamang ice cream, Manong Samuel.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you were told of this statement, was he holding you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, he abused me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0 When he was holding you, what portion of your body was he holding you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My both thighs.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the accused was holding you what happened next?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He said that he will kill me. He also said he will maul me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After this was made, what happened next?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He said that if I will not keep silent, he will maul me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did the accused maul you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He said, \"uupakan kita pag nagsumbong ka.\"\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did the accused hurt you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What portion of your body did the accused hurt you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He boxed my stomach.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did you do when he boxed your stomach?\nA. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I did not fight back.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What happened next after boxing you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I kicked him and I said it is enough.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why do you say it is enough?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because he was forcing me to lie down in the guardhouse.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Were you able to lie down because of this pressure from the\u00a0 accused?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir, he forced me to lie down.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you were lying down, were you undressed?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While being undressed, what happened?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He removed my shorts, he tore it?\n\nx x x x\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did the accused also undress in your presence?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ. \u00a0\u00a0 What particular clothes were taken off by the accused?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His briefs.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And after undressing his briefs, what did he do to you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He placed himself on top of me.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did it hurt when he placed his body on top of you?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In what part of the body did it hurt?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0 He inserted something on my private part (witness pointing to her private part).\n\nQ. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you identify the thing that was inserted on your private part?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 His private organ.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you inform the Court what is the shape of the private organ?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He inserted it on my private part.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After inserting it in your private part, what did he do next?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He inserted it.\n\nQ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After inserting his private part on your private part, what did the accused do?\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He inserted his private part on my private part. [14]\nDuring AAA's testimony, the trial court noted that there were instances when she could not immediately comprehend the questions propounded to her, and that she was sometimes repetitious in her answers. These were attributed to her mental condition as she was found to be suffering from severe mental retardation with the mental age of a four-year old although she was already 21 years old at the time of the commission of the rape. \u00a0Despite this, the trial court found AAA's testimony to be spontaneous, credible and replete with details of her ordeal at the hands of appellant. \u00a0It observed that given AAA's low mental age, it is improbable that she could concoct or fabricate such a serious charge of rape. \u00a0Neither was it possible that she was coached into testifying against appellant considering her limited attention span and concentration. \u00a0Under such circumstances, only a very startling event would leave a lasting impression on her which she would be able to recall when asked about it.\n\nWe sustain the above findings of the trial court under the settled rule that appellate courts will not disturb the findings of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses considering that it is in a better position to observe their candor and behavior on the witness stand. \u00a0Evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor, conduct and attitude. \u00a0Its assessment is respected unless certain facts of substance and value were overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case. [15] These exceptions are not present in this case.\n\nWe now determine the appropriate penalty.\n\nThe trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, convicted appellant for qualified rape and sentenced him to death under Article 266-B(10) [16] of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353. \u00a0It reasoned that appellant knew of AAA's mental retardation at the time of the commission of the rape since, during his testimony, appellant referred to AAA as the \"makulit\" and \"abnormal\" person who kept on annoying him while he rested in the guard outpost. [17]\n\nIndeed, under Article 266-B(10), knowledge by the offender of the mental disability of the offended party at the time of the commission of the rape is a special qualifying circumstance that sanctions the imposition of the death penalty. [18] However, the long settled rule is that qualifying circumstances must be sufficiently alleged in the indictment and proved during trial to be properly appreciated by the trial court. \u00a0Otherwise, it would be a denial of the right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him, and, thus, a denial of due process, if he is charged with simple rape but is convicted of its qualified form even if the attendant qualifying circumstance is not set forth in the information. [19] In the instant case, the information merely states that AAA is a retardate without specifically stating that appellant knew of her mental disability at the time of the commission of the rape. \u00a0Thus, appellant can only be convicted of simple rape under Article 266-A, par. 1 [20] in relation to 266-B [21] of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, and his sentence should be accordingly reduced to reclusion perpetua.\n\nAnent the award of damages, the Court of Appeals awarded to the victim P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages. However, with our finding that appellant should be convicted of simple rape only and not of qualified rape, the civil indemnity must be reduced to P50,000.00 conformably with prevailing jurisprudence. [22] Nonetheless, AAA is entitled to P25,000.00 as exemplary damages pursuant to our ruling in People v. Catubig . [23] In Catubig, we held that the presence of an aggravating circumstance, whether ordinary or qualifying, entitles the offended party to an award of exemplary damages. \u00a0Further, we noted in that case that the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which took effect on December 1, 2000, now requires that aggravating circumstances must be alleged in the information in order to be validly appreciated by the court. However, the retroactive application of these procedural rules cannot adversely affect the rights of a private offended party that have become vested where the offense was committed prior to the effectivity of said rules [24] as is the case here. \u00a0Consequently, aggravating circumstances which were not alleged in the information but proved during the trial may be appreciated for the limited purpose of determining appellant's liability for exemplary damages. [25] In the instant case, the presence of the qualifying circumstance of knowledge by the offender of the offended party's mental disability, although not alleged in the information, was proved during trial, which justifies the award of exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 in consonance with current rulings. [26]\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 01002 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Appellant is found GUILTY of simple rape and sentenced to reclusion perpetua; he is ordered to indemnify the victim in the sum of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay the costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Garcia, and V elasco, Jr. JJ., concur.\nCorona, and Nachura, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 2-20.\u00a0 Penned by Associate Justice Eliezer R.

STA. RITA, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nPRUDENTIAL SHIPPING AND MANAGEMENT CORPORATION AND ZENITH SHIPPING INVESTMENT, LTD., PETITIONERS, VS. EMERLINDA A. STA. RITA, FOR HERSELF AND IN BEHALF OF RENE A. STA. RITA, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 80610, which reversed the decision and resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision, as well as the CA Resolution [2] denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.\n\nOn May 5, 1999, petitioner Zenith Shipping Investment, Ltd. (ZSIL), through petitioner Prudential Shipping and Management Corporation (PSMC), hired Virgilio C. Sta. Rita as \"oiler\" on board the M/V Gulfwind. The contract was for 12 months at a basic monthly salary of US$335.00 on a 48-hour work week, with an overtime pay of US$2.01 per hour and a monthly vacation leave with pay of 4 days. [3] In his pre-employment medical examination, he was found fit for sea duty, although his electrocardiogram (ECG) report revealed a mild left axis deviation. [4]\n\nVirgilio boarded ship on May 20, 1999. [5] He became ill while on board. On March 3, 2000, the Marine Medical Unit at New Orleans, Louisiana, USA diagnosed him to be suffering from umbilical hernia. The attending physician advised Virgilio to avoid tasks involving heavy lifting and to undergo surgical repair. [6] He was later repatriated.\n\nUpon his arrival in Manila on March 8, 2000, Virgilio was immediately referred to the company-designated physicians at the Metropolitan Hospital for further evaluation and management. He was found positive of peri-umbilical mass [7] due to the presence of ascites. [8] On March 24, 2000, Virgilio was subjected to umbilical herniorrhapy [9] (surgical repair), ultrasound of the upper abdomen [10] and aspiration of ascitic fluid. [11] The ultrasound done on the day of the operation further revealed that Virgilio had liver cirrhosis with a possible regenerating nodule, [12] for which he was given medication. [13] Five days later, or on March 29, 2000, he was discharged from the hospital. [14] All medical and hospitalization expenses for the herniorrhapy were shouldered by petitioners.\n\nOn June 20, 2000, after several post-operation check-ups, Virgilio signed a \"Certificate of Fitness for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work\" [15] where he released his employer and the manning company from all actions, claims and liabilities. [16] ZSIL and PSMC later paid his sick wages. [17]\n\nAlmost eight (8) months later, on February 13, 2001, Virgilio was brought to the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). His HBT ultrasonography (of the liver and gallbladder) revealed massive ascites, liver cirrhosis, thickening of the gallbladder wall (probably reactive) and splenomegaly, while his chest ultrasonography revealed left massive pleural effusion. [18] On electrocardiogram, he was discovered to have sinus tachycardia and left axis deviation. [19] His roentgenological report further revealed an atherosclerotic aorta which confirmed the earlier finding of pleural effusion. [20] On March 13, 2001, he was confined at the PGH for \"acidosis secondary to liver cirrhosis probably secondary to alcoholic liver disease; hepatocellular carcinoma and left pleural effusion, probably malignant.\" [21] Virgilio died on March 18, 2001. The immediate cause of\u00a0 death was \"cardiopulmonary arrest 2 o metabolic acidosis r/o fatal arrhythmia,\" with \"acute renal failure\" as the antecedent cause, and \"hepatocellular carcinoma\" as the underlying cause. [22]\n\nOn June 5, 2001, Emerlinda, Virgilio's wife, [23] and Rene, their son [24] (respondents), filed a complaint [25] against ZSIL and PSMC for payment of death compensation, illness allowance, reimbursement of medical expenses, damages and attorney's fees before the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u00a0case\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0was \u00a0docketed \u00a0as \u00a0NLRC-NCR-OFW-Case \u00a0No. (M)-01-06-1049-00.\n\nPetitioners countered that respondents were not entitled to death benefits because Virgilio died long after his employment had been terminated. This was in accordance with Section 18 of the POEA Standard Employment Contract. Petitioners argued that they were not insurers of the lives of seamen and they were only liable for death benefits for the results of illnesses contracted during employment. They pointed out that respondents were already given residual benefits from Virgilio's repatriation due to illness, and as such, the former were already released from any obligation to the heirs of the deceased.\u00a0 They likewise averred that death benefits are awarded only if the seaman dies of the same illness for which he was repatriated.\u00a0 In this case, he was repatriated due to umbilical hernia which is not a deadly illness; in fact, Virgilio's condition had already been corrected by umbilical herniorrhapy from which he recuperated fully. Furthermore, he was later on declared fit to work.\u00a0 Petitioners stressed that the deceased was in good health when he was repatriated. \u00a0Finally, they claim that they are not \u00a0liable for damages because they acted in good faith.\u00a0 They rejected the claims of the respondents on the honest belief that they were not entitled thereto under the POEA Standard Employment Contract.\n\nIn their Reply, respondents averred that petitioners' settlement of the sick wages and their other liabilities to Virgilio was contrary to their claim that Virgilio's employment had been terminated upon repatriation.\n\nOn June 21, 2002, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision [26] in favor of the respondents. The Labor Arbiter ruled that the nature of Virgilio's employment contributed to the aggravation of his affliction, which in turn caused his premature repatriation for medical treatment, and eventually his death. While his hernia operation was successful, the liver cirrhosis, which had been diagnosed during the operation, remained. The fallo of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering herein respondents Prudential Shipping and Management Corporation and Zenith Shipping Investment, Inc., jointly and severally, to pay herein surviving spouse complainant Emerlinda A. Sta. Rita and her child, Rene, surnamed Sta. Rita, the following:\nThe sum of US$1,340.00 as sickness allowance;\n\nThe sum of US$50,000.00 as death compensation benefits, plus the sum of US$7,000.00 for herein minor child Rene;\n\nThe sum of US$1,000.00 burial expenses; and\n\nThe further sum of ten percent (10%) of the monetary award due complainant, or US$5,934.00, as attorney's fees.\nAll other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [27]\nThe Labor Arbiter further held that a claim arising from employer-employee relationship does not necessarily infer that the relationship should\u00a0 exist at the time the claim is presented. \u00a0Although the employment may have ceased, the origin of the claim is not altered. According to the Labor Arbiter, the fact that Virgilio's employment had already been terminated when the complaint was filed is of no consequence. He cited this Court's rulings in Martin v. Court of Appeals, [28] and Star Security & Detective Investigation Agency v. Secretary of Labor. [29]\n\nPetitioners appealed the decision to the NLRC, wherein they averred that:\nFIRST, the Honorable Arbiter appears to have awarded sickness allowance to complainant, a relief which has not been substantiated, which at best has been waived because the same was not prayed for in the Position Paper and Reply filed by the complainant\u00a0 before the Arbiter, and which in fact has been paid;\n\nSECOND, the Honorable Arbiter adopted a version of the facts that is at best speculative and baseless, and at worse, contrary to the evidence presented; and\n\nTHIRD, the deceased seaman died long after his employment of a disease which did not manifest during such employment, and which is a known fatal and fast acting illness, such that the respondents cannot be held liable for death benefits and damages including attorney's fees arising therefrom. [30]\nOn May 26, 2003, the NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and dismissed the complaint. [31] According to the NLRC, death and burial benefits could not be awarded to respondents. \u00a0Under the POEA Standard Employment Contract, these benefits are given if the seafarer died during the term of his contract. Since the seafarer passed away one year after his repatriation ( i.e ., his contract was already terminated), respondents were not entitled to death benefits.\n\nThe NLRC, likewise, ruled that respondents were not entitled to sickness allowance because they did not pray for such relief in their position paper. \u00a0In fact, petitioners attached to their appeal memorandum evidence that sickness allowance had been paid to respondents. \u00a0The fallo of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED, and the instant case DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [32]\nRespondents filed a motion for reconsideration [33] which the NLRC denied. [34] This prompted the respondents (petitioners for brevity) to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court before the CA. [35] Petitioners insisted that the public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of its jurisdiction in reversing and setting aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter and in dismissing their complaint. [36]\n\nThey averred that, although Virgilio died of cardiopulmonary arrest one year from the date of his repatriation, they were still entitled to death benefits. Citing the ruling in Ijares v. Court of Appeals, [37] they averred that the main consideration for compensability is that the cause of death of the deceased was contracted during and by reason of his employment, and any non-work related factor that contributed to its aggravation is immaterial. What is decisive is that the cause of death of the deceased is work-related and aggravated his condition or contributed, even in a small degree, to its development. \u00a0Petitioners pointed out that the deceased was an oiler and was exposed to different kinds of chemicals and extreme heat in the engine room of the vessel. Contrary to respondents' contention, the deceased was not yet well when he was repatriated because he was found suffering from enlargement of the abdomen five (5) days after the surgery on his umbilical hernia.\u00a0 He could not have contracted liver cirrhosis, the underlying cause of his death, only after he was repatriated; he contracted it during the time of his employment with petitioners. They claimed that respondents cannot find solace in the Certificate of Fitness executed by the deceased because the same is in the nature of a deed of quitclaim and cannot bar the recovery of death benefits.\n\nOn October 26, 2004, the appellate court rendered judgment granting the petition. [38] It declared that the cause of Virgilio's death was traceable to his cirrhosis, which he presumably acquired while he was in petitioners' employ. \u00a0Virgilio worked in the engine room where he was necessarily exposed to chemicals. Also, his strenuous work as an oiler might have weakened his state of health; his having skipped meals to attend to his work might have rendered him susceptible to malnutrition. It stressed that hepatocellular carcinoma may arise as a complication of cirrhosis. The dispositive portion of the CA decision reads:\nUPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS, the assailed decision and resolution of the NLRC must be, as they hereby are, REVERSED, and the June 21, 2002 judgment of Labor Arbiter Salimathar V. Nambi REINSTATED in toto. Without costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [39]\nPetitioners filed a motion for reconsideration [40] which the appellate court denied in its January 6, 2005 Resolution. [41]\n\nPetitioners thus filed the instant petition assailing the ruling of the appellate court on the following grounds:\nThe appellate court disregarded the terms and conditions of the POEA Standard Employment Contract when it rendered petitioners liable for the seaman's death which occurred after (sic)\u00a0\u00a0 long after the POEA Contract had been terminated.\n\nThe appellate court erred in ruling that deceased Sta. Rita's illness\u00a0\u00a0 which caused his death allegedly occurred during his employment\u00a0\u00a0 and/or the risk of contracting the disease was increased or aggravated by his employment since there was no evidence in this\u00a0\u00a0 respect.\n\nThe appellate court erred in ruling for the respondents despite clear proof that the cause of death was entirely different from the \u00a0 illness with which the deceased was repatriated. [42]\nThe threshold issue is whether or not respondents are entitled to death and sickness benefits from petitioners on account of Virgilio's death on March 18, 2001.\n\nPetitioners aver that, for respondents to be entitled to the death benefits in the POEA Standard Employment Contract, the death of the seafarer must occur during the term of the contract.\u00a0 When the seafarer dies after the termination of his employment but was suffering from an injury or illness during the term of his contract, the heirs would be entitled only to the compensation and benefits under Section 20(B) of the Contract. The cause of Virgilio's death which was cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, had no connection with umbilical hernia for which he was repatriated in March 2000.\u00a0 Petitioners stress that the cause of Virgilio's death was entirely different from the illness for which he was repatriated. His death further occurred long after the termination of his contract due to repatriation, after his successful operation and after he had been declared fit to resume his duties. Moreover, the illnesses that caused his demise were in no way related to hernia, nor were these aggravated by his work as an oiler. Even his cirrhosis was not caused by the nature of his work, as his own doctor opined that this was due to alcoholic liver disease caused by excessive alcohol intake which developed over a long period of time. The mere fact that Virgilio was found fit to work during his pre-employment medical examination does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the illness that caused his death was acquired during the course of employment. There is, likewise, no evidence on record to prove that Virgilio was exposed to chemicals or that he skipped meals while working. \u00a0Since there was no basis for the CA to conclude a work-connection or work-aggravation, petitioners should not be held liable for death and funeral benefits. Also, they should not be made to pay sickness allowance, as this was already given to Virgilio, nor damages and attorney's fees, for petitioners faithfully complied with their obligation when the deceased became ill while on board. No premium should further be placed on the right to litigate.\n\nIn their comment on the petition, respondents averred that the issues raised by petitioners are factual, which are improper in a petition for review on certiorari .\u00a0 Respondents reiterated that even if Virgilio died after his employment with respondents had already been terminated, petitioners are nevertheless liable for the death benefits.\u00a0 This is in accordance with the ruling of this Court in Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al. v. National Labor Relations Commission. [43] Respondents, likewise, maintained that the decision of the CA is in accord with law and the evidence on record.\n\nRespondents contend that there is a causal relationship between Virgilio's death and his employment with petitioners. In several cases decided by the court, death compensation was awarded despite the fact that the death of the seaman occurred after the expiration of his employment contract. While Virgilio was indeed repatriated due to hernia, he was also diagnosed to be ill of liver cirrhosis. The existence of such a disease during the term of his contract entitles respondents to compensation for death benefits. They insisted that Virgilio's exposure to chemicals and toxins as an oiler contributed to the development or aggravation of his illness. Respondents claim that in compensation proceedings, the ultimate degree of certainty is not required to establish the claim. It is enough that the theory in which the claimants anchor their claim is probable, considering the circumstances surrounding the case. Respondents are not duty bound to prove work-connection since the 1996 POEA Standard Employment Contract does not require that the illness must be work-related to be compensable.\u00a0 The unjustified refusal of petitioners to pay their claim amounted to bad faith and malice, thus, they are liable for damages and attorney's fees.\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nIn petitions for review on certiorari, only questions of law may be raised, the only exceptions being when the factual findings of the appellate court are erroneous, absurd, speculative, conjectural, conflicting, or contrary to the findings culled by the court of origin. [44] Considering the conflicting findings of the NLRC, the CA and the Labor Arbiter, the Court is impelled to resolve the factual issues in this case along with the legal ones.\n\nSection 20(A)(1) and (4) (A, B and C) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract\u00a0 provides:\nSection 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nA. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR DEATH\n\n1. In case of death of the seafarer during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine Currency equivalent to the amount of Fifty Thousand US dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty-one (21) but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.\n\nx x x x\n\n4. The other liabilities of the employer when the seafarer dies as a result of injury or illness during the term of employment are as follows:\nThe employer shall pay the deceased's beneficiary all outstanding obligations due the seafarer under this Contract.\n\nThe employer shall transport the remains and personal effects of the seafarer to the Philippines at employer's expense except if the death occurred in a port where local government laws or regulations do not permit the transport of such remains. In case death occurs at sea, the disposition of the remains shall be handled or dealt with in accordance with the master's best judgment. In all cases, the employer/master shall communicate with the manning agency to advice for disposition of seafarer's remains.\n\nThe employer shall pay the beneficiaries of the seafarer the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of One Thousand US dollars (US$1,000) for burial expenses at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.\nThe death of a seaman during the term of employment makes the employer liable to his heirs for death compensation benefits.\u00a0 Once it is established that the seaman died during the effectivity of his employment contract, the employer is liable. [45] However, if the seaman dies after the termination of his contract of employment, his beneficiaries are not entitled to the death benefits enumerated above. [46]\n\nSection 18(B) (1 to 4) of the Contract further provides that the employment of the seafarer is terminated upon his sign-off; in case he is disembarked for medical treatment pursuant to Section 18(B)(1) of the Contract, the employer shall bear the full cost of repatriation in the event the seafarer is fit for repatriation.\n\nIn the present case, Virgilio was repatriated for medical reasons; he arrived in the Philippines on March 8, 2000 for surgical repair after he was diagnosed with umbilical hernia. Virgilio's employment was thus terminated upon his repatriation on March 8, 2000.\u00a0 Consequently, when he died on March 18, 2001, his employment with petitioners had long been terminated.\u00a0 Hence, respondents are not entitled to receive death benefits under the Contract from petitioners. [47]\n\nNeither are petitioners liable for sickness allowance since it appears from the records that these had already been paid to respondents in June and September 2000, and January 2001. [48]\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING , the petition is GRANTED .\u00a0 The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 80610 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE .\u00a0 The Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission is REINSTATED .\u00a0 No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez, and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Renato C.

NO. 161594, February 08, 2007 ]\n\nFERTILIZER AND PESTICIDE AUTHORITY (FPA), PETITIONER, VS. MANILA PEST CONTROL COMPANY (MAPECON) AND WOODROW CATAN, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nFERTILIZER AND PESTICIDE AUTHORITY (FPA), PETITIONER, VS. MANILA PEST CONTROL COMPANY (MAPECON) AND WOODROW CATAN, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPUNO, CJ.:\n\nOn appeal are the Decision [1] dated July 31, 2003 and the Resolution [2] dated January 8, 2004 of the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. CV No. 67175.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dumaguete City, which ruled that the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) did not have jurisdiction or regulatory power over the acts and business operations of Manila Pest Control Company (MAPECON).\n\nPetitioner FPA is an attached agency of the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0 It was created pursuant to Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1144, \"Creating the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority and Abolishing the Fertilizer Industry Authority,\" that took effect on May 30, 1977.\n\nRespondent MAPECON is a franchised and licensed urban pest control operator, and duly accredited by the National Committee on Urban Pest Control (NCUPC).\u00a0 MAPECON and its branches nationwide are licensed and accredited to engage in the manufacture, distribution, and application of its 38 patented pest control products.\u00a0 It has operated its urban pest control business since the 1960s.\u00a0 Respondent Woodrow Catan is the MAPECON Dumaguete City branch manager.\n\nUpon the request of Pablo Turtal, Jr., Manager of Supreme Pest Control (SUPESCON) who was holding office in Sibulan, Negros Oriental, Vicente La\u00f1ohan, the FPA Dumaguete Office Provincial Coordinator, issued an undated certificate that MAPECON-Dumaguete City branch had no license to operate, and that its pesticide products were not registered with the FPA.\u00a0 Thus, it could not engage in pest control operation \"until such time that this above-mentioned business entity can secure a license from the [FPA].\" [3] La\u00f1ohan also sent a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, Dumaguete Office, dated December 29, 1993, wherein he requested the office to suspend the processing, approval, and/or release of the business trade name registration of MAPECON because of its alleged violation of the provisions of P.D. No. 1144. [4]\n\nUsing the certificate issued by La\u00f1ohan, Turtal sent letters to respondents' current and prospective clients, urging them to desist from dealing with respondent MAPECON.\u00a0 As a result, respondent claimed that it was disqualified and prohibited from participating in several private and public biddings, and that almost all of the winning bids had been awarded to SUPESCON, the pest control business of\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Turtal.\n\nRespondents MAPECON and Catan filed a complaint [5] on January 18, 1994, for injunction with a prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction and/or restraining order and damages, against Vicente La\u00f1ohan and Pablo Turtal, Jr., before the RTC of Dumaguete City. \u00a0Respondents sought to enjoin La\u00f1ohan and Turtal from disturbing their business operations and from requiring them to obtain a license from the FPA; and to desist from prohibiting respondents from participating in any and all private and public biddings.\u00a0 Respondents also sought payment of damages for the alleged evident bad faith of La\u00f1ohan and Turtal, who had allegedly conspired in easing respondents out of business.\n\nIn an Order dated January 19, 1994, the trial court restrained La\u00f1ohan and Turtal, their agents, and all persons acting for them, for 20 days, \"from stopping and disturbing in any form, the business operation of plaintiffs as described in said complaint, from requiring plaintiffs to obtain a license and/or permit from the [FPA], and to cease and desist immediately from prohibiting plaintiffs from participating in any and all private and public bidding related to its business.\" [6]\n\nOn January 27, 1995, respondents MAPECON and Catan filed an amended complaint, [7] which impleaded the FPA and its officers Francisco C. Cornejo and Nicholas R. Deen, Executive Director III and Deputy Executive Director III, respectively, as defendants. \u00a0Respondents alleged in their amended complaint that Cornejo and Deen, as officers of the FPA, had also sent letters to several clients of MAPECON, advising them to desist from dealing with the company, because it had no license to engage in pest control.\u00a0 Respondents further claimed that, despite knowledge of the pendency of the instant case, Cornejo and Deen had issued certifications and released news items stating, among other things, that MAPECON had no license to operate from the FPA.\u00a0 Lastly, respondents MAPECON and Catan alleged that they were being eased out of business, and that their good name and reputation were being destroyed by Cornejo and Deen, in connivance with the other defendants.\n\nOn March 9, 2000, the RTC ruled in favor of respondents MAPECON and Catan. \u00a0The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations and finding the restraining order prayed for by the plaintiff to be meritorious and well-founded, it is hereby ordered that defendants Vicente La\u00f1ohan as an agent of FPA and Pablo Turtal, Jr. as the Manager of SUPESCON and their representatives and other persons working for and in their behalf, to cease and desist immediately from stopping and disturbing in any form the business operations of the plaintiff, from requiring plaintiff to obtain a license and/or permit from the FPA and from prohibiting plaintiff from participating in any and all private and public biddings related to its business.\u00a0 No pronouncement as to damages and costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8]\nPetitioner and Vicente La\u00f1ohan appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision of the trial court.\u00a0 The appellate court also denied petitioner and La\u00f1ohan's motion for reconsideration.\n\nHence, this appeal. \u00a0Petitioner raises a lone issue for resolution, which is whether the acts or business operations of respondent MAPECON are under the jurisdiction or regulatory power of petitioner FPA.\n\nIn defending its jurisdiction, petitioner FPA invokes P.D. No. 1144 which created it.\u00a0 It cites Sections 8 and 9 of said law, to wit:\nSection 8 . Prohibitions Governing Sale and Use of Fertilizers and Pesticides . It shall be unlawful for any handler of pesticides, fertilizer, and other agricultural chemicals or for any farmers, planter or end-user of the same as the case may be:\n\n(a) To engage in any form of production, importation, distribution, storage and sale in commercial quantities without securing from the FPA a license therefor;\n\n(b) To use any pesticide or pesticide formulation on crops, livestock, and the environment in a manner contrary to good agricultural practices as hereinabove defined;\n\n(c) To deal in pesticides and/or fertilizers which have not been previously registered with FPA, or which registration has expired or has been suspended or revoked;\n\n(d) To adulterate pesticides formulation and fertilizer grade;\n\n(e) To impose as a condition for the purchase of fertilizer, the simultaneous purchase of pesticide for other agricultural chemical inputs and vice-versa;\n\n(f) To mislabel or make claims which differ in substance from the representation made in connection with a product's registration or from its actual effectiveness; and\n\n(g) To violate such other rules and regulations as may be promulgated by FPA.\n\nSection 9. Registration and Licensing . No pesticides, fertilizers, or other agricultural chemical shall be exported, imported, manufactured, formulated, stored, distributed, sold or offered for sale, transported, delivered for transportation or used unless it has been duly registered with the FPA or covered by a numbered provisional permit issued by FPA for use in accordance with the conditions as stipulated in the permit. Separate registrations shall be required for each active ingredient and its possible formulations in the case of pesticides or for each fertilizer grade in the case of fertilizer.\n\nNo person shall engage in the business of exporting, importing, manufacturing, formulating, distributing, supplying, repacking, storing, commercially applying, selling, marketing, of any pesticides, fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals except under a license issued by the FPA.\n\nThe FPA, in the pursuit of its duties and functions, may suspend, revoke, or modify the registration of any pesticide, fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals after due notice and hearing.\nPetitioner also cites Ministry of Health Administrative Order No. 39, s. 1979, which delisted \"pesticide, insecticide and other economic poisons as household hazardous substances under Category V\" from those subject to the licensing and registration requirements of the Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0According to the Administrative Order, \"under [P.D.] No. 1144 dated May 30, 1977, creating the [FPA], it was found desirable 'to have one Agency to regulate . . . pesticide labelling, distribution, storage, transportation, use and disposal.'\" [9]\n\nFurther, petitioner invokes the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated July 15, 1980 between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the FPA, represented by then Ministry of Agriculture, which stated that the FPA shall have jurisdiction over the registration of household pesticides, insecticides and other economic poisons; the registration of handlers of household pesticides; and the accreditation of all commercial pest control operators.\n\nLastly, petitioner argues that P.D. No. 1144, which requires the registration of pesticides with, and the licensing of their handlers by the FPA, is a special law.\u00a0 On the contrary, the laws invoked by respondents are laws of general application which cannot excuse respondent MAPECON from complying with a special law.\n\nRespondents, on the other hand, contend that their products are duly patented with the Philippine Patent Office and registered with the MOH per P.D. No. 552 (Sanitation in Tourist Facilities), P.D. No. 865 (New Sanitation Code), and Health Circular No. 155, s. 1975.\u00a0 Respondents' products are also registered with the Ministry of Public Works per P.D. No. 1096 (New Building Code), the Ministry of Labor per P.D. No. 442 (Labor Code), and with the Philippine Investors and the Ministry of Finance per P.D. No. 1423 (Philippine Inventors Incentive Act).\n\nWe affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\nWe hold that the FPA has jurisdiction only over\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0agricultural pesticides, not over urban pest control products.\u00a0 \"Pesticides\" in P.D. No. 1144 refer only to those used in farming and other agricultural activities, as distinguished from pesticides used in households, business establishments, and offices in urban areas.\u00a0 The preamble of P.D. No. 1144 provides the first glimpse of this interpretation.\u00a0 It reads as follows:\nWHEREAS, it is Government policy to provide adequate assistance to the agricultural sector in line with the national objective of increasing food production;\n\nWHEREAS, fertilizer and pesticides are vital inputs in food production and must be supplied in adequate quantities at reasonable costs;\n\nWHEREAS, improper pesticide usage presents serious risks to users, handlers, and the public in general because of the inherent toxicity of these compounds which are, moreover, potential environmental contaminants;\n\nWHEREAS, there is a need to educate the agricultural sector on the benefits as well as the hazards of pesticide use so that it can utilize pesticides properly to promote human welfare while avoiding dangers to health and environmental pollution;\n\nWHEREAS, the fertilizer and pesticide industries have much in common in terms of clientele, distribution channels, system of application in farmers' fields, and technical supervision by the same farm management technicians under the government's food production program ;\n\nWHEREAS, the foregoing considerations make it desirable to have one agency to regulate fertilizer importation, manufacture, formulation, distribution, delivery, sale, transport and storage as well as pesticide labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, use and disposal;\n\nWHEREAS, the Fertilizer Industry Authority was created by Presidential Decree No. 135, dated 22 February 1973, and amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 517 and 669, dated 19 July 1974 and 11 March 1975 respectively, in order to regulate, control and develop the fertilizer industry but does not include the pesticide industry in its jurisdiction;\n\nWHEREAS, there is an urgent need to create a technically-oriented government authority equipped with the required expertise to regulate, control and develop both the fertilizer and the pesticide industries;\n\n[Emphases supplied.]\nFurther, P.D. No. 1144 uses the term \"pesticides\" always in conjunction with \"fertilizers\" or with the phrase \"fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals/chemical inputs\" or the phrase \"other agricultural chemicals,\" thus:\nSection 6. Powers and Functions. The FPA shall have jurisdiction, on over all existing handlers of pesticides, fertilizers and other agricultural chemical inputs . The FPA shall have the following powers and functions:\n\nI. Common to Fertilizers, Pesticides and other Agricultural Chemicals.\n. . .\n\n(2) To promote and coordinate all fertilizer and pesticides research in cooperation with the Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research and other appropriate agencies to ensure scientific pest control in the public interest, safety in the use and handling of pesticides, higher standards and quality of products and better application methods;\n. . .\n\nIII. Pesticides and Other Agricultural Chemicals\n\n(1) To determine specific uses or manners of use for each pesticide or pesticide formulation;\n\n(2) To establish and enforce tolerance levels and good agricultural practices for use of pesticides in raw agricultural commodities ;\n\n(3) To restrict or ban the use of any pesticide or the formulation of certain pesticides in specific areas or during certain periods upon evidence that the pesticide is an imminent hazard, has caused, or is causing widespread serious damage to crops, fish or livestock, or to public health and the environment;\n\n(4) To prevent the importation of agricultural commodities containing pesticide residues above the\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0accepted tolerance levels and to regulate the exportation of agricultural products containing pesticide residue above accepted tolerance levels;\n\n(5) To inspect the establishment and premises of pesticide handlers to insure that industrial\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0health and safety rules and anti-pollution regulations are followed;\n\n(6) To enter and inspect farmers' fields to ensure that only the recommended pesticides are used in specific crops in accordance with good agricultural practice;\n\n(7) To require if and when necessary, of every handler of these products, the submission to the FPA of a report stating the quantity, value of each kind of product exported, imported, manufactured, produced, formulated, repacked, stored, delivered, distributed, or sold;\n\n(8) Should there be any extraordinary and unreasonable increases in price or a severe shortage in supply of pesticides, or imminent dangers or either occurrences, the FPA is empowered to impose such controls as may be necessary in the public interest, including but not limited to such restrictions and controls as the imposition of price ceilings, controls on inventories, distribution, and transport, and tax-free importations of such pesticides or raw materials thereof as may be in short supply.\n. . .\n\nSection 8. Prohibitions Governing Sale and Use of Fertilizers and Pesticides. It shall be unlawful for any handler of pesticides, fertilizer, and other agricultural chemicals or for any farmers, planter or end-user of the same as the case may be:\n\n(a) To engage in any form of production, importation, distribution, storage, and sale in commercial quantities without securing from the FPA a license therefor;\n\n(b) To use any pesticide or pesticide formulation on crops, livestock, and the environment in a manner contrary to good agricultural practices as hereinabove defined;\n\n(c) To deal in pesticides and/or fertilizers which have not been previously registered with FPA, or which registration has expired or has been suspended or revoked;\n\n(d) To adulterate pesticides formulation and fertilizer grade;\n\n(e) To impose as a condition for the purchase of fertilizer, the simultaneous purchase of pesticide for other agricultural chemical inputs and vice-versa;\n\n(f) To mislabel or make claims which differ in substance from the representation made in connection with a product's registration or from its actual effectiveness; and\n\n(g) To violate such other rules and regulations as may be promulgated by FPA.\n\nSection 9. Registration and Licensing. No pesticides, fertilizers, or other agricultural chemical shall be exported, imported, manufactured, formulated, stored, distributed, sold or offered for sale, transported, delivered for transportation or used unless it has been duly registered with the FPA or covered by a numbered provisional permit issued by FPA for use in accordance with the conditions as stipulated in the permit. Separate registrations shall be required for each active ingredient and its possible formulations in the case of pesticides or for each fertilizer grade in the case of fertilizer.\n\nNo person shall engage in the business of exporting, importing, manufacturing, formulating, distributing, supplying, repacking, storing, commercially applying, selling, marketing, of any pesticides, fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals except under a license issued by the FPA.\n\nThe FPA, in the pursuit of its duties and functions, may suspend, revoke, or modify the registration of any pesticide, fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals after due notice and hearing.\nAside from the use of the word \"pesticides\" always in conjunction with \"fertilizers\" or with the phrase \"fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals/chemical inputs\" or the phrase \"other agricultural chemicals,\" the italicized portions of P.D. No. 1144, as quoted above, buttress the interpretation that the law applies only to pesticide use for agricultural purposes.\n\nFurther, Section 1 of P.D. No. 1144 reads:\nSection 1. Creation of the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority . The Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority, hereinafter referred to as the FPA, is hereby created and attached to the Department of Agriculture for the purpose of assuring the agricultural sector of adequate supplies of fertilizer and pesticide at reasonable prices, rationalizing the manufacture and marketing of fertilizer, protecting the public from the risks inherent in the use of pesticides, and educating the agricultural sector in the use of these inputs.\nSignificantly, the above-quoted provision of P.D. No. 1144 sets the parameters of the powers and duties of the FPA.\u00a0 First, the FPA is designated as an attached agency of the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0 Urban pest control or pesticide use in households, offices, hotels and other commercial establishments has nothing to do with agriculture.\u00a0 Second, it spells out the purposes for which the FPA was created, viz: \"for the purpose of assuring the agricultural sector of adequate supplies of fertilizer and pesticide at reasonable prices, rationalizing the manufacture and marketing of fertilizer, protecting the public from the risks inherent in the use of pesticides, and educating the agricultural sector in the use of these inputs.\"\u00a0 All these purposes limit the jurisdiction of the FPA to agricultural pesticides.\n\nWe go back to the basics of statutory construction.\u00a0 In interpreting the meaning and scope of a term used in the law, a review of the whole law must be made, and its intendment must be given effect. [10] The various provisions of P.D. No. 1144 show its consistent intent to apply the term \"pesticides\" only to agricultural use.\u00a0 Thus, urban pest control operators and their urban pesticides are excluded from its coverage.\n\nFinally, we note that petitioner FPA, through House Bill No. 18740 filed in 1991, attempted to amend certain provisions of P.D. No. 1144 to expand its powers and functions by including urban pest control in its jurisdictional scope.\u00a0 Unfortunately for petitioner, House Bill No. 18740 did not pass.\u00a0 It was rejected by the bicameral committee. \u00a0The amendment would result in petitioner FPA's usurpation of other governmental agencies' authority.

FIL-ESTATE PROPERTIES, INC., AND COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAZCUNA, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for certiorari [1] seeking the nullification of the resolutions of the Court of Appeals, dated November 23, 2000 and May 8, 2001, dismissing a petition filed under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court due to procedural defects, [2] in CA-G.R. SP No. 60203 entitled, \"Paulino Reyes, et al. v. Fil-Estate Properties, Inc.\"\n\nCentral to the controversy is a portion of Hacienda Looc consisting of ten parcels of land with an aggregate area of 1,219.0133 hectares which was previously awarded to petitioners as evidenced by their Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs). At the instance of private respondent Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. (Fil-Estate), however, which sought the exclusion of the parcels of land from the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), the CLOAs were cancelled by the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD) on the ground that the lands were agriculturally undeveloped and had an average slope of more than 18%.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\nPetitioners are the tenants of the disputed portion of Hacienda Looc which has been the subject of application for exclusion from CARP coverage pursuant to Administrative Order No. 10, Series of 1994. [3]\n\nHacienda Looc is an 8,650-hectare property located in Nasugbu, Batangas registered under Transfer Certificate of\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Title (TCT) No. T-28719 of the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Batangas. It is comprised of four barangays, namely, Calayo, Looc, Papaya and Bulihan, and has a total population of more than 10,000.\n\nBy virtue of Presidential Decree No. 27 issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on October 21, 1972, a portion of the hacienda with an aggregate area of 1,282.9767 hectares that were planted with rice and corn were distributed to the farmers, and emancipation patents (EPs) were accordingly issued.\n\nThe hacienda was acquired by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) from the Magdalena Estate, Inc. through a Deed of Cession in Payment of Debt on May 19, 1971, and by a Deed of Assignment executed by the Philippine National Bank in favor of DBP on February 8, 1973.\n\nPursuant to Executive Order No. 14 issued on February 3, 1987 by President Corazon C. Aquino, certain assets and liabilities of DBP were transferred to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Among the properties that were transferred was Hacienda Looc.\n\nOn February 27, 1987, DBP executed a Deed of Transfer of the properties in favor of the government. On the same date, a Trust Agreement was entered into by the government and the Asset Privatization Trust (APT) whereby the latter was constituted trustee of Hacienda Looc.\n\nOn July 15, 1987, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), was enacted. Under the law, a Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) was to be undertaken by the government which shall cover, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity produced, all public and private agricultural lands as provided in the Constitution, including whenever applicable in accordance with law, other lands of the public domain suitable to agriculture.\n\nOn June 28, 1990, APT entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). Under the agreement, APT signified its intention to sell to DAR portions of the hacienda under the Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS) scheme of R.A. No. 6657 on the condition that DAR will return to APT non-CARPable portions of the property.\n\nAPT ceded possession and control of the entire property to DAR for the latter to undertake a field verification and coverage of the CARPable areas of the hacienda.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1993, DAR generated 25 Certificates of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs) to the farmers of the hacienda.\n\nOn December 10, 1993, APT conducted a public bidding involving the property in question. Bellevue Properties, Inc. tendered the highest cash bid. It thereafter assigned the right to purchase the property to Manila Southcoast Development Corporation (MSDC), subrogating to the latter all its rights, claims and\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0benefits under the DAR-APT memorandum of agreement.\n\nOn March 7, 1995, MSDC filed an adverse claim over Hacienda Looc before the Register of Deeds of Nasugbu, Batangas. In the same year, MSDC was able to register the disputed ten parcels of land of the hacienda with an aggregate area of 1,219.0133 hectares. These are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nTCT No. | Lot No. | Area (has.) | R.O.\n\n72098 | 780-5 | 117.2230 | MSDC\n72099 | 780-6 | 50.6760 | MSDC\n73000 | 780-11 | 135.2297 | MSDC\n73002 | 780-13 | 79.4639 | MSDC\n73003 | 780-14 | 113.0728 | MSDC\n73004 | 780-15 | 30.6594 | MSDC\n73005 | 780-32 | 58.0232 | MSDC\n3006 | 780-19 | 266.8548 | MSDC\n73007 | 780-16 | 234.3264 | MSDC\n | TOTAL | 1,219.0133 | \n[END_TABLE]\n\nTCT No. Lot No. Area (has.)

On May 17, 1995, MSDC filed an amended petition before the PARAD with the same content and relief.\n\nOn May 30, 1995, Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator Antonio Cabili issued an Order stopping all joint venture agreements in Hacienda Looc. Due to a Motion for Inhibition filed by one of the\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0lawyers involved in the case, however, Cabili inhibited himself from the proceedings and elevated the case to the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (RARAD) under Adjudicator Fe Arche-Manalang on June 28, 1995. [4]\n\nOn October 17, 1995, MSDC, Carmona Realty and private respondent executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to enable MSDC and private respondent to have a joint venture agreement relative to the development of Hacienda Looc into a mixed-use residential, commercial, resort, leisure and recreational complex. Likewise, under the agreement, MSDC and private respondent shall immediately develop about 1,269 hectares of the hacienda, comprised largely of the afore-mentioned ten parcels of land.\n\nBetween the months of January and June of 1996, the DAR Regional Adjudicator issued three Partial Summary Judgments canceling the fifteen (15) CLOAs issued to the farmers, including those covering the ten parcels of land. The cancellation was grounded on the waiver allegedly executed by the farmer-beneficiaries who declared that the lands they were tilling were not suitable for agriculture.\n\nOn October 4, 1996, private respondent, by virtue of a Joint Venture Agreement with MSDC for the purpose of developing the area covered by the ten cancelled CLOAs, filed a Petition for Exclusion [5] of the subject lots from CARP coverage on the ground that they had an average slope of more than eighteen percent (18%), and the area \"has no semblance of agricultural development whatsoever.\" [6]\n\nMeanwhile, petitioners, along with the other farmer-beneficiaries affected by the order, filed a complaint with the Office of the DAR Secretary objecting to the cancellation of their respective CLOAs. According to them, even before MSDC and private respondent Fil-Estate entered into such an agreement, heavily armed security guards brought several bulldozers and large equipment into the hacienda, and soon launched a massive operation for the leveling of the area and the eviction of the farmers. Petitioners added that: they were never informed of the proceedings concerning the cancellation of the CLOAs or of the application by respondent for the exemption of the subject lots from CARP; MSDC introduced as evidence fraudulently acquired and perjured documents such as the supposed sworn statements of deceased CLOA holders;\u00a0 MSDC threatened and intimidated the farmers to sign blank waivers and declarations of abandonment of the area purportedly because the land is non-agricultural in nature; and, the DAR lawyers appointed to protect the rights and interests of the affected farmers colluded with MSDC. [7]\n\nOn October 16, 1996, the DAR Secretary directed Undersecretary for Field Operations Hector D. Soliman to conduct an investigation regarding the cancellation of the CLOAs that were previously issued to the farmers of Hacienda Looc, as well as the development/conversion activities undertaken by private respondent in the areas concerned.\n\nPublic hearings were respectively conducted, and on December 18, 1996, Undersecretary Soliman submitted his fact-finding report [8] with the following recommendations:\nImmediately issue a cease and desist order that will temporarily\u00a0 stop the development of the area, considering that there is still a pending application for exemption of the property, and the determination of the coverage of the property has not been finally acted upon by the Secretary;\n\nImmediately designate a substitute lawyer who will defend the interests and concerns of the public respondent DAR, [and] the integrity of the CLOAs, to the extent of the 1,152 hectares identified by the LBP and the Task Force Hacienda Looc as suitable for agriculture;\n\nConstitute an investigating panel to be headed by Director George Lucero as Resident Ombudsman, to look into the alleged falsification of the signature of Maximino de Joya, and others similarly situated, who was supposed to have been deceased, at the time of the signature of the waiver, and to recommend the prosecution of erring personnel of government, including the DAR, if any there be;\n\nDirect the Regional Office to conduct a massive information campaign in the area, regarding the following:\nThe extend of the sale between APT and the MDSC;\nThe status of the ongoing case between MSDC and the farmers;\nThe rights and responsibilities of the EP holders who are not covered by the case under litigation; and\nSuch other information that will fully apprise the farmers of their rights and responsibilities under agrarian law.\nIntervene in the ECC process being undertaken by the DENR by preparing the following interventions:\nWith respect to the areas which are still pending consideration by the DARAB, to request that the issuance of the ECC be suspended until such time that matters which are still under litigation are finally resolved; and\nWith respect to the areas which are above 18% slope and undeveloped, to manifest officially with the DENR that such areas, although exempted from\u00a0 CARP, should be preserved for reforestation purposes, in order not to aggravate soil erosion and jeopardize the lowland agricultural activities.\nUrge the DOT to convene a multi-agency, multi-sectoral review committee that will review the development plan of Fil-Estate and determine whether it conforms to the projected tourism master plan for the area, if any, and whether it conforms to agrarian and environmental laws. Such review committee should be lodged with the appropriate Cabinet Cluster.\nOn the basis of the fact-finding report of Undersecretary Soliman, the DAR Secretary issued memoranda [9] on December 18, 1996, adopting item Nos. 2, 3 and 4 of the report.\n\nMeanwhile, on December 26, 1996, the DAR Regional Director for Region IV issued an Order granting the Petition for Exclusion filed by Fil-Estate pursuant to Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 10, Series of 1994. As a result, the subject ten parcels of land with an aggregate area of 1,219.0133 hectares were exempted from CARP coverage.\n\nOn January 29, 1997, petitioners, aggrieved by the Order of Exclusion, filed their appeal with the Office of the DAR Secretary. They assailed the aforementioned order on the grounds that 1) there was no due process as they were not informed of the exemption case or the proceedings thereof; 2) the cancellation of the CLOAs was based on the waivers allegedly executed by the farmer-beneficiaries; and 3) the property was agriculturally developed and, therefore, covered by CARP.\n\nIn view of the appeal, the Office of the DAR Secretary organized a team composed of DAR and LBP officials to perform the following: 1) segregate the contested area from the rest of the hacienda through boundary surveys; 2) determine, from the slope maps, the slope of the contested areas; 3) conduct a lot by lot determination of the areas to be placed under CARP by identifying and segregating the agriculturally developed areas, if any; 4) receive evidence to be presented by the protesting farmers and other farmers interested in the case; and 5) submit its reports on the contested lots. [10]\n\nOn March 25, 1998, the DAR Secretary issued an Order, the pertinent portion of which reads:\nThe Team, after making its findings, had also ... recommended the coverage of the developed areas and the exclusion of the undeveloped areas. x x x\n\nOn 31 December 1997, Undersecretary Bulatao, Chairperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force, submitted his recommendation, hereunder quoted x x x:\n\nx x x\n\n\"The main implications of these recommendations are as follow:\nfarmers issued Emancipation Patents (EPs) over some 1,197 hectares of rice land maintain their ownership of these lands;\n\nfarmers who cultivated portions of the other areas covered by CLOAs before and up to the time the CLOAs were supposedly cancelled will have their lands covered under compulsory acquisition, subject to the three-hectare ceiling for beneficiaries and appropriate valuation and payment procedures;\n\nManila Southcoast Development Corporation will now have a clean title to the rest of the land and can proceed with its development directly or indirectly and will be compensated for the hectarage removed from its title due to coverage under RA No. 6657.\" It is also worthwhile to note that in all the proceedings, the affected beneficiaries were given more than sufficient opportunity to present their claims. In addition, this case has taken too long to resolve because of the different motions and petitions by all parties.\n\nWHEREFORE, given these different recommendations of four different Committees and Task Forces, this Order is hereby issued as follows:\nCoverage of the following agriculturally developed areas, re-documentation of the same under CARP acquisition and awarded to individual beneficiaries found to be qualified under the CARL: Lot No. 5: 2.3029 hectares as farmlots and 0.0666 as homelots, the homelots to be awarded to actual occupants thereof. Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nLot No. 6: 12.8467 hectare farmlot. Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nLot. No. 11: 1,1234 hectares farmlot and 0.6388 homelots to be awarded to actual occupants therof. Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nLot No. 12: 13.894 hectares as farmlots. Some 2.3674 has. and .4586 has. were deducted from the claim of Mr. Jaime Sobremonte and Mr. Leonardo Caronilla, respectively, as these already exceed the three hectares award ceiling. The area has been scraped by previous bulldozing by the applicant such that it becomes impossible for the team to determine the actual agricultural development of the area. In view of the situation, the Task Force deemed it proper to award the land to the claimants as the presumption must tilt in their favor, there being no contrary evidence presented by the applicant.\u00a0 The award shall not exceed three hectares per claimant UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nLot No. 13: 0.2251 hectare farmlot. Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\nLot No. 15: 76.376 hectares as farmlot. However, the coverage of the areas identified as fishponds shall be suspended until the Courts resolve the constitutionality of the law exempting fishponds from the coverage of agrarian reform.\u00a0 Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS\u00a0 there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nLot No. 16:\u00a0 14.2026 hectares as farmlots.\u00a0 Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nLot No. 19:\u00a0 16.5695 hectares as farmlots.\u00a0 Priority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS there is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in the claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of agricultural land;\n\nApproval of the distribution of homelots in Lots No. 9 and 20.\u00a0 As\nmanifested, the total area of 65.38 hectares shall be distributed\nprimarily as homelots to actual occupants.\u00a0 The area within Lot 20\nwhich is agriculturally developed shall be subjected to further\nverification as to its CARPability and the same shall also be awarded\nas farmlots, covered by Certificates of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAS).\u00a0\nPriority for the award of the farmlot will be the claimant, UNLESS\nthere is reason to disqualify him and said award shall not result in\nthe claimant becoming an owner of more than three (3) hectares of\nagricultural land.\nMaintaining the coverage of some 1,197 hectares, more or less, of lands under Operation Land Transfer and conducting survey of the actual tillers of the land for purposes of awarding the same /re-allocating the same to its actual tillers in accordance with the land to the tiller principle.\n\nOn the Matter of Environmental Protection. In areas that will be exempted by virtue of Section 10, of RA 6657, any development thereon, should be consistent with the intent of the law to preserve these lands for forest cover and soil conservation. It is therefore recommended that the DENR study the development of the area with this end in view in its issuance of ECCs.\n\nParticularly, it is recommended that a buffer zone be established by the DENR to ensure protection of OLT and CARP lands from damage or erosion, as a result of any development to be implemented in excluded areas;\n\nRe-conveyance of the exempt parcels to the Asset Privatization Trust, or its successors-in-interest, after the CLOAs are properly cancelled by the proper forum;\n\nNullifying the alleged sale or transfer of rights over the CLOAs as contrary to the provisions of agrarian law; and\n\nDirecting the Regional Director to post a copy of this Order, including the maps attached hereto in the barangay halls of Brgys. Calayo and Papaya to afford all parties the opportunity to be notified and to cause the amendments of CLOAs issued.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11]\nPetitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied by the DAR Secretary in an order dated June 15, 1998.\n\nOn June 29, 1998, petitioners appealed the Orders of the DAR Secretary to the Office of the President (OP).\n\nOn July 5, 2000, the OP, through Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, issued a decision dismissing the appeal, and affirming the challenged orders of the DAR. Thus:\nAt the outset, four (4) premises need to be underscored:\n\nFirst, while FEPI does not wholly agree with the appealed orders of the DAR, it chose to assail the same before the Court of Appeals via a petition for partial review. Hence, insofar as this Office is concerned, FEPI is theoretically presumed to be satisfied with the adjudication made by the DAR Secretary (AG&P v. Court of Appeals, 247 SCRA 606). The entrenched rule is that a party who has not himself appealed cannot secure from the appellate court/body any affirmative relief other than those granted him in the decision of the court/body below (Carrion v. CA, 260 SCRA 682).\n\nSecond , the cancellation of the ten (10) CLOAs, i.e., CLOA Nos. 4152, 4253, 4157, 4158,\u00a0 4159,\u00a0 4474,\u00a0 4475,\u00a0 4476,\u00a0 4478\u00a0 and 6662, is, as the DAR declared, strictly not an issue here, the cancellation having been effected by the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD), per his decision in DARAB Case No. IV Ba - 3468, dated January 8, 1986. This decision is beyond the reviewing authority of this Office for, apart from its having become final and executory, such decision is appealable to the DAR Adjudication Board whose decision in turn is appealable to the Court of Appeals (DARAB v. CA, 266 SCRA 176; Machete v. CA, 250 SCRA 176).\n\nThird, only a portion of Hacienda Looc - the exclusion of which from CARP coverage FEPI sought - was originally involved in this case. In absolute terms, only the 1,219.09-hectare portion of the hacienda, corresponding to the ten (10) lots that the CLOAs cover but which had been cancelled, was the subject of the basic petition of FEPI for exclusion, albeit the appealed orders cover areas not contemplated in the underlying petition for exclusion.\n\nFourth, the appealed orders, by excluding/exempting from CARP coverage pursuant to Section 10 of R.A. No. 6657, the contested ten (10) lots, save for some 69.50 hectares found to be agriculturally developed, hence to be covered under CARP, virtually affirmed with modification the order of Regional Director Remigio Tabones, dated December 26, 1996...\n\nIn all, this Office finds, as did the DAR Secretary and, before him, the Regional Director, DAR Region IV, the exclusion from CARP coverage of the ten (10) lots subject of FEPI's petition for exclusion to be proper...\n\nWith the foregoing disquisitions, this Office deems it unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised by appellants, e.g. ,\u00a0 the validity of the contract of sale entered into by and between the APT and MSDC concerning Hacienda LOOC, the effectivity of Proclamation Nos. 1520 and 1801, and the applicability of DOJ Opinion No. 44, s. of 1990, touching as they do on what the DAR described as \"collateral matters\" which have no decisive bearing in the resolution of this case...\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby Dismissed. The appealed DAR orders, Dated March 25, 1998 and June 15, 1998 are accordingly Affirmed.\n\nSO ORDERED. [12]\nPetitioners filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals (CA) assailing the decision of the Executive Secretary.\u00a0 The CA, in its resolution, dated September 4, 2000, denied the petition thus:\nx x x\n\nContrary to Sec. 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure, the verification and certification of non-forum shopping was signed by only one (Guillermo Bautista) of the petitioners.\n\nMoreover, in violation of Sec. 13, Rule 13 and Sec. 6(c) Rule 43, the petition contains no affidavit of service while the assailed decision, material portions of the record and other supporting papers are merely photocopies.\n\nWHEREFORE, for being insufficient in form and substance, the petition is DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\nPetitioners' motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by the CA in its resolution dated May 8, 2001:\n... In her Affidavit (Annex \"A\", Motion), Ms. Maria Victoria Lirio, secretary of petitioners' counsel, explained that she failed to attach to the petition the Special Power of Attorney (Annex \"B\", id. ) executed by the other petitioners in favor of Guillermo Bautista empowering the latter to represent them in the instant petition. However, the Special Power of Attorney was acknowledged by only 10 out of the 45 petitioners. Consequently, the certificate of non-forum shopping is still defective.\n\nMoreover, petitioners did not correct the defects of the petition, i.e., absence of the affidavit of service and non-submission of certified true copies of the assailed decision and other papers.\n\nApropos is the Supreme Court's ruling that \"(h)aving failed to observe very elementary rules of procedure which are mandatory, petitioner caused her own predicament and to exculpate her from the compulsory coverage of such rules is to undermine the stability of the judicial process, as the bench and bar will be confounded by such irritating uncertainties as when to obey and when to ignore the rules.\" (Tan v. Court of Appeals, 295 SCRA 755)\n\nWHEREFORE, for lack of merit, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED.\n\nSO ORDERED [14]\nHence, this petition raising these issues:\nWhether the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition for review filed under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, notwithstanding the fact that it would result to manifest injustice; [15] and\n\nWhether the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the substantial rights of the petitioners. [16]\nPetitioners argue as follows:\n\nFirst, the cancellation of the ten Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) is an issue that has to be resolved because the farmers were not accorded due process. The proceedings for the exemption of the property from CARP coverage, and the cancellation of the CLOAs were improvidently done without the knowledge and participation of the affected farmers.\n\nSecond, the signatures in the waivers allegedly executed by the farmers who declared that the lands they were tilling were not agriculturally viable and developed were forged as the latter had been dead at the time the waivers were supposedly executed;\n\nThird, the segregation of a portion of the hacienda which involves 1,219 hectares that private respondent applied for exemption from CARP coverage for conversion to non-agricultural use such as a golf course, will adversely affect the entire ecological balance and social order of the hacienda;\n\nFourth, the hacienda is agricultural in character, therefore, covered by CARP. It is suitable for agriculture, that is, developed and productive, and the fact that only patches or certain portions of the disputed lots are actually planted with crops does not make them non-agricutural;\n\nFifth, in the fact-finding report, DAR Undersecretary Soliman stated that the question as to whether the area is excluded from CARP coverage because it had been reclassified as a tourism area has not been resolved yet by the DAR Secretary, who, under Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 1994, is mandated to issue certificates of exemption under DOJ Opinion No. 44. In addition, tourist zones are not included among the categories of lands which are exempted under Section 3(c) of R.A. No. 6657. Finally, the area to be excluded has not been sufficiently delineated in order to make the exemption realistic and implementable at an operational level, unlike other municipal ordinances which are accompanied by specific land use maps of adequate scale and size;\n\nSixth, with respect to petitioners' non-compliance with Sec. 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure on verification and certification of non-forum shopping as a ground cited by the CA for the dismissal of the petition, petitioners aver that the Special Power of Attorney (SPA) of Guillermo Bautista which they had executed way before constituting him as their attorney-in-fact was not attached to the petition due to the inadvertence of their counsel's secretary;\n\nSeventh, on the point that petitioners violated Sec. 13, Rule 13 and Sec. 6(c), Rule 43, petitioners state that copies of the petition to the Court of Appeals were actually furnished to the DAR Secretary, the DAR Regional Director and the adverse counsel via personal service as shown by their respective signatures on the last page of the petition attesting to the receipt thereof; and,\n\nFinally, petitioners insist that they should be given a fair chance to present the merits of their case because technicalities must not be used to stay the hands of justice and frustrate the novel objectives of the agrarian law.\n\nClearly, a resolution of the case rests upon a determination of whether the disputed ten parcels of land are exempt from CARP coverage.\n\nIn relation to the instant petition, Section 10 of R.A. No 6657 states that \"all lands with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already developed shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.\"\n\nOne of the reasons why petitioners are objecting to the cancellation of their CLOAs and the exclusion of the ten parcels of land from CARP coverage is because these lots are agricultural and developed. While it is true that the DAR officials have generally found the lots to have an average slope of 18%, the contention that the same have been cultivated and are actually agriculturally developed so as to make them subject to CARP is a factual matter that must be looked into.\u00a0 As indicated by Undersecretary Soliman in his fact-finding report:\n... [A]s a general rule, lands which are above 18% slope are exempt from CARP, but their land use should be compatible with the underlying basis for exemption, meaning reforestation and soil conservation. Therefore, as a general rule also, these areas should not be converted to uses other than agro-forestry, reforestation, or other environmentally sustainable uses. Otherwise, the very purpose of their exemption from CARP (and their shifting to the DENR's reforestation and soil conservation program) would be circumvented all the more.\n\nHaving clearly stated the position, we now come to the discussion of the 1,152 hectares more or less of developed areas within the 25 titles. It could be generally conceded that the areas which are subject of the 25 CLOA titles are sloping areas, and are above 18% in slope. However, under Sec. 10 of RA 6657, if the area is developed, then they could still be covered by CARP. It is also a fact that the Task Force Hacienda Looc ... did not recommend the cancellation of all the titles, but only 2,829 hectares, contending that some 1,152 hectares are developed and therefore could be covered by CARP. Moreover, this recommendation has been approved by then Regional Director, Percival Dalugdug.\n\nA quick perusal of the records reveals that this very outstanding fact that some 1,152 hectares of land which are spread out over 25 titles under CLOA, was in fact recommended to be covered under CARP but somehow, this fact was lost in the process. What was primarily relied upon by the adjudicator was the waivers signed by the farmers who declared that the land they are tilling is not suitable for agriculture.\n\nWe beg to disagree with the waivers signed by the farmers in this particular case, considering their uniform phraseology and format. They have obviously been prepared y persons who are interested in having the titles cancelled, and the farmers have been merely asked to sign the same. The primordial authority of the DAR, that of making an administrative determination of whether the land is suitable for agriculture or not, has been supplanted in this case by a determination of the farmers whether the land is suitable or not for agriculture... [17]\nBased on the foregoing, and upon a review of the records, the Court agrees with petitioners that there are factual matters that should be re-examined to properly resolve this case. \u00a0This Court is not a trier of facts.\u00a0 The CA, having the appellate jurisdiction to rule on the controversy, must re-evaluate the factual aspects of the case in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice.\n\nWhile, generally, petitioners' failure to comply with the procedural requirements prescribed under the Rules of Court would warrant the dismissal of the petition, [18] fundamental considerations of substantial justice persuade the Court to have the present case decided on the merits rather than dismissed on a technicality. [19] It is settled that the rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very strict and technical sense. These are used only to help secure rather than override substantial justice. \u00a0The stringent application of the rules must yield to the demands of substantial justice. [20]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED . The Resolutions of the Court of Appeals, dated November 23, 2000 and May 8, 2001, in CA-G.R. SP No. 60203 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is hereby REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for it to render a decision on the merits with DISPATCH, giving this Court a report on the progress thereon every three months.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[2] The petition was dismissed for: 1) failure of all of the petitioners to sign the verification and certificate of non-forum shopping; 2) the absence of affidavit of service; and 3) non-submission of certified true copies of the assailed decision and other supporting papers.\n\n[3] The administrative order provides the rules and procedures governing the exemption of lands from CARP coverage.\n\n[4] Rollo, p. 25.\n\n[5] Rollo, p. 437.\n\n[6] Id. at 86.\n\n[7] Id. at\u00a0 27.\n\n[8] Id. at\u00a0 381.\n\n[9] Annexes \"K,\" \"K-1\" and \"K-2\" of\u00a0 Petition (Rollo, pp. 397-398).\n\n[10] Emphasis supplied; Rollo, p. 74.\n\n[11] Rollo, pp. 91-94.\n\n[12] Id. at\u00a0 81-84; emphasis supplied.\n\n[13] Id. at\u00a0 98.\n\n[14] Id . at\u00a0 100.\n\n[15] Id . at 42.\n\n[16] Id. at\u00a0 63.\n\n[17] Id . at 390.\n\n[18] Gonzalo D.

COURT OF APPEALS, PEOPLEOF THE PHILIPPINES, CALTEX PHILIPPINES, INC., PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BANK (PCIBANK), RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nEDUARDO G. RICARZE, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, PEOPLEOF THE PHILIPPINES, CALTEX PHILIPPINES, INC., PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BANK (PCIBANK), RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a petition for review on certiorari of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 68492, and its Resolution [2] which denied the Motion for Reconsideration and the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration thereof.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nPetitioner Eduardo G. Ricarze was employed as a collector-messenger by City Service Corporation, a domestic corporation engaged in messengerial services. He was assigned to the main office of Caltex Philippines, Inc. (Caltex) in Makati City. His primary task was to collect checks payable to Caltex and deliver them to the cashier. He also delivered invoices to Caltex's customers. [3]\n\nOn November 6, 1997, Caltex, through its Banking and Insurance Department Manager Ramon Romano, filed a criminal complaint against petitioner before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati City for estafa through falsification of commercial documents. Romano alleged that, on October 16, 1997, while his department was conducting a daily electronic report from Philippine Commercial & Industrial Bank (PCIB) Dela Rosa, Makati Branch, one of its depositary banks, it was discovered that unknown to the department, a company check, Check No. 74001 dated October 13, 1997 in the amount of P5,790,570.25 payable to Dante R. Gutierrez, had been cleared through PCIB on October 15, 1997. An investigation also revealed that two other checks (Check Nos. 73999 and 74000) were also missing and that in Check No. 74001, his signature and that of another signatory, Victor S. Goquinco, were forgeries. Another check, Check No. 72922 dated September 15, 1997 in the amount of P1,790,757.25 likewise payable to Dante R. Gutierrez, was also cleared through the same bank on September 24, 1997; this check was likewise not issued by Caltex, and the signatures appearing thereon had also been forged. Upon verification, it was uncovered that Check Nos. 74001 and 72922 were deposited at the Banco de Oro's SM Makati Branch under Savings Account No. S/A 2004-0047245-7, in the name of a regular customer of Caltex, Dante R. Gutierrez.\n\nGutierrez, however, disowned the savings account as well as his signatures on the dorsal portions thereof. He also denied having withdrawn any amount from said savings account. Further investigation revealed that said savings account had actually been opened by petitioner; the forged checks were deposited and endorsed by him under Gutierrez's name. A bank teller from the Banco de Oro, Winnie P. Donable Dela Cruz, positively identified petitioner as the person who opened the savings account using Gutierrez's name. [4]\n\nIn the meantime, the PCIB credited the amount of P581,229.00 to Caltex on March 29, 1998.\u00a0 However, the City Prosecutor of Makati City was not informed of this development. After the requisite preliminary investigation, the City Prosecutor filed two (2) Informations for estafa through falsification of commercial documents on June 29, 1998 against petitioner before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 63. The Informations are worded as follows:\nCriminal Case No. 98-1611\n\nThat on or about the 24 th day of September 1997 in the City of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a private individual, with intent to defraud\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0and intent to gain, without the knowledge and consent \u00a0\u00a0of Caltex Philippines, Inc. through its duly authorized officers/representatives, and by means of falsification of commercial document, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud Caltex Phils., Inc., in the following manner, to wit: said accused, having obtained possession of PCIBank check no. 72922 dated September 15, 1997 payable to Dante R. Gutierrez, in the amount of Php1,790,757.50 with intent to defraud or cause damage to complainant Caltex Phils., Inc., willfully, unlawfully and feloniously affixed or caused to be affixed signatures purporting to be those of Ramon Romano and Victor Goquingco, Caltex authorized officers/signatories, and of payee Dante R. Gutierrez, causing it to appear that Ramon Romano and Victor Goquingco have participated in the issuance of PCIBank check no. 72922 and that Dante R. Gutierrez had endorsed it, when in truth and in fact, as said accused well knew, such was not the case, since said check previously stolen from Payables Section of CALTEX, was neither duly signed by Ramon Romano and Victor Goquingco nor endorsed by Dante R. Gutierrez, after the check, a commercial document, was falsified in the manner above set forth, the said accused purporting himself to be the payee, Dante R. Gutierrez, deposited the check with Banco De Oro under Account No. 2004-0047245-7, thereby appropriating the proceeds of the falsified but cleared check, to the damage and prejudice of complainant herein represented by Ramon Romano, in the amount of Php1,790,757.50.\n\nCriminal Case No. 98-1612\n\nThat on or about the 15 th day of October 1997 in the City of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a private individual, with intent to defraud and intent to gain, without the knowledge and consent of Caltex Philippines, Inc. through its duly authorized officers/representatives, and by means of falsification of commercial document, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud Caltex Phils., Inc., in the following manner, to wit: said accused, having obtained possession of PCIBank check no. 74001 dated October 13, 1997 payable to Dante R. Gutierrez, in the amount of Php5,790,570.25 with intent to defraud or cause damage to complainant Caltex Phils., Inc., willfully, unlawfully and feloniously affixed or caused to be affixed signatures purporting to be those of Ramon Romano and Victor Goquingco, Caltex authorized officers/signatories, and of payee Dante R. Gutierrez, causing it to appear that Ramon Romano and Victor Goquingco have participated in the issuance of PCIBank check no. 74001 and that Dante R. Gutierrez had endorsed it, when in truth and in fact, as said accused well knew, such was not the case, since said check previously stolen from Payables Section of CALTEX, was neither duly signed by Ramon Romano and Victor Goquingco nor endorsed by Dante R. Gutierrez, after the check, a commercial document, was falsified in the manner above set forth, the said accused purporting himself to be the payee, Dante R. Gutierrez, deposited the check with Banco De Oro under Account No. 2004-0047245-7, thereby appropriating the proceeds of the falsified but cleared check, to the damage and prejudice of complainant herein represented by Ramon Romano, in the amount of Php5,790,570.25. [5]\nPetitioner was arraigned on August 18, 1998, and pleaded not guilty to both charges. [6] Pre-trial ensued and the cases were jointly tried. The prosecution presented its witnesses, after which the Siguion Reyna, Montecillio and Ongsiako Law Offices (SRMO) as private prosecutor filed a Formal Offer of Evidence. [7] Petitioner opposed the pleading, contending that the private complainant was represented by the ACCRA Law Offices and the Balgos and Perez Law Office during trial, and it was only after the prosecution had rested its case that SRMO entered its appearance as private prosecutor representing the PCIB. Since the ACCRA and Balgos and Perez Law Offices had not withdrawn their appearance, SRMO had no personality to appear as private prosecutor. Under the Informations, the private complainant is Caltex and not PCIB; hence, the Formal Offer of Evidence filed by SRMO should be stricken from the records.\n\nPetitioner further averred that unless the Informations were amended to change the private complainant to PCIB, his right as accused would be prejudiced. He pointed out, however, that the Informations can no longer be amended because he had already been arraigned under the original Informations. [8] He insisted that the amendments of the Informations to substitute PCIB as the offended party for Caltex would place him in double jeopardy.\n\nPCIB, through SRMO, opposed the motion. It contended that the PCIB had re-credited the amount to Caltex to the extent of the indemnity; hence, the PCIB had been subrogated to the rights and interests of Caltex as private complainant. Consequently, the PCIB is entitled to receive any civil indemnity which the trial court would adjudge against the accused. Moreover, the re-credited amount was brought out on cross-examination by Ramon Romano who testified for the Prosecution. PCIB pointed out that petitioner had marked in evidence the letter of the ACCRA Law Office to PCIBank dated October 10, 1997 and the credit memo sent by PCIB to Caltex. [9]\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion to Expunge the Opposition of SRMO. [10] In his Rejoinder, he averred that the substitution of PCIB as private complainant cannot be made by mere oral motion; the Information must be amended to allege that the private complainant was PCIB and not Caltex after the preliminary investigation of the appropriate complaint of PCIB before the Makati City Prosecutor.\n\nIn response, the PCIB, through SRMO, averred that as provided in Section 2, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, the erroneous designation of the name of the offended party is a mere formal defect which can be cured by inserting the name of the offended party in the Information. To support its claim, PCIB cited the ruling of this Court in Sayson v. People. [11]\n\nOn July 18, 2001, the RTC issued an Order granting the motion of the private prosecutor for the substitution of PCIB as private complainant for Caltex.\u00a0 It however denied petitioner's motion to have the formal offer of evidence of SRMO expunged from the record. [12] Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which the RTC denied on November 14, 2001. [13]\n\nPetitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with Urgent Application for Temporary Restraining Order with the Court of Appeals (CA,) praying for the annulment of the RTC's Orders of July 18, 2001 and November 14, 2001.\u00a0 The petitioner averred that:\nI\nRESPONDENT JUDGE GRIEVEOUSLY (SIC) ERRED IN RENDERING ITS ORDER ISSUED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION TANTAMOUNT TO LACK OF OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION BY ALLOWING THE SUBSTITUTION OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT, AFTER THE ACUSED WAS ALREADY ARRAIGNED AND PROSECUTION HAS ALREADY TERMINATED PRESENTING ITS EVIDENCE THEREBY PATENTLY VIOLATING THE STRICT CONDITION IMPOSED UPON BY RULE 110 SEC. 14 RULES ON CRIMINAL ROCEDURE.\n\nII\nAND AS A COROLLARY GROUND RESPONDENT JUDGE COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN RENDERING AN ORDER RECOGNIZING THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW PROSECUTOR WITHOUT WRITTEN OR EVEN ORAL WITHDRAWAL OF THE COUNSEL ON RECORD. [14]\nAccording to petitioner, damage or injury to the offended party is an essential element of estafa. The amendment of the Informations substituting the PCIBank for Caltex as the offended party would prejudice his rights since he is deprived of a defense available before the amendment, and which would be unavailable if the Informations are amended. Petitioner further insisted that the ruling in the Sayson case did not apply to this case.\n\nOn November 5, 2002, the appellate court rendered judgment dismissing the petition. The fallo reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition to annul the orders dated July 18, 2001 and November 14, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 63, Makati City in Criminal Case Nos. 98-1611 and 98-1612 is hereby DENIED and consequently DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15]\nThe appellate court declared that when PCIB restored the amount of the checks to Caltex, it was subrogated to the latter's right against petitioner. It further declared that in offenses against property, the designation of the name of the offended party is not absolutely indispensable for as long as the criminal act charged in the complaint or information can be properly identified. The appellate court cited the rulings of this Court in People v. Ho [16] and People v. Reyes. [17]\n\nOn October 17, 2003, the CA issued a Resolution denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration. [18]\n\nHence, petitioner filed the instant petition which is anchored on the following grounds:\nTHE PEOPLE V. YU CHAI HO 53 PHILIPPINES 874 IS INAPPLICABLE TO THE CASE AT BAR CONSIDERING THE PACTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.\n\nLIKEWISE, THE CASE OF PEOPLE VS. REYES CA, 50 (2) OG 665, NOVEMBER 11, 1953 HAS NO MATERIAL BEARING TO THE PRESENT CASE.\n\nTHE SUBSTITUTION OF PCIBANK WILL SUBSTANTIALLY PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS OF THE PETITIONER HENCE, IT IS PROHIBITED BY SEC. 14 OF RULE 110.\n\nTHERE IS NO VALID SUBROGATION BETWEEN CALTEX AND PCIBANK. ASSUMING THERE IS, THE CIVIL CASE SHOULD BE DISMISSED TO PROSECUTE.\n\nTHE TWIN INFORMATIONS UPON WHICH PETITIONER WAS INDICTED, ARRAIGNED, PRE-TRIAL HELD AND PUBLIC PROSECUTOR TERMINATED THE PRESENTATION OF ITS EVIDENCE IN CHIEF ARE DEFECTIVE AND VOID, HENCE THE DISMISSAL IS IN ORDER.\n\nPETITIONER TIMELY OBJECTED TO THE APPEARANCE OF PRIVATE PROSECUTOR FOR PCIBANK.\n\nTHE FINDINGS OF MATERIAL FACTS ARE NOT SUPORTED BY THE RECORD NOR EVIDENCE AND BASED ON MISAPPRECIATION OF FACTS.\n\nPETITIONER'S SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DID NOT VIOLATE THE OMNIBUS MOTION RULE UNDER SEC. 8, RULE 15 OF THE 1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. [19]\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nPetitioner argues that the substitution of Caltex by PCIB as private complainant at this late stage of the trial is prejudicial to his defense. He argues that the substitution is tantamount to a substantial amendment of the Informations which is prohibited under Section 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court.\n\nUnder Section 5, Rule 110 [20] of the Revised Rules of Rules, all criminal actions covered by a complaint or information shall be prosecuted under the direct supervision and control of the public prosecutor.\u00a0 Thus, even if the felonies or delictual acts of the accused result in damage or injury to another, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability based on the said criminal acts is impliedly instituted, and the offended party has not waived the civil action, reserved the right to institute it separately or instituted the civil action prior to the criminal action, the prosecution of the action (including the civil) remains under the control and supervision of the public prosecutor. The prosecution of offenses is a public function. Under Section 16, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the offended party may intervene in the criminal action personally or by counsel, who will act as private prosecutor for the protection of his interests and in the interest of the speedy and inexpensive administration of justice.\u00a0 A separate action for the purpose would only prove to be costly, burdensome and time-consuming for both parties and further delay the final disposition of the case.\u00a0 The multiplicity of suits must be avoided. With the implied institution of the civil action in the criminal action, the two actions are merged into one composite proceeding, with the criminal action predominating the civil. The prime purpose of the criminal action is to punish the offender in order to deter him and others from committing the same or similar offense, to isolate him from society, reform and rehabilitate him or, in general, to maintain social order. [21]\n\nOn the other hand, the sole purpose of the civil action is for the resolution, reparation or indemnification of the private offended party for the damage or injury he sustained by reason of the delictual or felonious act of the accused. [22] Under Article 104 of the Revised Penal Code, the following are the civil liabilities of the accused:\nART. 104. What is included in civil liability. - The civil liability established in Articles 100, 101, 102 and 103 of this Code includes:\nRestitution; Reparation of the damage caused; Indemnification for consequential damages.\nOn the other hand, Section 14, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure states:\nSection 14. Amendment or substitution. - A complaint or information may be amended, in form or in substance, without leave of court, at any time before the accused enters his plea. After the plea and during the trial, a formal amendment may only be made with leave of court and when it can be done without causing prejudice to the rights of the accused.\n\nHowever, any amendment before plea, which downgrades the nature of the offense charged in or excludes any accused from the complaint or information, can be made only upon motion by the prosecutor, with notice to the offended party and with leave of court. The court shall state its reasons in resolving the motion and copies of its order shall be furnished all parties, especially the offended party.\nThus, before the accused enters his plea, a formal or substantial amendment of the complaint or information may be made without leave of court.\u00a0 After the entry of a plea, only a formal amendment may be made but with leave of court and if it does not prejudice the rights of the accused.\u00a0 After arraignment, a substantial amendment is proscribed except if the same is beneficial to the accused. [23]\n\nA substantial amendment consists of the recital of facts constituting the offense charged and determinative of the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 All other matters are merely of form. [24] The following have been held to be mere formal amendments: (1) new allegations which relate only to the range of the penalty that the court might impose in the event of conviction; (2) an amendment which does not charge another offense different or distinct from that charged in the original one; (3) additional allegations which do not alter the prosecution's theory of the case so as to cause surprise to the accused and affect the form of defense he has or will assume; (4) an amendment which does not adversely affect any substantial right of the accused; and (5) an amendment that merely adds specifications to eliminate vagueness in the information and not to introduce new and material facts, and merely states with additional precision something which is already contained in the original information and which adds nothing essential for conviction for the crime charged. [25]\n\nThe test as to whether a defendant is prejudiced by the amendment is whether a defense under the information as it originally stood would be available after the amendment is made, and whether any evidence defendant might have would be equally applicable to the information in the one form as in the other.\u00a0 An amendment to an information which does not change the nature of the crime alleged therein does not affect the essence of the offense or cause surprise or deprive the accused of an opportunity to meet the new averment had each been held to be one of form and not of substance. [26]\n\nIn the case at bar, the substitution of Caltex by PCIB as private complaint is not a substantial amendment. The substitution did not alter the basis of the charge in both Informations, nor did it result in any prejudice to petitioner. The documentary evidence in the form of the forged checks remained the same, and all such evidence was available to petitioner well before the trial. Thus, he cannot claim any surprise by virtue of the substitution.\n\nPetitioner next argues that in no way was PCIB subrogated to the rights of Caltex, considering that he has no knowledge of the subrogation much less gave his consent to it. Alternatively, he posits that if subrogation was proper, then the charges against him should be dismissed, the two Informations being \"defective and void due to false allegations.\"\nPetitioner was charged of the crime of estafa complex with falsification document. In estafa one of the essential elements \"to prejudice of another\" as\u00a0 mandated by article 315 of the Revise Penal Code.\n\nThe element of \"to the prejudice of another\" being as essential element of the felony should be clearly indicated and charged in the information with TRUTH AND LEGAL PRECISION.\n\nThis is not so in the case of petitioner, the twin information filed against him alleged the felony committed \" to the damage and prejudice of Caltex.\" This allegation is UNTRUE and FALSE\u00a0 for there is no question that as early as March 24, 1998 or THREE (3) LONG MONTHS before the twin information were filed on June 29, 1998, the prejudice party is already PCIBank since the latter Re-Credit the value of the checks to Caltex as early as March 24, 1998. In effect, assuming there is valid subrogation as the subject decision concluded, the subrogation took place an occurred on March 24, 1998 THREE (3) MONTHS before the twin information were filed.\n\nThe phrase \"to the prejudice to another\" as element of the felony is limited to the person DEFRAUDED in the very act of embezzlement. It should not be expanded to other persons which the loss may ultimately fall as a result of a contract which contract herein petitioner is total stranger.\n\nIn this case, there is no question that the very act of commission of the offense of September 24, 1997 and October 15, 1997 respectively, Caltex was the one defrauded by the act of the felony.\n\nIn the light of these facts, petitioner submits that the twin information are DEFECTIVE AND VOID due to the FALSE ALLEGATIONS that the offense was committed to the prejudice of Caltex when it truth and in fact the one prejudiced here was PCIBank.\n\nThe twin information being DEFECTIVE AND VOID, the same should be dismissed without prejudice to the filing of another information which should state the offense was committed to the prejudice of PCIBank if it still legally possible without prejudicing substantial and statutory rights of the petitioner. [27]\nPetitioner's argument on subrogation is misplaced. The Court agrees with respondent PCIB's comment that petitioner failed to make a distinction between legal and conventional subrogation. Subrogation is the transfer of all the rights of the creditor to a third person, who substitutes him in all his rights. [28] It may either be legal or conventional. Legal subrogation is that which takes place without agreement but by operation of law because of certain acts. [29] Instances of legal subrogation are those provided in Article 1302 [30] of the Civil Code. Conventional subrogation, on the other hand, is that which takes place by agreement of the parties. [31] Thus, petitioner's acquiescence is not necessary for subrogation to take place because the instant case is one of legal subrogation that occurs by operation of law, and without need of the debtor's knowledge.\n\nContrary to petitioner's asseverations, the case of People v. Yu Chai Ho [32] relied upon by the appellate court is in point. The Court declared -\nWe do not however, think that the fiscal erred in alleging that the commission of the crime resulted to the prejudice of Wm. H. Anderson & Co. It is true that originally the International Banking Corporation was the prejudiced party, but Wm. H. Anderson & Co. compensated it for its loss and thus became subrogated to all its rights against the defendant (article 1839, Civil Code). Wm. H. Anderson & Co., therefore, stood exactly in the shoes of the International Banking Corporation in relation to the defendant's acts, and the commission of the crime resulted to the prejudice of the firm previously to the filing of the information in the case. The loss suffered by the firm was the ultimate result of the defendant's unlawful acts, and we see no valid reason why this fact should not be stated in the information; it stands to reason that, in the crime of estafa , the damage resulting therefrom need not necessarily occur simultaneously with the acts constituting the other essential elements of the crime.\nThus, being subrogated to the right of Caltex, PCIB, through counsel, has the right to intervene in the proceedings, and under substantive laws is entitled to restitution of its properties or funds, reparation, or indemnification.\n\nPetitioner's gripe that the charges against him should be dismissed because the allegations in both Informations failed to name PCIB as true offended party does not hold water.\n\nSection 6, Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure states:\nSec. 6. Sufficiency of complaint or information . - A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time of the commission of the offense; and the place wherein the offense was committed.\n\nWhen the offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information.\nOn the other hand, Section 12 of the same Rule provides:\nSection. 12. Name of the offended party. - The complaint or information must state the name and surname of the person against whom or against whose property the offense was committed, or any appellation or nickname by which such person has been or is known. If there is no better way of identifying him, he must be described under a fictitious name.\n(a)\u00a0 In offenses against property, if the name of the offended party is unknown, the property must be described with such particularity as to properly identify the offense charged.\n\n(b) If the true name of the person against whom or against whose property the offense was committed is thereafter disclosed or ascertained, the court must cause such true name to be inserted in the complaint or information and the record.\n\n(c) If the offended party is a juridical person, it is sufficient to state its name, or any name or designation by which it is known or by which it may be identified, without need of averring that it is a juridical person or that it is organized in accordance with law. (12a)\nIn Sayson v. People , [33] the Court held that in case of offenses against property, the designation of the name of the offended party is not absolutely indispensable for as long as the criminal act charged in the complaint or information can be properly identified:\nThe rules on criminal procedure require the complaint or information to state the name and surname of the person against whom or against whose property the offense was committed or any appellation or nickname by which such person has been or is known and if there is no better way of Identifying him, he must be described under a fictitious name (Rule 110, Section 11, Revised Rules of Court; now Rule 110, Section 12 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure.] In case of offenses against property, the designation of the name of the offended party is not absolutely indispensable for as long as the criminal act charged in the complaint or information can be properly identified. Thus, Rule 110, Section 11 of the Rules of Court provides that:\n\nSection 11. Name of the offended party-\n...\n(a) In cases of offenses against property, if the name of the offended party is unknown, the property, subject matter of the offense, must be described with such particularity as to properly Identify the particular offense charged.\n\n(b) If in the course of the trial, the true name of the person against whom or against whose property the offense was committed\u00a0 is disclosed or ascertained, the court must cause the true name to be inserted in the complaint or information or record.\n...\nIn U.S. v. Kepner [1 Phil. 519 (1902)], this Court laid down the rule that when an offense shall have been described in the complaint with sufficient certainty as to Identify the act, an erroneous allegation as to the person injured shall be deemed immaterial as the same is a mere formal defect which did not tend to prejudice any substantial right of the defendant. Accordingly, in the aforementioned case, which had a factual backdrop similar to the instant case, where the defendant was charged with estafa for the misappropriation of the proceeds of a warrant which he had cashed without authority, the erroneous allegation in the complaint to the effect that the unlawful act was to the prejudice of the owner of the cheque, when in reality the bank which cashed it was the one which suffered a loss, was held to be immaterial on the ground that the subject matter of the estafa, the warrant, was described in the complaint with such particularity as to properly Identify the particular offense charged. In the instant suit for estafa which is a crime against property under the Revised Penal Code, since the check, which was the subject-matter of the offense, was described with such particularity as to properly identify the offense charged, it becomes immaterial, for purposes of convicting the accused, that it was established during the trial that the offended party was actually Mever Films and not Ernesto Rufino, Sr. nor Bank of America as alleged in the information.\nLastly, on petitioner's claim that he timely objected to the appearance of SRMO [34] as private prosecutor for PCIB, the Court agrees with the observation of the CA that contrary to his claim, petitioner did not question the said entry of appearance even as the RTC acknowledged the same on October 8, 1999. [35] Thus, petitioner cannot feign ignorance or surprise of the incident, which are \"all water under the bridge for [his] failure to make a timely objection thereto.\" [36]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED. The assailed decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED .

COURT OF APPEALS (FIFTEENTH DIVISION), NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC, THIRD DIVISION) AND RUFO PAMALO, JR., RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nTOWER INDUSTRIAL SALES AND JOHN KENNETH OCAMPO, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS (FIFTEENTH DIVISION), NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC, THIRD DIVISION) AND RUFO PAMALO, JR., RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nThe right to file a special civil action of certiorari is neither a natural right nor an essential element of due process; a writ of certiorari is a prerogative writ, never demandable as a matter of right, and never issued except in the exercise of judicial discretion. Hence, he who seeks a writ of certiorari must apply for it only in the manner and strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and the Rules. [1]\n\nThis Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court impugns the Resolution [2] dated 31 March 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 82933 dismissing the Petition for Annulment of the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which found private respondent Rufo Pamalo, Jr. to have been illegally dismissed. Said Resolution of the Court of Appeals succinctly stated:\n\nThis petition for annulment of the NLRC decision suffers from the following fatal deficiencies:\n(1) Per reading of the petition, this petition is treated as a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, not being a petition for annulment of NLRC decision;\n\n(2) Only Photostat copies were attached of the assailed NLRC decision dated November 29, 2002;\n\n(3) No certified true copies of pleadings and other supporting documents filed before the Labor Arbiter and NLRC were attached to the petition;\n\n(4) The Verification does not comply with Sec. 4, Rule 7 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended, which failed to manifest that the allegations were based on authentic records.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED. [3]\nLikewise impugned in this Petition for Certiorari is the Resolution [4] of the Court of Appeals dated 31 August 2004, denying the Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed:\n\nTower Industrial Sales, a company engaged in selling various brands of home appliances and managed by petitioner John Kenneth Ocampo, employed private respondent as a company driver in 1987. He worked everyday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and his last salary was pegged at P285.00 a day. [5]\n\nOn 12 February 2002, private respondent filed a Complaint with the Labor Arbiter for unfair labor practice and claimed overtime pay, premium for holiday pay and service incentive leave pay against Alon Development Corp. and/or Tower Industrial Sales, and Fernando Ocampo, [6] owner of both Alon Development Corp. and Tower Industrial Sales, and father of petitioner John Kenneth Ocampo. [7]\n\nOn 19 February 2002, a week after private respondent commenced the complaint with the Labor Arbiter, Fernando Ocampo issued a memorandum to the private respondent requiring him to explain his absence without official leave on said date. [8]\n\nOn 4 March 2002, another memorandum was issued to the private respondent requiring him to explain his absence from work on said date without permission from management and calling his attention to the fact that he had not submitted any explanation relative to the memorandum issued to him on 19 February 2002. [9]\n\nOn 6 March 2002, private respondent submitted his handwritten explanation regarding his absences, saying that with respect to his absence on 19 February 2002, at around 9:00 a.m., his wife left word to a certain Carol of petitioners' office that he cannot come to work as he was attending a wedding of a relative wherein he was a sponsor. He also explained that he failed to report for work on 4 March 2002 because he attended the hearing of the case he filed against the petitioners before the Labor Arbiter. [10]\n\nPrior to the above incidents, private respondent was also given a memorandum on 1 August 2001 as a warning for his absences in the month of July 2001. Moreover, he was given another memorandum on 13 August 2001 for damage to company property when he bumped a tree while driving the company's Toyota Camry car. He was required to pay half of the expenses for the repair of the damaged car. [11]\n\nOn 9 March 2002, Fernando Ocampo issued a memorandum putting private respondent on preventive suspension pending investigation of his case for gross misconduct, habitual tardiness and destruction of company property, and further requiring him to attend the hearing on 4 April 2002 at 3:00 p.m. at the conference room of petitioners' office. Petitioners' security guard, a certain Mr. Cornelio Rivera, allegedly handed a copy of the memorandum to private respondent, but the latter purportedly refused to acknowledge receipt thereof.\n\nPrivate respondent did not appear at the investigation on 4 April 2002. [12] Instead, on 18 April 2002, he filed an Amended Complaint for Illegal Dismissal on 9 March 2002 and claimed for overtime pay, premium for holiday pay and separation pay. In his position paper, he prayed for 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, overtime pay and legal holiday pay in addition to the charge of illegal dismissal. [13]\n\nOn 16 April 2002, Fernando Ocampo issued a notice of termination to the private respondent effective 9 March 2002 for gross misconduct and for committing acts prejudicial to the interest of the company. [14]\n\nOn 29 November 2002, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision in favor of petitioners, finding that private respondent was validly dismissed.\n\nRising to the occasion, private respondent filed a timely appeal to the NLRC.\n\nOn 28 November 2003, the NLRC reversed the Decision of the Labor Arbiter, disposing as follows:\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. Respondent Tower Industries Sales is ordered to reinstate the complainant and to pay him full backwages computed from his date of dismissal on March 14, 2002 up to his reinstatement, which is partially computed in the amount of one hundred seventy five thousand three hundred eighty eight pesos and 77/100 (P175,388.77), plus legal holiday pay of P8,500.00. [15] (Emphasis added)\nAggrieved by the NLRC decision, petitioners filed a Petition for Annulment of the same before the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Appeals denied said Petition for Annulment on the grounds which, for emphasis, are herein reiterated:\n(1) Per reading of the petition, this petition is treated as a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, not being a petition for annulment of NLRC decision;\n\n(2) Only Photostat copies were attached of the assailed NLRC decision dated November 29, 2002;\n\n(3) No certified true copies of pleadings and other supporting documents filed before the Labor Arbiter and NLRC were attached to the petition;\n\n(4) The Verification does not comply with Sec. 4, Rule 7 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended, which failed to manifest that the allegations were based on authentic records. [16]\nOn 15 July 2004, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied for having been filed 71 days late and for lack of merit.\n\nIn a last ditch effort at vindication, petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari raising the following issues:\nWHETHER THE NLRC HAD GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT REVERSED THE ARBITER'S DECISION UPHOLDING THE DISMISSAL FROM EMPLOYMENT OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT;\n\nWHETHER THE PETITIONERS ARE LIABLE TO PAY PRIVATE RESPONDENT HIS BACKWAGES;\n\nWHETHER THE PETITIONERS ARE OBLIGATED TO REINSTATE THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT AS DRIVER DESPITE STRAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PETITIONERS; AND\n\nWHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAD GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED THE PETITION OF THE PETITIONERS AND THEN LIKEWISE DENIED THEIR MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION. [17] The fundamental issues needing resolution are: (1) whether or not the dismissal of private respondent was valid, and (2) whether or not the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing CA-G.R. SP No. 82933 on purely technical grounds.\n\nWe shall discuss these issues jointly.\n\nIn brief, petitioners decry the decision of the NLRC for its failure to give weight to the evidence adduced by petitioners that private respondent's role as driver is vital to the viability of the business of petitioners, which demands that goods be delivered on time. Thus, petitioners lament that private respondent's proclivity to go on absences without leave, his habitual tardiness, and destruction of company property are detrimental to their business, which tendency smacks of gross misconduct - a just cause for the termination of employees under the Labor Code. [18]\n\nWe deviate from petitioners' standpoint.\n\nArticle 277 of the Labor Code, which guarantees the right of an employee to security of tenure, provides that -\n(b) Subject to the constitutional right of workers to security of tenure and their right to be protected against dismissal except for a just and authorized cause and without prejudice to the requirement of notice under Article 283 of this code the employer shall furnish the worker whose employment is sought to be terminated a written notice containing a statement of the causes for termination and shall afford the latter ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the assistance of his representative if he so desires in accordance with company rules and regulations x x x. (Emphasis supplied).\nIt is clear therefrom that the dismissal of private respondent may be sustained only if shown to have been made for a just and authorized cause and with due process.\n\nIn conjunction with the above-mentioned policy of the law, it is well-encrypted in our jurisprudence that the employer has the burden of proving that the dismissal is for just cause, and failure to do so would necessarily mean that the dismissal was unjustified and, therefore, illegal. It is the employer who must prove its validity, and not the employee who must prove its invalidity. To allow an employer to dismiss an employee based on mere allegations and generalities would place the employee in a dangerous situation. He would be at the mercy of his employer and the right to security of tenure, which this Court is bound to protect, would be unduly emasculated. [19]\n\nPatently, the Labor Arbiter clearly lost sight of the foregoing doctrine when he held that the claim of private respondent that he was illegally dismissed suffers from lack of substantial proof to warrant an affirmative finding that he was illegally dismissed without just cause. [20]\n\nIn contrast, respondent NLRC, mindful that it is the employer which has the onus probandi to show that private respondent's dismissal was based on a valid ground, evaluated the evidence presented before the Labor Arbiter and concluded that the charges hurled by petitioners against private respondent to justify his termination were baseless.\n\nDoctrinally, the findings of fact of the NLRC are conclusive on this Court, absent a showing that they were reached arbitrarily. [21] Here, the Court finds no cogent reason to deflect from the findings of the NLRC. We are, thus, bound by the findings of the NLRC that the alleged infractions of private respondent do not constitute gross misconduct to warrant his dismissal from service. Indeed, petitioners cannot rely merely on the weakness of the defense of private respondent or on his failure to present evidence to disprove the charge of gross misconduct. In the absence of substantial evidence, the contentions of petitioners are self-serving and incapable of showing that the dismissal of private respondent was justified. [22]\n\nRightly so, we give the stamp of approval to the following factual findings of the NLRC that the acts committed by private respondent that were characterized by the petitioners as gross misconduct, i.e., his absences from work on 19 February 2002 and 4 March 2002 without prior permission from the petitioners, as well as his past absences in the month of July 2001 and damage to the company car when he bumped it against a tree on 11 August 2002, are past infractions that the latter had already been duly penalized for the commissions thereof. Past infractions cannot be collectively taken as a justification for his dismissal from the service. [23]\n\nWe hasten to add that anent the damage to petitioners' Toyota Camry car, private respondent had been paying half of the damage of which P250.00 was being deducted to his pay, as the records show. [24] Thus, this issue is now water under the bridge and must not be revived anew to rationalize private respondent's dismissal from his work - his bread and butter for the past 15 years prior to his termination.\n\nAs regards the absences without official leave incurred on 19 February 2002 and 4 March 2002, we are equally bound by the findings of the NLRC that while they are clear violations of company rules, they cannot be considered as grave enough to amount to gross misconduct. We add that in private respondent's 15 years of service with petitioners, a day or two's absences without prior leave is trivial; hardly of habitual character.\n\nOn another note, we cannot ignore the fact that private respondent's dismissal was spurred by his filing of a labor case against petitioners for overtime pay, service incentive leave, and holiday pay. Private respondent must not be punished for asserting his rights and for tapping all legal avenues to address clear violations of such rights. All things being equal, private respondent's termination soon after he filed the labor case against his erring employer is a badge of bad faith on the part of the latter, undeserving of sympathy from this Court.\n\nIn hindsight, if, indeed, private respondent was a wayward employee, why did petitioners countenance such behavior for no less than 15 years?\n\nNeither can this Court give credence to petitioners' argument that the reinstatement of private respondent is no longer possible because of the strained relations between the petitioners, on one hand, and the private respondent on the other. Strained relations must be demonstrated as a fact, adequately supported by evidence on record. [25] Mere allegations of such by the petitioners, without evidence, are self-serving. It bears emphasis that the NLRC, based on the evidence presented before it, concluded that reinstatement is still possible in the present case, a finding which we have no reason to disturb.\n\nPetitioners allege that their strained relations with private respondent resulted from the latter's absences without leave, habitual tardiness and reckless disregard of safety precautions. These are the very same allegations presented by petitioners as justifying reasons for dismissing private respondent and which the NLRC and, now, this Court, declared to be baseless. Petitioners' claim that they will \"not feel at ease with private respondent\" if he continues to drive for them hardly constitute strained relations. What is more plausible is that petitioners feel some antagonism against private respondent for instituting a labor case against them. As expounded by this Court in Kunting v. National Labor Relations Commission [26] \"\n\"Strained relations,' as amplified in Employee's Association of the Philippine American Life Insurance Company v. NLRC, 199 SCRA 628 [1991], must be of such a nature or degree as to preclude reinstatement. But, where the differences between the parties are neither personal nor physical, nor serious, then there is no reason why the illegally dismissed employee should not be reinstated rather than simply given separation pay and backwages. More so if the cause of the perceived \"strained relations\" is the filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal. As the Court held in Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corporation v. NLRC, 206 SCRA 701 [1992], citing Anscor Transport and Terminals v. NLRC, 190 SCRA 147 [1990]; Sibal v. Notre Dame of Greater Manila, 182 SCRA 538 [1990]:\n\"Obviously, the principle of \"strained relations\" cannot be applied indiscriminately. Otherwise, reinstatement can never be possible simply because some hostility is invariably engendered between the parties as a result of litigation. That is human nature.\n\n\"Besides, no strained relations should arise from a valid and legal act of asserting one's right; otherwise an employee who shall assert his right could be easily separated from the service, by merely paying his separation pay on the pretext that his relationship with his employer had already become strained.\"\nStill contrary to petitioners' position, this Court cannot attribute any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals for thwarting their efforts to reverse the NLRC decision. Considering that petitioners failed to show any redeeming value of their petition for annulment of the NLRC decision, which the Court of Appeals treated as a petition for certiorari, it came as no surprise that the Court of Appeals nipped their dilatory tactics in the bud and dismissed said petition outright.\n\nTrue, the Court of Appeals anchored the denial of petition for annulment of the NLRC decision on merely technical grounds. Equally true, Rule 1, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure [27] provides that said rules should be construed liberally to effect substantial justice. All these do not mean, however, that procedural rules are to be ignored or disdained at will to suit the convenience of a party. [28]\n\nIn MTM Garment Manufacturing Incorporated v. Court of Appeals, [29] we stressed that the right to file a special civil action of certiorari is neither a natural right nor an essential element of due process; a writ of certiorari is a prerogative writ, never demandable as a matter of right, and never issued except in the exercise of judicial discretion. Hence, he who seeks a writ of certiorari must apply for it only in the manner and strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and the Rules . [30]\n\nIn the same vein, in NYK International Knitwear Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, [31] this Court did not mince words in ruling that for this Court to issue the extraordinary writ of certiorari to reverse the Court of Appeals' denial of a petition on technical grounds there must exist compelling reason to do so. Thus-\nThe members of this Court are not unmindful that in exceptional cases and for compelling reasons, we have disregarded similar procedural defects in order to correct a patent injustice made. However, petitioners here have not shown any compelling reason for us to relax the rule. Petitioners are hereby reminded that the right to file a special civil action of certiorari is neither a natural right nor a part of due process. A writ of certiorari is a prerogative writ, never demandable as a matter of right, never issued except in the exercise of judicial discretion. Hence, he who seeks a writ of certiorari must apply for it only in the manner and strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and the Rules. [32]\nHence, inasmuch as the NLRC decision was based on substantial evidence on record and its conclusions were in rhyme with the applicable law and prevailing jurisprudence on the matter, there is, therefore, not an iota of doubt as to the soundness of said decision to warrant a relaxation by the Court of Appeals of the technical rules of procedure.\n\nFor our part, given the factual milieu of this case, there is nothing legally revolting about the assailed resolution of the Court of Appeals to warrant the issuance of the extraordinary writ of certiorari that petitioners pray from this Court.\n\nAs a postscript, private respondent remains unemployed to date, despite diligent efforts to hunt for a job, because of his advanced age. [33] This all the more behooves this Court to affirm the impugned resolutions of the Court of Appeals and write finis to this case lest the beneficence of the rule on security of tenure continue to elude the private respondent through the protracted twists and turns of this case.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DISMISSED . The Resolution [34] dated 31 March 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 82933 and the Resolution [35] dated 31 August 2004, denying the Motion for Reconsideration, are hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nWith costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chiarperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] MTM Garment Manufacturing, Incorporated v.

NO. 166714, February 09, 2007 ]\n\nAMELIA S. ROBERTS, PETITIONER, VS. MARTIN B. PAPIO, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nAMELIA S. ROBERTS, PETITIONER, VS. MARTIN B. PAPIO, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nAssailed in this petition for review on certiorari is the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. CV No. 69034 which reversed and set aside the Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 150, Makati City, in Civil Case No. 01-431. The RTC ruling had affirmed with modification the Decision [3] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 64, Makati City in Civil Case No. 66847. The petition likewise assails the Resolution of the CA denying the motion for reconsideration of its decision.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nThe spouses Martin and Lucina Papio were the owners of a 274-square-meter residential lot located in Makati (now Makati City) and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. S-44980. [4] In order to secure a P59,000.00 loan from the Amparo Investments Corporation, they executed a real estate mortgage on the property. Upon Papio's failure to pay the loan, the corporation filed a petition for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage.\n\nSince the couple needed money to redeem the property and to prevent the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage, they executed a Deed of Absolute Sale over the property on April 13, 1982 in favor of Martin Papio's cousin, Amelia Roberts. \u00a0Of the P85,000.00 purchase price, P59,000.00 was paid to the Amparo Investments Corporation, while the P26,000.00 difference was retained by the spouses. [5] As soon as the spouses had settled their obligation, the corporation returned the owner's duplicate of TCT No. S-44980, which was then delivered to Amelia Roberts.\n\nThereafter, the parties (Amelia Roberts as lessor and Martin Papio as lessee) executed a two-year contract of lease dated April 15, 1982, effective May 1, 1982. The contract was subject to renewal or extension for a like period at the option of the lessor, the lessee waiving thereby the benefits of an implied new lease. The lessee was obliged to pay monthly rentals of P800.00 to be deposited in the lessor's account at the Bank of America, Makati City branch. [6]\n\nOn July 6, 1982, TCT No. S-44980 was cancelled, and TCT No. 114478 was issued in the name of Amelia Roberts as owner. [7]\n\nMartin Papio paid the rentals from May 1, 1982 to May 1, 1984, and thereafter, for another year. [8] He then failed to pay rentals, but he and his family nevertheless remained in possession of the property for a period of almost thirteen (13) years.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 1998, Amelia Roberts, through counsel, reminded Papio that he failed to pay the monthly rental of P2,500.00 from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1997,\u00a0 and P10,000.00 from January 1, 1998 to May 31, 1998; thus, his total liability was P410,000.00. She demanded that Papio vacate the property within 15 days from receipt of the letter in case he failed to settle the amount. [9] Because he refused to pay, Papio received another letter from Roberts on April 22, 1999, demanding, for the last time, that he and his family vacate the property. [10] Again, Papio refused to leave the premises.\n\nOn June 28, 1999, Amelia Roberts, through her attorney-in-fact, Matilde Aguilar, filed a Complaint [11] for unlawful detainer and damages against Martin Papio before the MeTC, Branch 64, Makati City. She alleged the following in her complaint:\n\nSometime in 1982 she purchased from defendant a 274-sq-m residential house and lot situated at No. 1046 Teresa St., Brgy. Valenzuela, Makati City. [12] Upon Papio's pleas to continue staying in the property, they executed a two-year lease contract [13] which commenced on \u00a0May 1, 1982. \u00a0The monthly rental was P800.00. Thereafter, TCT No. 114478 [14] was issued in her favor and she paid all the realty taxes due on the property. When the term of the lease expired, she still allowed Papio and his family to continue leasing the property. \u00a0However, he took advantage of her absence and stopped payment beginning January 1986, and refused to pay despite repeated demands. \u00a0In June 1998, she sent a demand letter [15] through counsel requiring Papio to pay rentals from January 1986 up to May 1998\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0and to vacate the leased property. \u00a0The accumulated arrears in rental are as follows: (a) P360,000.00 from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1997 at P2,500.00 per month; and (b) P50,000.00, from January 1, 1998 to May 31, 1998 at P10,000.00 per month. [16] She came to the Philippines but all efforts at an amicable settlement proved futile. Thus, in April 1999, she sent the final demand letter to defendant directing him and his family to pay and immediately vacate the leased premises. [17]\n\nRoberts appended to her complaint copies of the April 13, 1982 Deed of Absolute Sale, the April 15, 1982 Contract of Lease, and TCT No. 114478.\n\nIn his Answer with counterclaim, Papio alleged the following:\n\nHe executed the April 13, 1982 deed of absolute sale and the contract of lease.\u00a0 Roberts, his cousin who is a resident of California, United States of America (USA), arrived in the Philippines and offered to redeem the property.\u00a0 Believing that she had made the offer for the purpose of retaining his ownership over the property, he accepted. She then remitted P59,000.00 to the mortgagor for his account, after which the mortgagee cancelled the real estate mortgage. However, he was alarmed when the plaintiff had a deed of absolute sale over the property prepared (for P83,000.00 as consideration) and asked him to sign the same. She also demanded that the defendant turn over the owner's duplicate of TCT No. S-44980. \u00a0The defendant was in a quandary. \u00a0He then believed that if he signed the deed of absolute sale, Roberts would acquire ownership over the property. \u00a0He asked her to allow him to redeem or reacquire the property at any time for a reasonable amount. [18] When Roberts agreed, Papio signed the deed of absolute sale.\n\nPursuant to the right to redeem/repurchase given him by Roberts, Papio purchased the property for P250,000.00. \u00a0In July 1985, since Roberts was by then already in the USA, he remitted to her authorized representative, Perlita Ventura, the amount of P150,000.00 as partial payment for the property. [19] On June 16, 1986, she again remitted P100,000.00, through Ventura. \u00a0Both payments were evidenced by receipts signed by Ventura. [20] Roberts then declared that she would execute\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0a deed of absolute sale and surrender the title to the property. However, Ventura had apparently misappropriated P39,000.00 out of the P250,000.00 that she had received; Roberts then demanded that she pay the amount misappropriated before executing the deed of absolute sale. Thus, the sole reason why Roberts refused to abide by her promise was the failure of her authorized representative to remit the full amount of P250,000.00. Despite Papio's demands, Roberts refused to execute a deed of absolute sale. Accordingly, defendant posited that plaintiff had no cause of action to demand payment of rental and eject him from the property.\n\nPapio appended to his Answer the following: (1) the letter dated \u00a0\u00a0July 18, 1986 of Perlita Ventura to the plaintiff wherein the former admitted having used the money of the plaintiff to defray the plane fares of Perlita's parents to the USA, and pleaded that she be allowed to repay the amount within one year; (b) the letter of Eugene Roberts (plaintiff's husband) to Perlita Ventura dated July 25, 1986 where he accused Ventura of stealing the money of plaintiff Amelia (thus preventing the latter from paying her loan on her house and effect the cancellation of the mortgage), and demanded that she deposit the balance; [21] and (c) plaintiff's letter to defendant Papio dated \u00a0\u00a0July 25, 1986 requesting the latter to convince Ventura to remit the balance of P39,000.00 so that the plaintiff could transfer the title of the property to the defendant. [22]\n\nPapio asserted that the letters of Roberts and her husband are in themselves admissions or declarations against interest, hence, admissible to prove that he had reacquired the property although the title was still in her possession.\n\nIn her Affidavit and Position Paper, [23] Roberts averred that she had paid the real estate taxes on the property after she had purchased it; Papio's initial right to occupy the property was terminated when the original lease period expired; and his continued possession was only by mere tolerance. She further alleged that the Deed of Sale states on its face that the conveyance of the property was absolute and unconditional. She also claimed that any right to repurchase the property must appear in a public document pursuant to Article 1358, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code of the Phililppines. [24] Since no such document exists, defendant's supposed real interest over the property could not be enforced without violating the Statute of Frauds. [25] She stressed that her Torrens title to the property was an \"absolute and indefeasible evidence of her ownership of the property which is binding and conclusive upon the whole world.\"\n\nRoberts admitted that she demanded P39,000.00 from the defendant in her letter dated July 25, 1986. \u00a0However, she averred that the amount represented his back rentals on the property. [26] She declared that she neither authorized Ventura to sell the property nor to receive the purchase price therefor. \u00a0She merely authorized her to receive the rentals from defendant and to deposit them in her account. She did not know that Ventura had received P250,000.00 from Papio in July 1985 and on June 16, 1986, and had signed receipts therefor.\u00a0 It was only on February 11, 1998 that she became aware of the receipts when she received defendant Papio's letter to which were appended the said receipts.\u00a0 She and her husband offered to sell the property to the defendant in 1984 for US$15,000.00 on a \"take it or leave it\" basis when they arrived in the Philippines in May 1984. [27] However, defendant refused to accept the offer.\u00a0 The spouses then offered to sell the property anew on December 20, 1997, for P670,000.00 inclusive of back rentals. [28] However, defendant offered to settle his account with the spouses. [29] Again, the offer came on January 11, 1998, but it was rejected.\u00a0 The defendant insisted that he had already purchased the property in July 1985 for P250,000.00.\n\nRoberts insisted that Papio's claim of the right to repurchase the property, as well as his claim of payment therefor, is belied by his own letter in which he offered to settle plaintiff's claim for back rentals. Even assuming that the purchase price of the property had been paid through Ventura, Papio did not adduce any proof to show that Ventura had been authorized to sell the property or to accept any payment thereon. Any payment to Ventura could have no binding effect on her since she was not privy to the transaction; if at all, such agreement would be binding only on Papio and Ventura.\n\nShe further alleged that defendant's own inaction belies his claim of ownership over the property: first, he failed to cause any notice or annotation to be made on the Register of Deed's copy of TCT No. 114478 in order to protect his supposed adverse claim; second, he did not institute any action against Roberts to compel the execution of the necessary deed of transfer of title in his favor; and third, the defense of ownership over the property was raised only after Roberts demanded him to vacate the property.\n\nBased solely on the parties' pleadings, the MeTC rendered its January 18, 2001 Decision [30] in favor of Roberts.\u00a0 The fallo of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, finding this case for the plaintiff, the defendant is hereby ordered to:\nVacate the leased premises known as 1046 Teresa St., Valenzuela, Makati City;\n\nPay plaintiff the reasonable rentals accrual for the period January 1, 1996 to December 13, 1997 at the rate equivalent to Php2,500.00 per month and thereafter, Php10,000.00 from January 1998 until he actually vacates the premises;\n\nPay the plaintiff attorney's fees as Php20,000.00; and\n\nPay the costs\nSO ORDERED. [31]\nThe MeTC held that Roberts merely tolerated the stay of Papio in the property after the expiration of the contract of lease on May 1, 1984; hence, she had a cause of action against him since the only elements in an unlawful detainer action are the fact of lease and the expiration of its term. The defendant as tenant cannot controvert the title of the plaintiff or assert any right adverse thereto or set up any inconsistent right to change the existing relation between them. \u00a0The plaintiff need not prove her ownership over the property inasmuch as evidence of ownership can be admitted only for the purpose of determining the character and extent of possession, and the amount of damages arising from the detention.\n\nThe court further ruled that Papio made no denials as to the existence and authenticity of Roberts' title to the property. It declared that \"the certificate of title is indefeasible in favor of the person whose name appears therein and incontrovertible upon the expiration of the one-year period from the date of issue,\" and that a Torrens title, \"which enjoys a strong presumption of regularity and validity, is generally a conclusive evidence of ownership of the land referred to therein.\"\n\nAs to Papio's claim that the transfer of the property was one with right of repurchase, the MeTC held it to be bereft of merit since the Deed of Sale is termed as \"absolute and unconditional.\"\u00a0 The court ruled that the right to repurchase is not a right granted to the seller by the buyer in a subsequent instrument but rather, a right reserved in the same contract of sale.\u00a0 Once the deed of absolute sale is executed, the seller can no longer reserve the right to repurchase; any right thereafter granted in a separate document cannot be a right of repurchase but some other right.\n\nAs to the receipts of payment signed by Ventura, the court gave credence to Roberts's declaration in her Affidavit that she authorized Ventura only to collect rentals from Papio, and not to receive the repurchase price.\u00a0 Papio's letter of January 31, 1998, which called her attention to the fact that she had been sending people without written authority to collect money since 1985, bolstered the court's finding that the payment, if at all intended for the supposed repurchase, never redounded to the benefit of the spouses Roberts.\n\nPapio appealed the decision to the RTC, alleging the following:\nI.\nTHE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE CASE FOR EJECTMENT OUTRIGHT ON THE GROUND OF LACK OF CAUSE OF ACTION.\n\nII.\nTHE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WHICH ESTABLISHED THAT A REPURCHASE TRANSACTION EXISTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES ONLY THAT PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE WITHHELD THE EXECUTION OF THE ABSOLUTE DEED OF SALE AND THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OF THE SAME IN DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S NAME.\n\nIII.\nTHE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE LETTERS OF PLAINTIFF-[APPELLEE]\u00a0 AND OF HER HUSBAND ADDRESSED TO DEFENDANT-APPELLANT AND HIS WIFE ARE IN THEMSELVES ADMISSION AND/OR DECLARATION OF THE FACT\u00a0 THAT DEFENDANT-APPELLANT HAD DULY PAID PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE OF THE PURCHASE AMOUNT COVERING THE SUBJECT PROPERTY.\n\nIV.\nTHE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE CASE FOR EJECTMENT OUTRIGHT CONSIDERING THAT PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE WHO IS [AN] AMERICAN CITIZEN AND RESIDENT THEREIN HAD NOT APPEARED IN COURT ONCE, NEITHER WAS HER ALLEGED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, MATILDE AGUILAR NOR [DID] THE LATTER EVER [FURNISH] THE LOWER COURT A SPECIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY AUTHORIZING HER TO APPEAR IN COURT IN BEHALF OF HER PRINCIPAL. [32]\nPapio maintained that Roberts had no cause of action for eviction because she had already ceded her right thereto when she allowed him to redeem and reacquire the property upon payment of P250,000.00 to Ventura, her duly authorized representative. He also contended that Roberts's claim that the authority of Ventura is limited only to the collection of the rentals and not of the purchase price was a mere afterthought, since her appended Affidavit was executed sometime in October 1999 when the proceedings in the MeTC had already started.\n\nOn March 26, 2001, Roberts filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution. [33] The court granted the motion in an Order [34] dated June 19, 2001. \u00a0Subsequently, a Writ of Execution [35] pending appeal was issued on September 28, 2001. On October 29, 2001, Sheriff Melvin M. Alidon enforced the writ and placed Roberts in possession of the property.\n\nMeanwhile, Papio filed a complaint with the RTC of Makati City, for specific performance with damages against Roberts. Papio, as plaintiff, claimed that he entered into a contract of sale with pacto de retro with Roberts, and prayed that the latter be ordered to execute a Deed of Sale over `the property in his favor and transfer the title over the property to and in his name.\u00a0 The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 01-851.\n\nOn October 24, 2001, the RTC rendered judgment affirming the appealed decision of the MeTC.\u00a0 The fallo of the decision reads: [36]\nBeing in accordance with law and the circumstances attendant to the instant case, the court finds merit in plaintiff-appellee's claim. Wherefore, the challenged decision dated January 18, 2001 is hereby affirmed in toto.\n\nSO ORDERED. [37]\nBoth parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration. [38] In an Order [39] dated February 26, 2002, the court denied the motion of Papio but modified its decision declaring that the computation of the accrued rentals should commence from January 1986, not January 1996.\u00a0 The decretal portion of the decision reads:\nWherefore, the challenged decision dated January 18, 2001 is hereby affirmed with modification that defendant pay plaintiff the reasonable rentals accrued for the period January 1, 1986 to December [31, 1997] per month and thereafter and P10,000.00 [per month] from \u00a0January 1998 to October 28, 2001 when defendant-appellant actually vacated the subject leased premises.\n\nSO ORDERED. [40]\nOn February 28, 2002, Papio filed a\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0petition for review [41] in the CA, alleging that the RTC erred in not finding that he had reacquired the property from Roberts for P250,000.00, but the latter refused to execute a deed of absolute sale and transfer the title in his favor.\u00a0 He insisted that the MeTC and the RTC erred in giving credence to petitioner's claim that she did not authorize Ventura to receive his payments for the purchase price of the property, citing Roberts' letter dated July 25, 1986 and the letter of Eugene Roberts to Ventura of even date. \u00a0He also averred that the MeTC and the RTC erred in not considering his documentary evidence in deciding the case.\n\nOn August 31, 2004, the CA rendered judgment granting the petition.\u00a0 The appellate court set aside the decision of the RTC and ordered the RTC to dismiss the complaint. The decretal portion of the Decision [42] reads:\nWHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered: (1) rendering an initial determination that the \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" dated April 13, 1982 is in fact an equitable mortgage under Article 1603 of the New Civil Code; and (2) resolving therefore that petitioner Martin B. Papio is entitled to possession of the property subject of this action; (3) But such determination of ownership and equitable mortgage are not clothed with finality and will not constitute a binding and conclusive adjudication on the merits with respect to the issue of ownership and such judgment shall not bar an action between the same parties respecting title to the land, nor shall it be held conclusive of the facts therein found in the case between the same parties upon a different cause of action not involving possession. All other counterclaims for damages are hereby dismissed. Cost against the respondent.\n\nSO ORDERED. [43]\nAccording to the appellate court, although the MeTC and RTC were correct in holding that the MeTC had jurisdiction over the complaint for unlawful detainer, they erred in ignoring Papio's defense of equitable mortgage, and in not finding that the transaction covered by the deed of absolute sale by and between the parties was one of equitable mortgage under Article 1602 of the New Civil Code. The appellate court ruled that Papio retained the ownership of the property and its peaceful possession; hence, the MeTC should have dismissed the complaint without prejudice to the outcome of Civil Case No. 01-851 relative to his claim of ownership over the property.\n\nRoberts filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision on the following grounds:\nPetitioner did not allege in his Answer the defense of equitable mortgage; hence, the lower courts [should] not have discussed the same;\n\nEven assuming that Petitioner alleged the defense of equitable mortgage, the MeTC could not have ruled upon the said defense,\n\nThe M[e]TC and the RTC were not remiss in the exercise of their jurisdiction. [44]\nThe CA denied the motion.\n\nIn this petition for review, Amelia Salvador-Roberts, as petitioner, avers that:\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVEOUSLY (SIC) ERRED IN DECLARING THAT THE M[e]TC AN(D) THE RTC WERE REMISS IN THE EXERCISE OF THAT JURISDICTION ACQUIRED BECAUSE IT DID NOT CONSIDER ALL PETITIONER'S DEFENSE OF EQUITABLE MORTGAGE.\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVEOUSLY (SIC) ERRED IN REQUIRING THE M[e]TC AND RTC TO RULE ON A DEFENSE WHICH WAS NEVER AVAILED OF BY RESPONDENT. [45]\nPetitioner argues that respondent is barred from raising the issue of equitable mortgage because his defense in the MeTC and RTC was that he had repurchased the property from the petitioner; by such representation, he had impliedly admitted the existence and validity of the deed of absolute sale whereby ownership of the property was transferred to petitioner but reverted to him upon the exercise of said right. The respondent even filed a complaint for specific performance with damages, which is now pending in the RTC of Makati City, docketed as Civil Case No. 01-851 entitled \"Martin B. Papio vs. Amelia Salvador-Roberts.\" In that case, respondent claimed that his transaction with the petitioner was a sale with pacto de retro. \u00a0Petitioner posits that Article 1602 of the Civil Code applies only when the defendant specifically alleges this defense. Consequently, the appellate court was proscribed from finding that petitioner and respondent had entered into an equitable mortgage under the deed of absolute sale.\n\nPetitioner further avers that respondent was ably represented by counsel and was aware of the difference between a pacto de retro sale and an equitable mortgage; thus, he could not have been mistaken in declaring that he repurchased the property from her.\n\nAs to whether a sale is in fact an equitable mortgage, petitioner claims that the issue should be properly addressed and resolved by the RTC in an action to enforce ownership, not in an ejectment case before the MeTC where the main issue involved is possession de facto. According to her, the obvious import of the CA Decision is that, in resolving an ejectment case, the lower court must pass upon the issue of ownership (in this case, by applying the presumptions under Art. 1602) which, in effect, would use the same yardstick as though it is the main action. The procedure will not only promote multiplicity of suits but also place the new owner in the absurd position of having to first seek the declaration of ownership before filing an ejectment suit.\n\nRespondent counters that the defense of equitable mortgage need not be particularly stated to apprise petitioner of the nature and character of the repurchase agreement. He contends that he had amply discussed in his pleadings before the trial and appellate courts all the surrounding circumstances of the case, such as the relative situation of the parties at the time; their attitude, acts, conduct, and declarations; and the negotiations between them that led to the repurchase agreement. Thus, he argues that the CA correctly ruled that the contract was one of equitable mortgage.\u00a0 He insists that petitioner allowed him to redeem and reacquire the property, and accepted his full payment of the property through Ventura, the authorized representative, as shown by the signed receipts.\n\nThe threshold issues are the following: (1) whether the MeTC had jurisdiction in an action for unlawful detainer to resolve the issue of who between petitioner and respondent is the owner of the property and entitled to the de facto possession thereof; (2) whether the transaction entered into between the parties under the Deed of Absolute Sale and the Contract of Lease is an equitable mortgage over the property; and (3) whether the petitioner is entitled to the material or de facto possession of the property.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nOn the first issue, the CA ruling (which upheld the jurisdiction of the MeTC to resolve the issue of who between petitioner or respondent is the lawful owner of the property, and is thus entitled to the material or de facto possession thereof) is correct.\u00a0 Section 18, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court provides that when the defendant raises the defense of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership, the issue of ownership shall be resolved only to determine the issue of possession. The judgment rendered in an action for unlawful detainer shall be conclusive with respect to the possession only and shall in no wise bind the title or affect the ownership of the land or building. \u00a0Such judgment would not bar an action between the same parties respecting title to the land or building. [46]\n\nThe summary nature of the action is not changed by the claim of ownership of the property of the defendant. [47] The MeTC is not divested of its jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer action simply because the defendant asserts ownership over the property.\n\nThe sole issue for resolution in an action for unlawful detainer is material or de facto possession of the property. \u00a0Even if the defendant claims juridical possession or ownership over the property based on a claim that his transaction with the plaintiff relative to the property is merely an equitable mortgage, or that he had repurchased the property from the plaintiff, the MeTC may still delve into and take cognizance of the case and make an initial or provisional determination of who between the plaintiff and the defendant is the owner and, in the process, resolve the issue of who is entitled to the possession. The MeTC, in unlawful detainer case, decides the question of ownership only if it is intertwined with and necessary to resolve the issue of possession. [48] The resolution of the MeTC on the ownership of the property is merely provisional or interlocutory. \u00a0Any question involving the issue of ownership should be raised and resolved in a separate action brought specifically to settle the question with finality, in this case, Civil Case No. 01-851 which respondent filed before the RTC.\n\nThe ruling of the CA, that the contract between petitioner and respondent was an equitable mortgage, is incorrect. The fact of the matter is that the respondent intransigently alleged in his answer, and even in his affidavit and position paper, that petitioner had granted him the right to redeem or repurchase the property at any time and for a reasonable amount; and that, he had, in fact, repurchased the property in July 1985 for P250,000.00 which he remitted to petitioner through an authorized representative who signed receipts therefor; he had reacquired ownership and juridical possession of the property after his repurchase thereof in 1985; and consequently, petitioner was obliged to execute a deed of absolute sale over the property in his favor.\n\nNotably, respondent alleged that, as stated in his letter to petitioner, he was given the right to reacquire the property in 1982 within two years upon the payment of P53,000.00, plus petitioner's airfare for her trip to the Philippines from the USA and back; petitioner promised to sign the deed of absolute sale. \u00a0He even filed a complaint against the petitioner in the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 01-851, for specific performance with damages to compel petitioner to execute the said deed of absolute sale over the property presumably on the strength of Articles 1357 and 1358 of the New Civil Code. \u00a0Certainly then, his claim that petitioner had given him the right to repurchase the property is antithetical to an equitable mortgage.\n\nAn equitable mortgage is one that, although lacking in some formality, form or words, or other requisites demanded by a statute, nevertheless reveals the intention of the parties to change a real property as security for a debt and contain nothing impossible or contrary to law. [49] A contract between the parties is an equitable mortgage if the following requisites are present: (a) the parties entered into a contract denominated as a contract of sale; and (b) the intention was to secure an existing debt by way of mortgage. [50] The decisive factor is the intention of the parties.\n\nIn an equitable mortgage, the mortgagor retains ownership over the property but subject to foreclosure and sale at public auction upon failure of the mortgagor to pay his obligation. [51] In contrast, in a pacto de retro sale, ownership of the property sold is immediately transferred to the vendee a retro subject only to the right of the vendor a retro to repurchase the property upon compliance with legal requirements for the repurchase. The failure of the vendor a retro to exercise the right to repurchase within the agreed time vests upon the vendee a retro, by operation of law, absolute title over the property. [52]\n\nOne repurchases only what one has previously sold.\u00a0 The right to repurchase presupposes a valid contract of sale between the same parties. [53] By insisting that he had repurchased the property, respondent thereby admitted that the deed of absolute sale executed by him and petitioner on April 13, 1982 was, in fact and in law, a deed of absolute sale and not an equitable mortgage; hence, he had acquired ownership over the property based on said deed.\u00a0 Respondent is, thus, estopped from asserting that the contract under the deed of absolute sale is an equitable mortgage unless there is allegation and evidence of palpable mistake on the part of respondent; [54] or a fraud on the part of petitioner.\u00a0 Respondent made no such allegation in his pleadings and affidavit. On the contrary, he maintained that petitioner had sold the property to him in July 1985 and acknowledged receipt of the purchase price thereof except the amount of P39,000.00 retained by Perlita Ventura. Respondent is thus bound by his admission of petitioner's ownership of the property and is barred from claiming otherwise. [55]\n\nRespondent's admission that petitioner acquired ownership over the property under the April 13, 1982 deed of absolute sale is buttressed by his admission in the Contract of Lease dated April 15, 1982 that petitioner was the owner of the property, and that he had paid the rentals for the duration of the contract of lease and even until 1985 upon its extension. \u00a0Respondent was obliged to prove his defense that petitioner had given him the right to repurchase, and that petitioner obliged herself to resell the property for P250,000.00 when they executed the April 13, 1982 deed of absolute sale.\n\nWe have carefully reviewed the case and find that respondent failed to adduce competent and credible evidence to prove his claim.\n\nAs gleaned from the April 13, 1982 deed, the right of respondent to repurchase the property is not incorporated therein. The contract is one of absolute sale and not one with right to repurchase. \u00a0The law states that if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control. [56] When the language of the contract is explicit, leaving no doubt as to the intention of the drafters, the courts may not read into it any other intention that would contradict its plain import. [57] The clear terms of the contract should never be the subject matter of interpretation.\u00a0 Neither abstract justice nor the rule of liberal interpretation justifies the creation of a contract for the parties which they did not make themselves, or the imposition upon one party to a contract or obligation to assume simply or merely to avoid seeming hardships. [58] Their true meaning must be enforced, as it is to be presumed that the contracting parties know their scope and effects. [59] As the Court held in Villarica, et al. v. Court of Appeals: [60]\nThe right of repurchase is not a right granted the vendor by the vendee in a subsequent instrument, but is a right reserved by the vendor in the same instrument of sale as one of the stipulations of the contract.\u00a0 Once the instrument of absolute sale is executed, the vendor can no longer reserve the right to repurchase, and any right thereafter granted the vendor by the vendee in a separate instrument cannot be a right of repurchase but some other right like the option to buy in the instant case. [61]\nIn Ramos v. Icasiano , [62] we also held that an agreement to repurchase becomes a promise to sell when made after the sale because when the sale is made without such agreement the purchaser acquires the thing sold absolutely; and, if he afterwards grants the vendor the right to repurchase, it is a new contract entered into by the purchaser as absolute owner.\u00a0 An option to buy or a promise to sell is different and distinct from the right of repurchase that must be reserved by means of stipulations to that effect in the contract of sale. [63]\n\nThere is no evidence on record that, on or before July 1985, petitioner agreed to sell her property to the respondent for P250,000.00. \u00a0Neither is there any documentary evidence showing that Ventura was authorized to offer for sale or sell the property for and in behalf of petitioner for P250,000.00, or to receive the said amount from respondent as purchase price of the property.\u00a0 The rule is that when a sale of a piece of land or any interest therein is through an agent, the authority of the latter shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void [64] and cannot produce any legal effect as to transfer the property from its lawful owner. [65] Being inexistent and void from the very beginning, said contract cannot be ratified. [66] Any contract entered into by Ventura for and in behalf of petitioner relative to the sale of the property is void and cannot be ratified by the latter. A void contract produces no effect either against or in favor of anyone. [67]\n\nRespondent also failed to prove that the negotiations between him and petitioner has culminated in his offer to buy the property for P250,000.00, and that they later on agreed to the sale of the property for the same amount.\u00a0 He likewise failed to prove that he purchased and reacquired the property in July 1985.\u00a0 The evidence on record shows that petitioner had offered to sell the property for US$15,000 on a \"take it or leave it\" basis in May 1984 upon the expiration of the Contract of Lease [68] -an offer that was rejected by respondent-which is why on December 30, 1997, petitioner and her husband offered again to sell the property to respondent for P670,000.00 inclusive of back rentals and the purchase price of the property under the April 13, 1982 Deed of absolute Sale. [69] The offer was again rejected by respondent.\u00a0 The final offer appears to have been made on January 11, 1998 [70] but again, like the previous negotiations, no contract was perfected between the parties.\n\nA contract is a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service. [71] Under Article 1318 of the New Civil Code, there is no contract unless the following requisites concur:\n\n(1) Consent of the contracting parties;\n(2) Object certain which is the subject matter of the contract;\n(3) Cause of the obligation which is established.\n\nContracts are perfected by mere consent manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. [72] Once perfected, they bind the contracting parties and the obligations arising therefrom have the form of law between the parties which must be complied with in good faith.\u00a0 The parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law. [73]\n\nThere was no contract of sale entered into by the parties based on the Receipts dated July 1985 and June 16, 1986, signed by Perlita Ventura and the letter of petitioner to respondent dated July 25, 1986.\n\nBy the contract of sale, one of the contracting parties obligates himself to transfer the ownership of and deliver a determinate thing and the other, to pay therefor a price certain in money or its equivalent. [74] The absence of any of the essential elements will negate the existence of a perfected contract of sale.\u00a0 As the Court ruled in Boston Bank of the Philippines v. Manalo: [75]\nA definite agreement as to the price is an essential element of a binding agreement to sell personal or real property because it seriously affects the rights and obligations of the parties.\u00a0 Price is an essential element in the formation of a binding and enforceable contract of sale.\u00a0 The fixing of the price can never be left to the decision of one of the contracting parties.\u00a0 But a price fixed by one of the contracting parties, if accepted by the other, gives rise to a perfected sale. [76]\nA contract of sale is consensual in nature and is perfected upon mere meeting of the minds.\u00a0 When there is merely an offer by one party without acceptance of the other, there is no contract. [77] When the contract of sale is not perfected, it cannot, as an independent source of obligation, serve as a binding juridical relation between the parties. [78]\n\nRespondent's reliance on petitioner's letter to him dated July 25, 1986 is misplaced.\u00a0 The letter reads in full:\n7-25-86\n\nDear Martin & Ising,\n\nEnclosed for your information is the letter written by my husband to Perlita. I hope that you will be able to convince your cousin that it's to her best interest to deposit the balance of your payment to me of P39,000.00 in my bank acct. per our agreement and send me my bank book right away so that we can transfer the title of the property.\n\nRegards,\nAmie [79]\nWe have carefully considered the letter of Perlita Ventura, dated July 18, 1986, and the letter of Eugene Roberts, dated July 25, 1986, where Ventura admitted having used the money of petitioner amounting to P39,000.00 without the latter's knowledge for the plane fare of Ventura's parents. Ventura promised to refund the amount of P39,000.00, inclusive of interests, within one year. [80] Eugene Roberts berated Ventura and called her a thief for stealing his and petitioner's money and that of respondent's wife, Ising, who allegedly told petitioner that she, Ising, loaned the money to her parents for their plane fare to the USA. \u00a0Neither Ventura nor Eugene Roberts declared in their letters that Ventura had used the P250,000.00 which respondent gave to her.\n\nPetitioner in her letter to respondent did not admit, either expressly or impliedly, having received P211,000.00 from Ventura. Moreover, in her letter to petitioner, only a week earlier, or on July 18, 1986, Ventura admitted having spent the P39,000.00 and pleaded that she be allowed to refund the amount within one (1) year, including interests.\nNaririto ang total ng pera mo sa bankbook mo, P55,000.00 pati na yong deposit na sarili mo at bale ang nagalaw ko diyan ay P39,000.00. Huwag kang mag-alala ibabalik ko rin sa iyo sa loob ng isang taon pati interest.\n\nAte Per [81]\nIt is incredible that Ventura was able to remit to petitioner P211,000.00 before July 25, 1986 when only a week earlier, she was pleading to petitioner for a period of one year within which to refund the P39,000.00 to petitioner.\n\nIt would have bolstered his cause if respondent had submitted an affidavit of Ventura stating that she had remitted P211,000.00 out of the P250,000.00 she received from respondent in July 1985 and June 20, 1986.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING , the petition is GRANTED .\u00a0 The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

OMBUDSMAN,RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N\nPHILIPPINE AGILA SATELLITE, INC. REPRESENTED BY MICHAEL C. U. DE GUZMAN,PETITIONER, VS. SEC. JOSEFINA TRINIDAD LICHAUCO AND THE HON. OMBUDSMAN,RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nOn June 6, 1994, a Memorandum of Understanding [1] (MOU) was entered into by a consortium of private telecommunications carriers and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) represented by then Secretary Jesus B. Garcia, Jr. relative to the launching, ownership, operation and management of a Philippine satellite by a Filipino-owned or controlled private consortium or corporation.\n\nPursuant to Article IV of the MOU, the consortium of private telecommunications carriers formed a corporation and adopted the corporate name Philippine Agila Satellite, Inc. (PASI), herein petitioner.\n\nBy letter [2] dated June 28, 1996, PASI president Rodrigo A. Silverio (Silverio) requested the then DOTC Secretary Amado S. Lagdameo, Jr. for official government confirmation of the assignment of Philippine orbital slots 161\"E and 153\"E to PASI for its AGILA satellites.\n\nIn response to Silverio's letter, Secretary Lagdameo, by letter [3] dated July 3, 1996, confirmed the government's assignment of Philippine orbital slots 161\"E and 153\"E to PASI for its AGILA satellites.\n\nPASI thereupon undertook preparations for the launching, operation and management of its satellites by, among other things, obtaining loans, increasing its capital, conducting negotiations with its business partners, and making an initial payment of US$ 3.5 million to Aerospatiale, a French satellite manufacturer.\n\nMichael de Guzman (de Guzman), PASI President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), later informed Jesli Lapuz (Lapuz), President and CEO of the Landbank of the Philippines, by letter [4] of December 3, 1996, of the government's assignment to PASI of orbital slots 161\"E and 153\"E and requested the bank's confirmation of its participation in a club loan in the amount of US$ 11 million, the proceeds of which would be applied to PASI's interim satellite.\n\nIt appears that Lapuz sent a copy of De Guzman's letter to then DOTC Undersecretary Josefina T. Lichauco, (Lichauco) who, by letter [5] of December 5, 1996, wrote Lapuz as follows:\nKindly be informed that there is simply no basis for Michael de Guzman to allege that the DOTC has assigned two (2) slots to PASI. He conveniently neglected to attach as another annex, in addition to Sec. Lagdameo's letter of 3 July 1996 (Annex \"A\") the letter of 28 June (Annex \"B\") in response to which the July 3rd letter had been sent to PASI. Annex \"B\" precisely provides that one slot (153\u00ba E, to which the interim satellite was supposed to migrate) was to be used for the migration of the Russian satellite in time for the APEC Leaders\" Summit. This particular endeavor was not successful. The interim satellite \"Gorizont\" never moved from its orbital location of 130\u00baE Longitude. Annex \"C\" is a letter from an official of the Subic Bay Satellite Systems Inc., with its attachments, addressed to me stating that as of the 13th of November, no such voyage to 153\u00baE orbital slot had been commenced. In fact DHI hid this fact from me, and in fact stated that Gorizont had already moved and was on its way to 153\u00baE.\nSince this timely migration did not happen in time for the APEC Leaders Meeting on 24 November, this 153\u00baE Longitude slot can no longer be assigned to PASI.\n\nThe other slot 161\u00baE Longitude is the one that can be made available for PASI's eventual launch, in 1998 most likely, in exchange for one free satellite transponder unit utilization, for all requirements of Government. These have yet to be embodied in a contract between PASI and the DOTC.\nI understand from my meeting with DHI/PASI this morning, and from the de Guzman letter you sent to me, that the latter are still interested in pursuing their \"interim satellite project\" and are applying for a loan with your bank. Of course they can always pursue this as a business venture of DHI/PASI which is their own corporate business decision. The DOTC supports this venture but they will be getting only one orbital slot for both the Interim Satellite Project and for the Launch Project. I understand from today's meeting with them that this is technically feasible.\n\nAs regards the use of the name \"Agila\", Mr. de Guzman's allegation that DHI/PASI has registered \"Agila\" as a \"corporate alias/trademark\" is FALSE . There is no such thing as registration of a \"corporate alias\". Nor for that matter can the trade name of a satellite be registered for just any satellite, where it was the President who chose the name for the first Philippine satellite in orbit. No one else coined that name but he. He has therefore given the name \"Agila I\" to the Mabuhay satellite now in orbit at 144\u00baE, being the first Philippine satellite in orbit. He made this announcement in the presence of all the APEC Heads of State just before the presentation to him of the Manila Action Plan for APEC. (Underscoring supplied) Lichauco subsequently issued, in December 1997, a Notice of Offer [6] for several orbital slots including 153\u00baE.\n\nPASI, claiming that the offer was without its knowledge and that it subsequently came to learn that another company whose identity had not been disclosed had submitted a bid and won the award for orbital slot 153\u00baE, filed on January 23, 1998 a complaint [7] before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mandaluyong City against Lichauco and the \"Unknown Awardee,\" for injunction to enjoin the award of orbital slot 153\u00baE, declare its nullity, and for damages.\n\nPASI also filed on February 23, 1998 a complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman against Secretary Josefina Trinidad Lichauco. In his affidavit-complaint, de Guzman charged Lichauco with gross violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, reading:\n(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of officers or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions. The complaint was docketed as OMB Case No. 0-98-0416. The Evaluation and Preliminary Investigation Bureau (EPIB) of the Office of the Ombudsman, by Evaluation Report [8] dated April 15, 1998, found the existence of a prejudicial question after considering that \"the case filed with the RTC involves facts intimately related to those upon which the criminal prosecution would be based and that the guilt or the innocence of the accused would necessarily be determined in the resolution of the issues raised in the civil case.\" It thus concluded that the filing of the complaint before the Ombudsman \"is premature since the issues involved herein are now subject of litigation in the case filed with the RTC,\" and accordingly recommended its dismissal. Then Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto approved on April 24, 1998 the recommendation of the EPIB.\n\nPASI moved to reconsider [9] the dismissal of the complaint, but was denied by Order [10] dated July 17, 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a motion to dismiss the civil case against respondent was denied by the trial court. On elevation of the order of denial to the Court of Appeals, said court, by Decision dated February 21, 2000, ordered the dismissal of the case. This Court, by Decision dated May 3, 2006, ordered the reinstatement of the case, however. [11]\n\nPASI is now before this Court via petition for review on certiorari, arguing that the Ombudsman erred in dismissing the complaint.\n\nIn issue are 1) whether there exists a prejudicial question and, if in the affirmative, 2) whether the dismissal of the complaint on that account is in order.\n\nSection 7, Rule 111 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure provides:\nSection 7. Elements of prejudicial question . - The elements of a prejudicial question are: (a) the previously instituted civil action involves an issue similar or intimately related to the issue raised in the subsequent criminal action, and (b) the resolution of such issue determines whether or not the criminal action may proceed. The rationale for the principle of prejudicial question is that although it does not conclusively resolve the guilt or innocence of the accused, it tests the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint or information in order to sustain the further prosecution of the criminal case. [12] Hence, the need for its prior resolution before further proceedings in the criminal action may be had.\n\nPASI concedes that the issues in the civil case are similar or intimately related to the issue raised in the criminal case. It contends, however, that the resolution of the issues in the civil case is not determinative of the guilt or innocence of Lichauco, it arguing that even if she is adjudged liable for damages, it does not necessarily follow that she would be convicted of the crime charged.\n\nTo determine the existence of a prejudicial question in the case before the Ombudsman, it is necessary to examine the elements of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 for which Lichauco was charged and the causes of action in the civil case.\n\nSection 3(e) of R.A. 3019 which was earlier quoted has the following elements:\nThe accused is a public officer discharging administrative or official functions or private persons charged in conspiracy with them;\n\nThe public officer committed the prohibited act during the performance of his official duty or in relation to his public position;\n\nThe public officer acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross, inexcusable negligence; and\n\nHis action caused undue injury to the Government or any private party, or gave any party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to such parties. [13] The civil case against Lichauco on the other hand involves three causes of action. The first, for injunction, seeks to enjoin the award of orbital slot 153\u00baE, the DOTC having previously assigned the same to PASI; the second, for declaration of nullity of award, seeks to nullify the award given to the undisclosed bidder for being beyond Lichauco's authority; and the third, for damages arising from Lichauco's questioned acts.\n\nIf the award to the undisclosed bidder of orbital slot 153\u00baE is, in the civil case, declared valid for being within Lichauco's scope of authority to thus free her from liability for damages, there would be no prohibited act to speak of nor would there be basis for undue injury claimed to have been suffered by petitioner. The finding by the Ombudsman of the existence of a prejudicial question is thus well-taken.\n\nRespecting the propriety of the dismissal by the Ombudsman of the complaint due to the pendency of a prejudicial question, PASI argues that since the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman is silent on the matter, the Rules of Court, specifically Section 6, Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, which now reads:\nSECTION 6. Suspension by reason of prejudicial question . - A petition for suspension of the criminal action based upon the pendency of a prejudicial question in a civil action may be filed in the office of the prosecutor or the court conducting the preliminary investigation. When the criminal action has been filed in court for trial, the petition to suspend shall be filed in the same criminal action at any time before the prosecution rests. (Underscoring supplied),\napplies in a suppletory character.\n\nThe Ombudsman, on the other hand, argues that the above-quoted provision of the Rules of Court applies to cases which are at the preliminary or trial stage and not to those, like the case subject of the present petition, at the evaluation stage.\n\nThe Ombudsman goes on to proffer that at the evaluation stage, the investigating officer may recommend any of several causes of action including dismissal of the complaint for want of palpable merit or subjecting the complaint to preliminary investigation, and the evaluation of the complaint involves the discretion of the investigating officer which this Court cannot interfere with.\n\nWhile the evaluation of a complaint involves the discretion of the investigating officer, its exercise should not be abused [14] or wanting in legal basis.\n\nRule II, Section 2 of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman reads:\nSECTION 2. Evaluation . - Upon evaluating the complaint, the investigating officer shall recommend whether it may be:\n\na) dismissed outright for want of palpable merit;\nb) referred to respondent for comment;\nc) indorsed to the proper government office or agency which has jurisdiction over the case;\nd) forwarded to the appropriate office or official for fact-finding investigation;\ne) referred for administrative adjudication; or\nf) subjected to a preliminary investigation. (Underscoring supplied) From the above-quoted provision, a complaint at the evaluation stage may be dismissed outright only for want of palpable merit. Want of palpable merit obviously means that there is no basis for the charge or charges. If the complaint has prima facie merit, however, the investigating officer shall recommend the adoption of any of the actions enumerated above from (b) to (f). [15]\n\nWhen, in the course of the actions taken by those to whom the complaint is endorsed or forwarded, a prejudicial question is found to be pending, Section 6, Rule 111 of the Rules of Court should be applied in a suppletory character. [16] As laid down in Yap v. Paras, [17] said rule directs that the proceedings may only be suspended , not dismissed, and that it may be made only upon petition , and not at the instance of the judge alone or as in this case, the investigating officer.\n\nTo give imprimatur to the Ombudsman's dismissal of petitioner's criminal complaint due to prejudicial question would not only run counter to the provision of Section 6 of Rule 111 of the Rules of Court. It would sanction the extinguishment of criminal liability, if there be any, through prescription under Article 89 vis a vis Articles 90 and 91 of the Revised Penal Code which respectively read:\nART. 89. How criminal liability is totally extinguished . - Criminal liability is totally extinguished:\nBy the death of the convict, as to the personal penalties; and as to pecuniary penalties, liability therefore is extinguished only when the death of the offender occurs before final judgment; By service of the sentence; By amnesty, which completely extinguishes the penalty and all its effects; By absolute pardon; By prescription of the crime; By prescription of the penalty; By the marriage of the offended woman, as provided in Article 344 of this Code. (Underscoring supplied)\nART. 90. Prescription of crimes. - Crimes punishable by death, reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal shall prescribe in twenty years.\n\nCrimes punishable by other afflictive penalties shall prescribe in fifteen years.\n\nThose punishable by a correctional penalty shall prescribe in ten years; with the exception of those punishable by arresto mayor, which shall prescribe in five years.\n\nThe crime of libel or other similar offenses shall prescribe in one year.\n\nThe offenses of oral defamation and slander by deed shall prescribe in six months.\n\nLight offenses prescribe in two months.\n\nWhen the penalty fixed by law is a compound one, the highest penalty shall be made the basis of the application of the rules contained in the first, second, and third paragraphs of this article. x x x\n\nART. 91. Computation of prescription of offenses . - The period of prescription shall commence to run from the day on which the crime is discovered by the offended party, the authorities, or their agents, and shall be interrupted by the filing of the complaint or information, and shall commence to run again when such proceedings terminate without the accused being convicted or acquitted, or are unjustifiably stopped for any reason not imputable to him.\n\nx x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nWHEREFORE, the Order dated July 17, 1998 of respondent Ombudsman dismissing OMB Case No. 0-98-0416 against respondent then Secretary Josefina Trinidad Lichauco is SET ASIDE.\n\nThe Ombudsman is ORDERED to REINSTATE to its docket for further proceedings, in line with the foregoing ratiocination, OMB Case No. 0-98-0416.\n\nSO ORDERED\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairman), Carpio, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur\n\n[1] Ombudsman records, pp. 9-15.\n\n[2] Id. at 16.\n\n[3] Id. at 17.\n\n[4] Id. at 18-22.\n\n[5] Id. at 31-32.\n\n[6] Id. at 38-40.\n\n[7] Id. at 41-50.\n\n[8] Id. at 55-56.\n\n[9] Id. at 57-63.\n\n[10] Id. at 67-69.\n\n[11] Philippine Agila Satellite Inc. and Michael C.

CAUGMA, AMIANA ABELLA AND ROSAURO MARTINEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE SANDIGANBAYAN,RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of the Decision [1] of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 17001 convicting the four accused therein of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as well as its Resolution [2] denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.\n\nUnder Executive Order (E.O.) No. 888 dated March 18, 1983, ministers and heads of government agencies were authorized to dispose of their unserviceable equipment and disposable property through the creation of a Disposal Committee (Committee) composed of a representative of the owning ministry or agency as chairperson, and, as members, representatives of the Bureau of Supply Coordination and the Commission on Audit (COA). The committee had the following functions:\n(1) Inspect or authorize the field officer to inspect the unserviceable equipment and property to verify justification for disposal;\n\n(2) Set the final appraised value of all disposable property considering obsolescence, market demand, physical condition and result of previous biddings for similar property;\n\n(3) Recommend to the Minister or Head of Ministry/Agency for approval the manner of disposal taking into consideration the pertinent provisions of the Revised Administrative Code and the National Auditing Code;\n\n(4) Conduct public biddings for the sale or disposable property on an \"AS IS,\" \"WHERE IS\" basis and to recommend the corresponding award;\n\n(5) The representatives of the Commission on Audit and the Bureau of Supply Coordination together with the COA Technical Staff specifically assigned to the Disposal Committee, shall be clothed with full authority to make final decisions in behalf of their respective offices in the various committee deliberations;\n\n(6) In the case of agencies attached to certain Ministries, recommendations of the Disposal Committee is subject to the final approval of the Minister concerned. [3]\nE.O. No. 888 also provided that the unserviceable equipment may be disposed of by sale through public bidding and that their appraised value (as determined by the Committee) shall be the minimum selling price. Should the sale through public bidding be unsuccessful, the Committee was authorized to dispose of the property in any manner deemed advantageous to the government, including through barter or negotiated sale at no less than the Committee's appraised value.\n\nPursuant to E.O. No. 888, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) created its own committee under Office Order No. 65 dated May 8, 1983. Among the committee members were Marietta T. Caugma, Chief of the Finance Division as chairperson; Amiana M. Abella, vice-chairperson; Rosauro M. Martinez, BFAR Representative as member; Villa J. Bernaldo, COA Auditor/Representative as member; and Meynardo Geralde, Jr., Supply Coordination Office representative, as member.\n\nWay back in December 1959, the BFAR had acquired eight vessels from Japan under the RP-Japan Reparation Commission Agreement, among them the \" M/V Malasugui.\" In 1974 to 1980, the deteriorating vessel was dry-docked for extensive repairs, and thereafter was no longer utilized for test fishing activities. [4]\n\nThus, in a Comment Slip [5] dated April 18, 1984, Arsenio S. De Jesus, Chief of the Technological Services Division, informed BFAR Director Felix R. Gonzales that it was time to \"condemn the vessel due to old age (27 years).\"\n\nOn July 18, 1984, the vessel sustained leaks on her forward hull while docked at Pier 4, Fishing Port, Navotas, Metro Manila, flooding the engine room, fish holder and gear locker rooms. The BFAR engaged the services of V/L Shipyard Corporation (Corporation) to tow the vessel from the Navotas pier.\n\nThe Corporation billed the BFAR for berthing fees at P110.90 a day from September 11, 1984 to December 31, 1984 in the total amount of P12,420.00, [6] and for security services, tonnage, electrical power for water supply, gasoline and other vessel services in the amount of P21,037.00, or the total amount of P33,457.80 via Bill No. 1529 [7] dated January 3, 1985. Gonzales approved the claim and Caugma certified the availability of funds for the disbursement via Disbursement Voucher [8] dated January 28, 1985, subject to release of funds from the Ministry of Budget and Management.\n\nIn a Memorandum [9] dated July 20, 1984, Officer-in-Charge Eriberto A. Macatangay of the Fishing Boat Operations Section recommended to the Bureau Director that the vessel should be disposed of considering that it could no longer serve its purpose due to \"old age and deteriorating superstructure.\" In a Memorandum [10] dated November 13, 1984, the captain of the vessel also recommended that the vessel be disposed/condemned to save funds which would have to be spent for repair and berthing fees. An Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property [11] was prepared, declaring that the vessel was obsolete, \"junk or scrap,\" and that to maintain it was no longer economical. The report was signed by the Bureau Director, a COA representative and Arsenio S. De Jesus, Chief, Technological Services Division. The report was transmitted to the Director of the Supply Coordination Office of the General Services Administration (GSA) for appropriate action. [12]\n\nIn a Memorandum [13] dated April 29, 1985 signed by De Jesus, COA representative Jaoquin C. Lim and Supply Coordination Office representative Meynardo L. Garalde, Jr. it was reported to the GSA that the fishing vessel was obsolete, unserviceable and beyond economical repair, and that spare parts were no longer available. The appraised value of the vessel was declared at P86,917.60. It was recommended that the vessel be sold through public bidding for not lower than P86,000.00; that in addition, the awardee/buyer shall pay all the charges in connection with the sale of the property; and that the vessel be disposed immediately to avoid further depreciation in value, \"considering that it [was] berthed/docked in a private firm.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on November 8, 1985, the Corporation billed the BFAR for berthing fees at P110.90 a day from January 1, 1985 to October 31, 1985 totaling P33,457.80; and for security services, electrical power, shifting of vessel with the use of a tugboat, fresh water supply and gasoline, and other services amounting to P25,940.00. The total charges amounted to P69,653.60. [14]\n\nOn November 11, 1985, the Disposal Committee submitted its Report [15] on the appraisal of the vessel, recommending that it be sold at public auction at the appraised value of P86,917.60, including the charges of the sale. The Committee also prepared the Procedural Guidelines [16] to be followed relative to the sale. These were transmitted to Bureau Director Gonzales on November 11, 1985. [17]\n\nOn November 12, 1985, Gonzales issued an Invitation to Bid [18] which also contained the conditions of the sale of the vessel. He revised the proposed procedural guidelines of the Committee (Condition No. 8 of the Invitation to Bid) to provide that the \" bidder agrees to pay, in addition to the award price, taxes, duties and other costs such as berthing fees, cost of publication of the bid, etc. and levies which may be imposed by law. \" [19] Prospective bidders were required to submit their sealed bids not later than 10:00 a.m. on November 21, 1985, at which time the bids would be opened publicly as required by Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. The bid offer was also required to be accompanied by cash or manager's check in an amount equivalent to 10% percent of the offer to guarantee the bid, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the sale, and later converted as downpayment in case of a winning bidder. Bids which did not meet the full consideration or requirements of the BFAR would be considered defective, and only those deemed advantageous to the government would be accepted. The sale of the vessel would be awarded to the highest bidder who would pay the bid price within 10 days from notice of the award.\n\nThe invitation to bid was published in the Times Journal for three consecutive days from November 14 to 15, 1985. [20] The publisher billed the BFAR P2,400.00 as publication fee on November 16, 1985. [21]\n\nThe public bidding was held on November 21, 1985. [22] There were four bidders but only two participated: Dr. Enrique Peras, Jr. for the All Point Trading and General Services Corporation, and Eddie S. Galler, Jr., General Manager of the Corporation. Galler, Jr. submitted the bid, as well as copies of Invoice Nos. 1529 and 1589 showing that the Corporation had billed the Bureau the total amount of P103,111.40 for various services rendered on the vessel. Dr. Peras, Jr. inquired what were included as \"berthing fees\" under Condition No. 8 in the invitation to bid, and Caugma replied that the fees included those due after the publication of the invitation to bid up to the final award of the sale of the vessel. [23] Galler, Jr. asked if the P103,111.40 under Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589 issued by the Corporation would be included in the bid price, and Caugma replied that the Committee would study the matter. [24] At that time, the Committee had no knowledge of the berthing fees and other charges incurred from November 1, 1985 up to the final award. [25]\n\nThe Committee, however, agreed that the bid for the vessel should be stated separately from berthing and publication fees which should be broken down. [26] Galler, Jr. withdrew the bid of the Corporation. The Committee resolved to reset the opening of the bids at 10:00 a.m. of November 28, 1985. Upon the suggestion of Bernaldo, the notice of public bidding was posted in public places. [27]\n\nOn November 28, 1985, the Committee met for the re-scheduled public bidding. Bernaldo was substituted by Marlene Nacua of the COA. There were five registered bidders but only two appeared. The Corporation submitted its sealed bid - P13,890.00 or 10% of its bid price as required by the invitation to bid. The other registered bidders left without submitting any bid.\n\nCaugma asked the committee members if the lone bid of the Corporation could already be opened and they all agreed. Nacua did not interpose any objection because she believed in good faith that it was in accordance with COA rules and regulations. Caugma opened the bid and receipted the P13,890.00 representing 10% of the bid price of P138,900.00, broken down as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\na) | PUBLICATION FEE | P 2,400.00\nb) | BERTHING FEE | 103,111.40\nc) | BFAR | 33,388.60\n | Total | P138,900.00[28]\n[END_TABLE]\n\na) PUBLICATION FEE P 2,400.00 b) BERTHING FEE 103,111.40 c) BFAR 33,388.60\nTotal P138,900.00 [28]\nBelieving that the bid price for the vessel was P138,900.00 and that this amount surpassed the appraised value of P86,917.60, the Committee members resolved to recommend to the Bureau Director that the sale of the vessel be awarded to the Corporation for final approval. The Committee transmitted its recommendation to the Bureau Director, including the minutes of the meeting. Upon the suggestion of Amiana Abella, the Committee sent a letter to the corporation confirming that its bill for costs and berthing fees would be the last it would receive. [29]\n\nMeanwhile, Gonzales approved Disbursement Voucher No. 101-85-12-19-9042 [30] dated December 5, 1985 amounting to P69,653.60 in favor the Corporation. Caugma certified that the amount was available for the purpose, but payment was held in abeyance pending the release of the final award to be made by the Ministry of Budget and Management.\n\nOn December 23, 1985, Gonzales transmitted a letter [31] to the Minister of Agriculture and Food requesting for authority to award the sale of the \" M/V Malasugui \" to the Corporation. He stated that of the five registered bidders, only the Corporation had submitted its bid of P138,900.00, which included the cost of publication, berthing fees, and the appraised value of the vessel. He appended to the letter the lone Minutes of the Public Bidding held on November 28, 1985 as well as the submitted bid. The Assistant Minister, Aurora B. Marcos, referred the matter to the Resident Auditor for study and recommendation. [32] Then Ministry Auditor Reynaldo Ventura informed the Minister that he had no objection to award to the Corporation the sale of the fishing vessel, considering that the bid it submitted was higher than the appraised value. [33] He required, however, that the proposed sale be given wide publication, and that the proceeds of the sale be accounted for as income and be remitted to the National Treasury.\n\nIn light of this favorable report, the Minister of Agriculture and Food, through Assistant Minister Marcos, authorized the Bureau Director to award and sell the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00, pursuant to Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445, and Section 3, paragraph 3 of E.O. No. 888. [34]\n\nMeanwhile, on January 6, 1986, the BFAR remitted to the Corporation the amount of P69,653.60 in payment of Bill No. 1589. Galler, Jr. issued Receipt No. 256 for the said amount. [35]\n\nOn February 10, 1986, the BFAR, through Gonzales, awarded the sale of the \" M/V Malasugui\" to the Corporation and requested it to remit the amount of P138,900.00 in payment thereof. [36] The BFAR delivered juridical possession of the vessel to the Corporation on February 27, 1986. [37] On February 28, 1986, the Corporation remitted P138,900.00 as full payment of the vessel for which it was issued Official Receipt No. 2861007. [38] The amount was deposited in the National Treasury on March 5, 1986. [39] Thereafter, the BFAR released to the Corporation its bid bond of P13,890.00.\n\nOn April 25, 1986, Caugma approved the change of entry in the book of accounts of the BFAR and credited P138,900.00 to it. [40]\n\nHowever, on May 5, 1986, Antonio B. Baltazar, a former BFAR Chief Technologist who was separated from government service on September 19, 1975, filed a Complaint-Affidavit [41] with the Ombudsman against Director Felix Gonzales for negligence under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code on July 17, 1984 for the leaks of the vessel while berthed at Navotas, Metro Manila. Baltazar claimed, among others, that Gonzales had failed to file an insurance claim on the vessel from the Government Service Insurance System. The matter was referred to the COA.\n\nMeanwhile, on May 12, 1986, the National Treasurer remitted P33,457.80 to the Corporation [42] as full payment for berthing fees and other services per Invoice No. 1529 and Disbursement Voucher dated January 28, 1985. [43]\n\nOn June 5, 1986, the Regional Director of the COA directed Villa Bernaldo (then BFAR Auditor) to conduct a discreet inquiry regarding Baltazar's complaint. [44] Bernaldo submitted her report on June 18, 1986, where she declared that the Corporation submitted its P138,900.00 bid, broken down as follows: publication fee, P2,400.00; berthing fee, P103,111.40; charges on the BFAR, P33,388.60; or a total of P138,900.00. [45] According to Bernaldo, the berthing fee represented the amount BFAR billed the Corporation for dry-docking costs, and that this expense was included as one of the findings in the 1985 Annual Audit Report of the BFAR because it was incurred mainly due to the delay in the disposal of the \" M/V Malasugui .\" She concluded that the appraised value of P86,917.60 was therefore, not met, but the fees incurred in connection with the disposal were included in the bid offer of P138,900.00 and was accepted by the Bureau. She admitted, however, that the amount of P138,900.00 had been fully accounted for, receipted under O.R. No. 2861007 dated March 4, 1986 and deposited as income in the National Treasury on March 5, 1986 . [46]\n\nBaltazar thereafter filed a Manifestation [47] with the Ombudsman requesting the inclusion of Caugma, Abella, Bernaldo, and Martinez as respondents.\n\nThe Ombusman required the Committee members to submit their counter-affidavits. In their Joint Counter-Affidavit and Rejoinder Affidavit, [48] they declared inter alia that the bidding and sale of the vessel was made in accordance with law, as well as accounting and auditing rules and regulations. After the requisite preliminary investigation, Special Prosecution Officer Robert E. Kallos issued a Resolution [49] dated July 24, 1992, recommending that the charges against Gonzales and Bernaldo be dropped; Gonzales acted in good faith, while Bernaldo was not present when the actual bidding was conducted.\n\nThereafter, the Ombudsman filed an Information charging Eddie S. Galler, Jr., Marietta Caugma, Amiana Abella and Rosauro Martinez of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The accusatory portion of the information reads:\nThat in or about and during the period from November 21, 1985 to November 28, 1985 and/or prior or subsequent thereto in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Marietta T. Caugma, Amiana Abella and Rosauro Martinez, all public officers being then the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and member respectively, of the Disposal Committee of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), while in the discharge/exercise of their official administrative functions conspiring and confederating with accused EDUARDO S. GALLER, JR., a private individual and representative of V.L. Shipyard of Navotas, did then and there willfully and unlawfully through evident bad faith cause undue injury to the BFAR/Government by then and there proceeding with a public bidding for the disposal of BFAR' fishing vessel M/V Malasugui held on November 28, 1985 when only EDDIE S. GALLER, JR. was present and submitted his bid and thereafter accused public officers acted favorably on the itemized bid offer of EDDIE S. GALLER, JR. in spite of their knowledge that said bid offer is in violation of condition no. 8 of the Invitation to Bid and that the BFAR/Government will only get the amount of THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT PESOS AND SIXTY CENTAVOS (P33,388.60), Philippines (sic) Currency, which is very much below the Appraised value of M/V Malasugui in the amount of P86,917.60, thereby causing damage or injury to the BFAR/Government in the sum of P53,529.00.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [50]\nOn reinvestigation, the Ombudsman denied the recommendation of Special Prosecutor Reynaldo A. Alhambra to withdraw the Information for being unsupported by evidence. [51]\n\nTo prove the guilt of all the accused, the prosecution relied on the testimony of the BFAR Resident Auditors Bernaldo and Nacua. Bernaldo declared that she was present during the initial public bidding on November 21, 1985. However, during the public bidding on November 28, 1985, the COA was represented by Nacua. She claimed that the second bidding should not have proceeded because the lone bidder offered to purchase the vessel for only P33,388.60 instead of its appraised value as required by Section 6, paragraph 1 of E.O. No. 888. [52] She further declared that to comply with E.O. No. 888, the minimum acceptable selling price was P190,000.00 broken down as follows: P2,400.00 for publication fee; berthing fee of P103,111.40; and P86,917.60 for the appraised value of the vessel. [53] Considering that this bid price was not reached after the second bid, the Committee should have declared a failure of bid, hence, per COA regulations, the vessel should have been sold through negotiation for a price to be fixed by the Commission. [54]\n\nIn response to the clarificatory question of the Presiding Justice, Bernaldo declared that the transactions relative to the sale of the vessel were in order. [55] She also affirmed the contents of petitioners' Joint Affidavit and Rejoinder Joint Affidavit. Nacua, for her part, declared that the public auction/bidding was done in accordance with pertinent laws and COA rules and regulations.\n\nCaugma adduced testimonial and documentary evidence that as early as January 3, 1985, the Corporation had billed the BFAR for services rendered on the vessel after the July 18, 1984 incident, per Invoice No. 1529 for the amount of P33,457.80. The BFAR prepared and issued a Disbursement Voucher on January 28, 1985. [56] The funding of the disbursement was released by the Ministry (now Department) of Budget and Management only on March 4, 1986 under CDC B-0141-86-1-022. The Treasurer of the Philippines paid the amount to the Corporation on May 12, 1986, per PNB Check No. SN-5-7994745-4 for P33,457.00. [57] She clarified that the P69,653.60 paid to the Corporation per Invoice Receipt No. 1589 dated November 8, 1985 was for mooring and berthing services, as well as part of the security services at the water front, electric supply, tug services from January 1, 1985 up to October 31, 1985, and other services provided to the vessel from January 1, 1985 to September 15, 1985. The payment of these bills to the Corporation was approved by no less than Villa Bernaldo, BFAR resident auditor. [58] The two obligations of the BFAR totaling P103,111.40 were separate and valid obligations of BFAR which should not have been deducted from the proceeds of the sale to the winning bidder. [59]\n\nCaugma further declared that on November 21, 1985, she explained to Galler, Jr. and Dr. Peras that the berthing fees referred to in the Invitation to Bid were those due from the publication of the Invitation to Bid up to the final award. The berthing fees from January 1, 1984 to October 31, 1985 were not for the account of the bidder. When she asked Galler, Jr. if the Corporation was waiving the publication fees and berthing fees from the time the invitation to bid was published up to the final award, Galler, Jr. agreed.\n\nGaller, Jr. adopted the evidence of Caugma. He testified that he was the Marketing Manager of the Corporation, and that he had not met the Committee members before the public bidding on November 21, 1985. [60] At that time, the purchase price of the vessel had not yet been fixed. [61] He presented the two bills of the Corporation - one for services, and another for berthing fees up to October 31, 1985 totaling P103,111.40. At the time, the Corporation had not yet presented its bill for berthing fees and various services from November 13, 1985 to November 21, 1985. His impression was that since the vessel was being sold on an \"as is where is\" basis, the other charges were not part of the bid and had to be separately paid. As far as he knew, the only interest of the BFAR was to recover the value of the vessel. [62] He waived the berthing fees due from the publication of the Invitation to Bid until the final award. [63] On November 28, 1985, he submitted the sealed bid of the Corporation which he signed upon the request of the Corporation's president. [64] The net bid price of the Corporation for the vessel was P138,900.00, [65] but he could not recall whether this bid had been broken down because it was prepared by one of the staff, which he signed before submission to the Committee. The amount of P103,111.40 in his bid included the berthing fees of P46,000.00 and for miscellaneous services for the vessel. [66] He felt that the P103,111.40, the amount the BFAR owed the Corporation for services rendered on the vessel, was a reasonable price, but the Corporation still submitted its bid to purchase it for P138,900.00 because it could repair the vessel at the least price. [67]\n\nOn July 29, 2004, the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment [68] convicting the four (4) accused of the crime charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Marietta T. Caugma, Amiana Abella, Rosauro Martinez and Eduardo S. Galler, Jr., GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019 and are hereby sentenced to each suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum to fifteen (15) years as maximum and to each suffer the penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office.\n\nSO ORDERED . [69]\nThe Sandiganbayan ruled that, under Condition No. 8 of the invitation to bid, only those bidders who had agreed to pay no less than the appraised value of the vessel, P86,917.60, excluding taxes, duties and other costs (such as berthing fees, publication of the bid and levies which may be imposed by law), should have been considered by the Committee. Caugma was aware of this condition in the invitation to bid, as evidenced by the minutes of the bidding held on November 21, 1985. She even explained the conditions of the sale to the bidders then present. The Sandiganbayan further declared that Caugma had knowledge of the fact that the berthing fee was P103,111.40 since it was clearly indicated in the invitation to bid. Thus, in evident bad faith, the accused conspired together and awarded the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00, of which only P33,388.60 would be remitted to the BFAR. It also held that Committee members Abella and\n\nMartinez took active part in the public bidding and, as evidenced by the Minutes of the Meeting, favored the Corporation.\n\nThe Sandiganbayan concluded that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Disposal Committee gave unwarranted advantage and preference to Galler, Jr., causing injury to the government to the extent of P53,529.00; after deducting the publication fee of P2,400.00 and the berthing fee of P103,111.40, the government realized only the net amount of P33,388.60, short by P53,529.00 of the appraisal value of the vessel, P86,917.60.\n\nPetitioners moved for the reconsideration of the decision, which the graft court denied on January 26, 2005. [70]\n\nHence, petitioners filed the instant petition seeking the reversal of the Sandiganbayan's ruling on the following claims: (1) they were denied their right to equal protection of the law; and (2) the prosecution failed to prove that they acted in evident bad faith in awarding the sale of the vessel to the Corporation and that the BFAR suffered damage/injury in the amount of P53,529.00.\n\nPetitioners aver that the Committee complied with the requirements of E.O. No. 888 and of Fisheries Order No. 65, Series of 1983 relative to the sale of the fishing vessel. They maintain that their recommendation to accept the subject bid was in order, as even the BFAR Director concurred therein and transmitted a letter-request to the Minister of Agriculture and Food for authority to award the sale to the lone bidder; in turn, the Ministry Auditor interposed no objection as the said bid was higher than the vessel's appraised value. Petitioners point out that no less than the Assistant Minister concurred with the Resident Auditor to the Committee's recommendation.\n\nPetitioners likewise posit that the conditions set forth in the invitation to bid were complied with. They maintain that the Committee's determination of the award is merely recommendatory and is not in itself a contract. Thus, the BFAR Director and the Assistant Minister should be charged and prosecuted for violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 considering that under E.O. No. 888, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food has the sole authority to dispose of the vessel. They point out that ultimately, it was the Ministry that sold the vessel to the Corporation. Since the BFAR Director and the Minister were not prosecuted, they (petitioners) should not have been charged and prosecuted for the sale of the vessel to the Corporation, otherwise their right to the equal protection of the law would be violated.\n\nPetitioners further aver that the prosecution failed to prove that they acted in evident bad faith and that the government sustained undue injury. They insist that the bid price of the fishing vessel was P138,900.00, not merely P33,388.60. Petitioners aver that this can be gleaned from the testimony of Bernaldo and Galler, Jr. The costs referred to in Condition No. 8 of the Condition of Sale pertained to all charges in connection with the sale of the vessel and were to be paid by the bidder, not as part of but in addition to the bid price of P138,900.00. The fact that BFAR owed to the Corporation has no relevance to the public bidding, as the obligation of BFAR in the amount of P103,111.40 is separate and distinct from the Corporation's bid of P138,900.00. Petitioners point out that the amount of P138,900.00 was paid to the national treasury. Even assuming that the government sustained a loss of P53,529.00, they should not be the ones held liable therefor.\n\nThe Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), for its part, avers that petitioners' contention that their role in the public bidding was recommendatory in nature is baseless; such argument was proffered in order to evade responsibility for the unjust and disadvantageous sale which prejudiced the interest of the government. The subsequent issuance by the BFAR Director of the certificate of award to the winning bidder is only a formality. What consummates the sale is the Committee's declaration of the winning bidder. When a qualified bidder is declared as such, it follows that such winning bidder will be awarded the contract or certificate of award; otherwise, taking part in the said bidding would be a meaningless exercise.\n\nThe OSP maintains that when the subject fishing vessel was advertised for sale, the act of selling the property had begun as there was already an offer. After complying with the requirements on publication and invitation to bid, the Committee proceeded with the sale and the Corporation was declared the winning bidder. The contract was perfected at that moment, as there was already a meeting of the minds between the seller and the buyer. The Bureau Director's subsequent issuance of the Certificate of Award did not affect the contract which had already been perfected and consummated in the first place through the Committee's actuations. Besides, the OSP asserts, the corresponding certificate of award would not have been issued had not the Committee declared the Corporation as the winning bidder. Thus, it was the Committee that conducted the sale and subsequently disposed of the fishing vessel in favor of said Corporation.\n\nAccording to the OSP, \"what is certain is that the public bidding was in fact a feigned, orchestrated and bogus one designed to prejudice the government, and this was known to petitioners before the bidding started.\" It argued further argued that:\nThe appraised value of M/V Malasugui was P86,917.60 as reported to by the Disposal Committee. V/L Shipyard Corporation offered a bid in the amount of P133,900.00 (sic). In its application, V/L Shipyard broke down the items to constitute the amount of P133,900.00 (sic) as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nPublication fee | P 2,400.00\nBerthing fee | 103,111.40\nBFAR | 33,388.60\n[END_TABLE]\n\nPublication fee P 2,400.00 Berthing fee 103,111.40 BFAR 33,388.60\nWhen the Disposal Committee published its Invitation to Bid, it was specific in one of its condition that \" \"(t)he bidder agrees to pay in addition to the award, price, taxes, duties and other costs such as berthing fees, cost of publication of the bid, etc. and levies which may be imposed by law.\"\n\nIt was a matter of fact that BFAR owed V/L Shipyard Corporation an amount of P103,111.40, as berthing fee, for [dry-docking] M/V Malasugui at its property. After deducting the said amount together with P2,400.00 for the cost of the publication of the bid from the bid proposal in the amount of P138,900.00, the amount of P33,388.60 was arrived at. And this amount of P33,388.60 will go to BFAR as itemized by V/L Shipyard ahead when it posted its bid for M/V Malasugui. To reiterate, the bid proposal of V/L Shipyard was included in the Invitation to Bid of BFAR. Clearly, the government lost an amount of P53,529.00. x x x\n\nxxxx\n\nIn reality what was paid by V/L Shipyard Corporation for M/V Malasugui to BFAR was only P33,388.60, short of P53,529.00 from the appraised value of P86,917.60. The damage cost to the government was not merely negligible but more than substantial.\n\nFrom the foregoing, all the elements of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019 were present, and thus, the conviction of all the petitioners, together with Eddie Galler, Jr. is correct. [71]\nIn their Reply, petitioners reiterate that their determination as Committee members was merely recommendatory and subject to the final approval of the Minister of Agriculture and Food as provided in Section 6 of E.O. No. 888.\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nUnder the Constitution, accusation is not synonymous with guilt. In a criminal case, the accused is presumed innocent. It is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused for the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt. His freedom is forfeited only if the requisite quantum of proof necessary for conviction exists. The accused is even obliged to offer evidence in his behalf. The proof against him must survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to become a summary judgment. The conscience must be satisfied that on the accused could be laid the responsibility for the offense charged in that not only did he perpetrate the act but that it amounted to a crime. It is required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into account. [72] Thus, the burden of proof never shifts to the accused .\n\nSection 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 provides:\n(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.\n\nThe essential elements of violation of the provision are as follows:\nThe accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions;\n\nHe must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or inexcusable negligence; and\n\nThat his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions. [73] It must be stressed that mere bad faith is not enough for one to be liable under the law, since the act of bad faith must in the first place be evident. [74] Elaborating on the meaning of evident bad faith, this Court held in Marcelo v. Sandiganbayan : [75]\nBad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud. ( Spiegel v. Beacon Participations, 8 NE 2 nd Series, 895, 1007). It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill will for ulterior purposes. ( Air France v. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155, 166-167). Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage.\nUndue injury has been interpreted as synonymous to actual damages which is akin to that in civil law. [76 The prosecution is burdened to prove the factual basis and amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable by the injured party. [77] Courts cannot simply rely on speculations, conjectures or guesswork in determining the fact and the amount of damages. [78]\n\nConspiracy or collusion by and among public officers, inter se, and via private individuals to commit the crime under Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 must likewise be proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. This was the ruling of the Court in Desierto v. Ocampo : [79]\nCollusion implies a secret understanding whereby one party plays into another's hands for fraudulent purposes. It may take place between and every contractor resulting in no competition, in which case, the government may declare a failure of bidding. Collusion may also ensue between contractors and the chairman and members of the PBAC to simulate or rig the bidding process, thus insuring the award to a favored bidder, to the prejudice of the government agency and public service. For such acts of the chairman and the members of the PBAC, they may be held administratively liable for conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the government service. Collusion by and among the members of the PBAC and/or contractors submitting their bids may be determined from their collective acts or omissions before, during and after the bidding process. The complainants are burdened to prove such collusion by clear and convincing evidence because if so proved, the responsible officials may be dismissed from the government service or meted severe administrative sanctions for dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the government service.\nTo prove the guilt of petitioners for the crime charged, the prosecution presented COA Auditors Nacua and Bernaldo, and the report prepared by the latter dated June 18, 1986. However, contrary to petitioners' stance, the collective testimonies of the witnesses tend to exculpate petitioners.\n\nIn her Report, Bernaldo declared that the Corporation's bid for the vessel was only P33,388.60, P53,529.00 short of the threshold minimum price of P86,917.60, as provided in Condition No. 8 of the Invitation to Bid:\n8. That the bidder agrees to pay in addition to the award price, taxes, duties and other costs such as berthing fees, cost of publication of the bid, etc. and levies which may be imposed by law. [80]\nBernaldo testified that the Corporation's bid indicated the amount of P103,111.40, its claim for berthing fees and for various services rendered for the vessel from September 11, 1984 to October 31, 1985 under Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589, and that such expenses should be deducted from its bid of P138,900.00. She maintained that a qualified bidder should have submitted a bid not lower than P192,529.60. Bernaldo concluded that the Corporation submitted a bid of only P33,388.00, P53,529.00 short of a threshold minimum bid for the vessel; hence, the government lost P53,529.00 in the sale of the vessel. However, in the Joint Affidavit [81] submitted to the Ombudsman, petitioners, including Bernaldo, categorically declared that the bid price of the Corporation was P138,900.00, and that such bid was higher than the appraised value of the vessel amounting to P86,917.60. Bernaldo declared that the P138,900.00 was fully accounted for under O.R. No. 2861007 dated March 4, 1986, and deposited as income in the national treasury on March 5, 1986. Petitioners and Bernaldo maintained that the sale of the vessel was made in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations of the government . Bernaldo was as adamant as petitioners when they declared in their Rejoinder Joint Affidavit [82] submitted to the Ombudsman that the disposition of the vessel was made strictly in accordance with the law, rules and regulations of the government on the disposition of government property:\n6. That the obligations under Bill No. 1529 in the amount of P33,457.00 dated January 3, 1985 for services rendered in 1984 by the [V/L] Shipyard Corporation, was noted and approved for payment by the Bureau Resident Auditor and requested for the revalidation by the Bureau with the Department of Budget and Management and a corresponding funding was released by the said Department of Budget and Management under CDC No. B-0141-86-1-022 dated March 4, 1986.\n\nThe obligation under Bill No. 1589 dated November 8, 1985 in the amount of P69,653.60 were services rendered by the [V/L] Shipyard Corporation in the form of mooring on berthing fee, including share on security services at water front, supply of electrical power and four units light bulbs during night time, from January 1, 1985 up to October 31, 1985; tug service; supplied vessel's crew with freshwater requirements on board from January 1, 1985 up to October 31, 1985 and provided vessel with one (1) set gasoline driven 3\" diameter centrifugal water pump, and supplied gasoline, oil operator and mechanics from January 1, 1985 to September 15, 1985. That the said obligation under Obligation No. 409-102-12-412-85 was approved and concurred by the Bureau Auditor of the Commission on Audit.\n\nThus, the two obligations (Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589 in the total amount of P103,111.40 of the Bureau with the [V/L] Shipyard Corporation were for services rendered and therefore, separate and distinct valid obligations of the Bureau to the Corporation. The two obligations were pre-audited by the Bureau Auditor before payments were made by the Bureau. The payment of P103,111.40, therefore, for the berthing fees and other services rendered by [V/L] Shipyard Corporation was made in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations and therefore should not be added nor deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the vessel. Xerox copies of the Requests for Obligation of Allotment for [V/L] Shipyard Corporation in the amount of P33,457.00 and P69, 653.50, for various services rendered for RPS Malasugui in 1984 and 1985 as noted and approved by the Bureau Auditor of the Commission on Audit before payment can be made by the Bureau as Annexes 8 and 9[,] respectively. Xerox copies of the two vouchers for P33,457.00 and P69,653.60 with all supporting documents including the description of the services rendered by [V/L] Shipyard Corporation approved by Director Juanito B. Malig and Mr. Felix R. Gonzales, former Director of the Bureau, respectively, as Annexes 10 and 11. [83]\nWhen queried by the Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice, Bernaldo categorically declared that there was nothing wrong with the transaction relative to the award and sale of the vessel to the Corporation:\nPJ GARCHITORENA\nQuestions from the Court.\n\nQ Madam witness, as far as you are concerned what was wrong with the transaction or was there anything wrong with the transaction?\n\nWITNESS\nA I do not see anything wrong because the amount was more than the appraised value.\n\nQ So, as far as you are concerned the transaction was in order?\nA Yes, sir. [84]\nWhen asked whether her and petitioners' Joint Affidavit and Rejoinder Affidavit were correct even in the light of the June 18, 1986 Report, Bernaldo answered in the affirmative:\nQ Madam witness, when you executed this Joint Affidavit as well as the Rejoinder which have been marked as Exhibits 26 and 27[,] respectively[,] sometime in 1987, this superceded your previous Report, do you agree with me?\n\nPROS. TABANGUIL\nThat will call for the conclusion of the witness, your Honor.\n\nPJ GARCHITORENA\nSustained. If there is a contradiction then there is contradiction. Whether it supercedes or not is something you will have to find out, unless you will ask her why she excluded one and then the other.\n\nATTY. BLANES\n\nQ Now, when you executed Exhibit 26, Madam witness, you have taken into account your indorsement dated June 18, 1986\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And your Joint Affidavit and your Rejoinder explained correctly what actually happened with respect to the sale of M/V Malasugui?\n\nPROS. TABANGUIL\nVague, your Honor.\n\nPJ GARCHITORENA\nMay answer.\n\nWITNESS\nThey were both correct. [85]\nIt bears stressing that the Rejoinder Affidavit [86] executed by petitioners and Bernaldo were adduced in evidence by no less than the prosecution itself. Bernaldo even sought the dismissal of the criminal complaint filed by the Ombudsman against her for violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 based on the Joint Affidavit and Rejoinder Affidavit.\n\nNot to be outdone was COA auditor Marlene Nacua who declared on cross-examination that not only was the bidding process made on November 28, 1985 in order, but also that the bid of the Corporation was in accordance with COA regulations:\nATTY. PADERNAL\n\nQ At the time of the bid you know that procedure well.\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And knowing that procedure[,] you did not interpose any objection to the decision of the committee to open the bid, the lone bid of [V/L] Shipyard, is that correct.\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And am I correct to say also that as representative of the Commission on Audit during the bid although you act as a witness, you have to guide the committee as to the regulations of the Commission on Audit, is that correct, Mrs. Witness.\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And when the bid was opened to [V/L] Shipyard it was then your belief and perception at the time that the committee had followed all the regulations of the Commission on Audit.\nA Yes, sir. [87]\n\nx x x x\n\nQ That is why when the committee decided to open and award the bid to [V/L] Shipyard and submitted a payment of One Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Pesos (P138,900.00) you did not interpose any objection or guided the committee as to whether or not the bid was wrong or in accordance with the COA rules and regulations because you believe then that the bid and the opening of the bid was in accordance with the COA regulations, is that correct.\nA Yes, sir. [ 88]\nBy her testimony, Nacua thereby implied that the petitioners acted in good faith when the Committee conducted the bid process and made its recommendation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. The BFAR Director found no infirmity in the bid process, as shown in the minutes of the meeting on November 18, 1985 and the Committee's recommendation.\n\nMoreover, no less than BFAR Director Gonzales concurred with the Committee's recommendation and requested the Minister of Agriculture and Food for authority to award the sale of the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00 which included the P103,111.40 for services and berthing fees and P2,400.00 as publication fee. The Resident Auditor of the Ministry studied the matter very carefully and found no factual and legal basis for any objection to the recommendation. The Assistant Minister of Agriculture and Food also found the Committee's recommendation in accordance with law and COA rules and regulations, and directed the BFAR to award the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00. The Bureau Director complied with the directive. The ranking officials of the Ministry found no infirmity in the bid process and the Committee's recommendation, evidence of which was adduced by no less than the prosecution itself.\n\nWe agree with petitioners' contention that the recommendation of the Committee to the Ministry to approve the award of the sale was not in itself a contract of sale in favor of the Corporation. The sale of the vessel was perfected only upon notice to said Corporation that the sale of the vessel had been awarded to it.\n\nArticle 1318 of the New Civil Code provides that there is no contract unless the following requisites concur:\n\n(1) Consent of the contracting parties;\n(2) Object certain which is the subject matter of the contract;\n(3) Cause of the obligation which is established.\n\nConsent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain in such a way as to justify the other process in understanding that an assessment will conclude the agreement. An offer ripens into a contract when it is accepted. The offer must be certain and the acceptance absolute. [89]\n\nThus, a bid at an auction constitutes an offer to buy. Where, as in this case, the seller reserved the right to refuse to accept any bid made, a binding\n\nsale is not perfected until the seller accepts the bid. The seller may exercise his right to reject any bid even after the auctioneer has accepted a bid. [90] The mere determination of a public official bound to accept the offer or a proposal of a bidder does not constitute a contract. [91]\n\nAnent petitioners' contention that the Committee had no authority to dispose of the vessel to the Corporation through the sale at public auction, Section 1 of E.O. No. 888 provides that the Ministers or Heads of ministries of the government shall have the full and sole authority and responsibility to dispose of all unserviceable equipment and property:\nSection 1. Authority to Dispose - The provisions of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, the Ministers or Heads of Ministries/Agencies of the Government shall have the full and sole authority and responsibility to dispose of, all unserviceable equipment and property of their respective Ministries/Agencies . (emphasis supplied)\nIn cases of agencies attached to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food such as the BFAR, the Committee merely determines the awardee and makes a recommendation to the Minister concerned. In fine, the recommendation of the Committee is subject to such final approval:\n6. In the case of agencies attached to certain Ministries, recommendations of the Disposal Committee is subject to the final approval of the Minister concerned (emphasis supplied).\nThe awardee is not obliged to make payment for the property bid until after notice to the awardee. It is only when the awardee receives the notice of award that a contract of sale is perfected between the bidder and the seller.\n\nIn this case, the Corporation was notified of the award only after February 28, 1986. It was only upon its receipt of the notice of award that a contract of sale had been perfected between the government, as seller, and the Corporation as buyer. The Committee had no involvement in the sale of the vessel to the Corporation apart from its recommendation on the November 28, 1986 bidding, and yet, the Ombudsman indicted only petitioners, excluding the BFAR Director, Resident Auditor and Assistant Minister of Agriculture and Food.\n\nWe agree with petitioners' contention that the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 was not committed when the Committee conducted the bidding on November 28, 1985 and resolved to recommend to the Minister, through the BFAR Director, to award the sale of the vessel to the Corporation; neither was it committed when the award was made by the BFAR Director to the Corporation. This is so because there was as yet no evidence that the government sustained a loss of P53,529.60. The crime would have been committed if the Corporation had remitted to the National Treasurer the P138,900.00, and the P103,111.40 was applied by way of set-off against Bureau's account to said Corporation for Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589.\n\nThe prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the government lost P53,529.00 in the sale of the vessel. The only evidence presented is the Corporation's bid and the Report of Villa Bernaldo on June 18, 1986. The Prosecution offered no competent and sufficient evidence to prove the actual damages caused to the government. On the other hand, the BFAR Director declared that the vessel was sold to the Corporation for P138,900.00, which accepted and remitted the amount to the national treasury, as full payment of the vessel. The government receipted the amount \"as proceeds of the sale\" of the vessel. [92] To reiterate, there is no evidence on record that, after the Corporation had remitted the P138,900.00 on February 28, 1986, P103,111.40 thereof was applied to the Bureau's account under Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589 by way of set off. In fact, on January 6, 1986, before the sale of the vessel was awarded to the Corporation, the government had already remitted the P69,653.60 to it in payment of Bill No. 1589. The government did not even apply a portion of the P138,900.00 as payment of its account of P33,388.60 under Bill No. 1529, and instead paid the amount to the Corporation on May 12, 1986.\n\nThus, the full amount of the bid price, P138,900.00, which the Corporation remitted to the national treasury was intact as Bernaldo stated in her June 18, 1986 Report; yet, petitioners were prosecuted and convicted of violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019.\n\nIn fine then, the Court holds that the travesty which had been committed must be undone.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Sandiganbayan is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Petitioners Marietta T. Caugma, Amiana Abella and Rosauro Martinez are ACQUITTED of the crime charged.

NO. 168155, February 15, 2007 ]\n\nHEIRS OF MARINA C. REGALADO AND HEIRS OF ARNULFO C. REGALADO, REPRESENTED BY AMADEO C. REGALADO, PETITIONERS, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nHEIRS OF MARINA C. REGALADO AND HEIRS OF ARNULFO C. REGALADO, REPRESENTED BY AMADEO C. REGALADO, PETITIONERS, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nMarina Regalado (Marina) filed on July 14, 1987 an application for registration of a parcel of land situated in Sitio Balubad, Barrio Nangka, Marikina, Metro Manila which was surveyed and recorded as Psu-3907 (the property). [1]\n\nThe application, docketed as LRC Case No. 10916 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig, was published on November 14, 1988 in the Official Gazette and on November 28, 1988 in Nueva Era, a newspaper of general circulation. [2]\n\nMarina subsequently filed on January 18, 1991 a motion to withdraw the application without prejudice to the refiling of the same, citing as grounds\n. . . the discrepancies on the question of the survey and accession number corresponding to the survey plan of the property, the question thereof not being indubitable and to allow the Bureau of Lands time to examine its records; and for another compelling reason was the inevitable absence of applicant from the country to arrange and assist in the intestate estate of her late widowed sister whose children [were] all minors in London. [3] The motion to withdraw the application was granted on February 28, 1991.\n\nOn March 17, 1992, Marina filed a petition to reinstate the earlier application which was withdrawn.\u00a0 The court denied the petition on a technical ground. [4]\n\nOn May 6, 1992, Marina filed another application for land registration before the Pasig RTC.\n\nMarina later filed on May 28, 1992 an \u201cAmended Application for Registration\u201d [5] alleging, inter alia, that she had \u201cby herself or through her predecessor-in-interest . . . been in open, continuous and notorious possession and occupation of said land which is alienable and disposable of [ sic ] the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since 1945 or earlier\u201d; [6] and that she acquired the land \u201cby virtue of a Deed of Assignment dated January 3, 1977 executed by the registered claimant Tomas Antero as Assignor\u201d [7] in her favor.\n\nThe application was docketed as LRC Case No. R-4633, but was re-numbered as LRC No. N-11237. [8]\n\nTo the Amended Application, the National Housing Authority (NHA) filed an opposition on March 15, 1994, it claiming to be the owner of the property which it referred to as the \u201cBalubad Nangka Project\u201d and which had been declared as an Area for Priority Development under Proclamation No. 1967 dated May 14, 1980. [9]\n\nActing on the Amended Application, a \u201cNotice of Initial Hearing\u201d [10] scheduled on June 26, 1995 was published in the May 22, 1995 issue of the Official Gazette [11] and in the June 22, 1995 issue of Taliba . [12] Copies of the \u201cNotice of Initial Hearing\u201d were sent to all adjoining owners, the persons named therein with known addresses, and government agencies and offices concerned. [13]\n\nDuring the pendency of her application or on November 29, 1995, \u00a0Marina\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0died, hence, her counsel filed on February 21, 1996 a \u201cMotion to Substitute Applicant,\u201d alleging that her surviving heirs designated Arnulfo Regalado, her eldest son, as the applicant to pursue and litigate the land registration case in their behalf. [14] Branch 155 of the Pasig RTC granted the motion on April 30, 1996. [15]\n\nOn August 20, 1996, Arnulfo Regalado executed a Waiver of the \u201carea covered by the National Housing Authority [sic] without prejudice to the other land subject of the . . . petition.\u201d [16] In the same Waiver, he ceded, transferred, and waived 30,239 square meters of the property to the NHA. [17]\n\nFinding that \u201cthe possession of the substitute-applicant is open, continuous, adverse, against the whole world, in the concept of owner, and under a bona fide claim of ownership\u201d [18] and that \u201c[t]he\u00a0 property is not part of any forest zone nor of any aerial, military or naval reservations of the government and is classified to be alienable and disposable,\u201d [19] Branch 155 of the Pasig RTC, by Decision of August 12, 1997, ordered the registration of the property, except the portion which was waived in favor of the NHA, pro indiviso in the name of the heirs of Marina (Bernardita R. Carino, Amadeo C. Regalado, Ernesto C. Regalado, Elizabeth R. Cabading, Alberto C. Regalado, Milagros R. Escalante, and Arnulfo C. Regalado). [20]\n\nThe Republic of the Philippines (the Republic), through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a Notice of Appeal of the RTC decision. [21]\n\nBy Decision [22] of February 10, 2004, the Court of Appeals found for the Republic in this wise:\nWe sustain the first argument raised by the Republic as to the discrepancy in the lot size and technical description between the original as published vis-\u00e0-vis that stated in the petition even after the waiver of 30,239 square meters in favor of the NHA.\u00a0 It is notable too that there are differences among the original technical descriptions made for Tomas Antero [who allegedly assigned the property to Marina] (Exh. \u201cZ\u201d), that duly approved by the Bureau of Lands (Exh. \u201cAA\u201d), and also that published in the Taliba (Exh. \u201cF\u201d), from the final technical description of the subject land in the assailed Decision. This is a serious defect for the technical description sets the extent and boundaries of the land to be registered, and so should be precise for purposes of identification, delineation, and distinction, and notice to the public. [23] (Underscoring supplied) The appellate court thus dismissed the application for registration.\n\nTheir Motion for Reconsideration [24] having been denied, [25] Marina\u2019s heirs filed the instant Petition [26] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, faulting the Court of Appeals to have erred\n. . . IN ENTERTAINING THE APPEAL OF THE REPUBLIC DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT PARTY IN THE CASE AS IT HAD NOT FILED ANY OPPOSITION OR ANSWER AGAINST THE APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION BEFORE THE COURT A QUO;\n\n. . . . IN FINDING THAT THE COURT A QUO DID NOT ACQUIRE JURISDICTION OVER THE APPLICATION FOR DECREE OF REGISTRATION OVER THE INSTANT CASE\n\n. . . IN FINDING THAT PETITIONERS FAILED TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR REGISTERABLE RIGHTS OVER THE SUBJECT LAND IN THE CASE AT BAR. [27] (Underscoring supplied) In the meantime, the heirs of Marina designated Amadeo Regalado as their\nattorney-in-fact to pursue the application. [28]\n\nThe petition is devoid of merit.\n\nThe failure of the Republic to file any opposition or answer to the application for registration, despite receipt of notice thereof, [29] did not deprive its right to appeal the RTC decision. [30]\nRelative to the allegation that the Director of Lands or that the government did not oppose the application of herein respondent, as in fact on December 26, 1969 an order of general default was issued by the court against the whole world, suffice it to say that as stated by this Court in Luciano v. Esterella, 34 SCRA 769, \u201cit is a well known and settled rule in our jurisdiction that the Republic, or its government, is usually not estopped by mistake or error on the part of its officials or agents.\u201d And, in an earlier case, Republic vs. Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., 32 SCRA 211, \u201cthere was an enunciation of such a principle in this wise: \u2018Thus did the lower court, as pointed out by the then Solicitor General, conclude that the government was bound by the mistaken interpretation arrived at by the national treasurer and the auditor general.\u00a0 It would consider estoppel as applicable.\u00a0 That is not the law.\u00a0 Estoppel does not lie.\u201d [31] (Underscoring supplied) Respecting the finding of the appellate court on the \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d in the lot size and technical descriptions mentioned in the earlier-quoted portion of its decision, the heirs contend that \u201c[w]hat appears, after a careful comparison of the approved survey plan (Exh. \u2018Z\u2019), and that republished [ sic ] with Taliba (Exh. \u2018F\u2019) and the Official Gazette (Exhibit \u2018CC\u2019), were simple clerical errors and minor discrepancies which do not substantially alter the technical description of the subject property as published by the Land Registration Authority in the Official Gazette (Exh. \u2018CC\u2019) and that by petitioner with the Taliba (Exh. \u2018F\u2019).\u201d [32]\n\nPetitioners conclude that any such discrepancy \u201cwas unsubstantial and did not in any way affect the jurisdiction of the Land Registration Court.\u201d\n\nPetitioners\u2019 contention fail in light of the following clear pronouncement of this Court in Fewkes v. Vasquez, [33] viz:\nUnder Section 21 of the Land Registration Act, an application for registration of land is required to contain, among others, a description of the land subject of the proceeding, the name, status and address of the applicant, as well as the names and addresses of all occupants of the land and of all adjoining owners, if known, or if unknown, of the steps taken to locate them.\u00a0 When the application is set by the court for initial hearing, it is then that notice (of the hearing), addressed to all persons appearing to have an interest in the lot being registered and the adjoining owners, and indicating the location, boundaries and technical description of the land being registered, shall be published in the Official Gazette for two consecutive times. It is this publication of the notice of hearing that is considered one of the essential bases of the jurisdiction of the court in land registration cases, for the proceedings being in rem , i t is only when there is constructive seizure of the land, effected by the publication and notice, that jurisdiction over the res is vested on the court.\u00a0 Furthermore, it is such notice and publication of the hearing that would enable all persons concerned, who may have any rights or interests in the property, to come forward and show to the court why the application for registration thereof is not to be granted.\n\nIt must be remembered that the application in this case filed in the court below was for registration, not of the big parcel of land (Lot No. 1383, Pls-764-D or Lot no. 21), but of certain portions thereof designated by applicant-appellant as Lots Nos. 21-A and 21-B. It is the technical description of these 2 smaller lots, therefore, that must be published in order that the persons who may be affected by their registration may be notified thereof.\u00a0 For, considering that the adjoining owners of Lot No. 21 would not be the same as the owners of the properties adjoining Lots Nos. 21-A and 21-B, the notification of the adjoining owners of the big lot would not be the notice to the adjoining owners or occupants of the smaller lots required by law.\u00a0 In short, it is the publication of the specific boundaries of Lots Nos. 21-A and 21-B that would actually put the interested parties on notice of the registration proceeding, and would confer authority on the land registration court to pass upon the issue of the registerability of said lots in favor of the applicant. [34] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nMarina\u2019s heirs invoke Benin v. Tuason , [35] synthesizing its ruling as follows, quoted verbatim:\n\u201cAn slight increase in area registered over the area contained in the application is not fatal to the decree of registration.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cRegistration Court has no jurisdiction only in so far as areas not covered by original application are added.\u201d\u00a0 Also, \u201cAmendment to application for registration need not be published anew if merely excludes portions covered by the original application. [36] (Underscoring supplied) It is not the lot or property size alone, however, in which the appellate court found a discrepancy.\u00a0 More importantly, it found discrepancy in the technical descriptions of the property appearing in the different documents material to the resolution of the Amended Application for registration.\n\nIN ANY EVENT, Marina\u2019s heirs as applicants in this land registration case \u201cbear the burden of overcoming the presumption that the land sought to be registered forms part of the public domain.\u201d [37] This they failed to discharge.\n\nIn another vein, while the heirs claim that Tomas Antero assigned the property to Marina by a Deed of Assignment, no proof was presented that Tomas Antero had possessed the same in the concept of an owner.\u00a0 That the property was surveyed for Tomas Antero [38] does not prove his ownership. [39] Marina\u2019s heirs themselves admit, in their petition filed before this Court, the doubtful nature of Tomas Antero\u2019s title to the property, thus:\nIt is worth pointing out that the very reason why the previous owner \u00a0Tomas Antero of the subject lot failed to secure the corresponding Tax Declaration was because of the apparent hesitation of then Municipality of Marikina, Metro Manila to issue the same, contending that it considered the same as part of the public domain. That attitude of the Municipality of Marikina, Metro Manila could be readily gleaned from the very Tax Declaration No. B-0069187 issued to petitioner Marina C. Regalado, the specific portion thereof is quoted, to wit:\n\nNOTE:\nIt is believed that the land covered by this declaration form [sic] part of the public domain and was assessed upon the insistence of the declarant and upon compliance with Article 5-E of the Assessment Regulation No. 3-75. [40] (Underscoring in the original; emphasis supplied) Other than Marina\u2019s uncorroborated testimony given in a previous attempt to have the property registered, there is no proof to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that Marina, her uncle, aunt, and other relatives have been residing in the property for more than 30 years and that she herself had been residing there for 15 years when Tomas Antero executed the deed of assignment in her favor. [41]\n\nMarina\u2019s admission that she does not know the name of the public road traversing the property [42] belies her claim that she resided therein for 15 years.\u00a0 At most, the evidence indicates that \u00a0Marina possessed and occupied a small portion of the property, while some 600 other parties possessed and occupied the rest. [43]\n\nAs for the tax declaration in the name of Marina, [44] it is not conclusive proof of ownership.\u00a0 While it is a good indication of possession in the concept of owner, [45] delayed declaration of property for tax purposes negates\n\na claim of continuous, exclusive, and interrupted possession in the concept of an owner. [46]\n\nIn the case at bar, Marina claimed that the property was assigned to her as early as 1977, yet she only declared it for tax purposes in 1988, [47] following her first attempt to have the land registered on July 14, 1987. [48]\n\nAnd, there is no proof that Marina religiously paid taxes on the property.\u00a0 In fact, in her testimony, she twice stated that she intended to pay taxes only if and when ordered to do so by the court. [49] The photocopies of Tax Receipt Nos. 7436713 and 7436714 annexed to the motion for reconsideration filed by Marina\u2019s heirs before the Court of Appeals cannot be appreciated in their favor.\u00a0 On top of being mere photocopies, they were not offered in evidence before the trial court.\u00a0 To consider them at the appeal stage would deny the other parties the right to rebut them. [50]\n\nIn fine, the trial court\u2019s finding that Marina had been in open, continuous, and adverse possession in the concept of owner and under a bona fide claim of ownership [51] fails.\u00a0\u00a0 The reversal by the appellate court of the trial court\u2019s decision must thus be upheld.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED and the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED .\n\nCosts against petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] RTC records, pp. 19, 21.\n\n[2] Id. at 21.\n\n[3] Id. at 20.\n\n[4] Id. at 21.\n\n[5] Id. at 18-24.\n\n[6] Id. at 18.\n\n[7] Ibid.; Folder of exhibits, Volume I, pp. 45-46.\n\n[8] RTC records, p. 333.\n\n[9] Id. at 185.\n\n[10] Id. at 338-33A-A.\n\n[11] Id. at 341, 343.\n\n[12] Folder of exhibits, Vol. I, pp. 1-2.\n\n[13] RTC records, p. 342.\n\n[14] Id. at 357-361.\n\n[15] Id. at 363-364.\n\n[16] Id. at 380.\n\n[17] Ibid.\n\n[18] Id. at 427.\n\n[19] Ibid.\n\n[20] Id. at 428-430.\n\n[21] Rollo, p. 432.\n\n[22] Penned by Court of Appeals Associate Justice Roberto A.

NO. 148544, July 12, 2006 ]\n\nFELIX M. CRUZ, JR., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND CITYTRUST BANKING\nCORPORATION,D E C I S I O N\nFELIX M. CRUZ, JR., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND CITYTRUST BANKING\nCORPORATION,\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeking to annul the April 27, 2001 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 52373 which affirmed the January 27, 1998 Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and its Resolution, dated May 14, 1998 in NLRC NCR CA 011087-96 (NLRC NCR 00-10-06448-93-A).\n\nThe factual and procedural antecedents of the case, as summarized by the CA, are as follows:\nCruz [herein petitioner Felix M. Cruz, Jr.] was an employee of private respondent Citytrust Banking Corporation (or Citytrust) from October 8, 1979. He held the confidential position of Micro Technical Support Officer, with the following duties and responsibilities: (a) Evaluate and recommend from various departments/units request for Micro Computers received by the Bidding Committee. (b) Further evaluate and accept the bids submitted including recommendation therof, which were done by the Technical Committee of the Bank (Petitioner's Affidavit, p. 102, rollo). The good performance of Cruz did not remain unnoticed for on several occasions he was recognized with awards and citations, given salary increases (Exhs, \"A to H\", \"J-K\", pp. 45-50, 52-53, rollo) and promoted to Authorized Signer on May 1, 1991. (Exh. \"I\", p. 51, rollo).\n\nBut after all his years of reputed fealty and good service with the company, something unexpected and besmirching was uncovered. There were feedbacks and informations that certain irregularities were being committed in the bidding process and purchase of computers, an area within the powers and responsibilities of Cruz. To clarify matters, a special investigation was conducted by the Citytrust Internal Audit Group and it was found out that indeed there were unauthorized and unreported commissions and rebates given out by one of its computer suppliers, MECO Enterprises, Inc. (MECO), for purchases made by Citytrust. This was corroborated by the letter dated August 5, 1992 (Exh. \"1\", p. 148, rollo) of the President and Controller [sic] of MECO certifying that Cruz has received commissions and rebates amounting to P105,192.00 just for the period of September 1992 to March 1993.\n\nWith this damaging result of the investigation, Citytrust sent a show-cause memorandum (Exh. \"13\", p. 161, rollo) to Cruz on August 6, 1993 placing him under a 30-day preventive suspension and directing him to appear in an administrative hearing by the Ad Hoc Committee. Cruz submitted the said memorandum, the Ad Hoc Committee heard the matter, and found Cruz guilty of fraud, serious misconduct, gross dishonesty and serious violation of Bank policies, regulations and procedure. For the resultant loss of confidence, Citytrust terminated Cruz from employment effective October 6, 1993 (Exh \"15\", pp. 164-165, rollo).\n\nAggrieved by this, Cruz filed before the Labor Arbiter an action for Illegal Dismissal and Damages claiming that Citytrust denied him due process and hastily dismissed him from service. After the submission of position papers and presentation of witnesses, the Labor Arbiter rendered decision in favor of Cruz disposing that:\n\n\"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering respondent to reinstate complainant to his former position without loss of seniority rights with full backwages which up to the promulgation of this Decision amounted to THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY (P387,790.00) Pesos, subject to adjustment upon actual reinstatement; to pay complainant his 13th month pay in the sum of THIRTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN & 83/100 (P32,315.83) Pesos; and to pay the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) Pesos as and for damages, plus attorney's fees in the sum of FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND TEN & 58/100 (P47,010.58) Pesos representing ten percent (10%) of the monetary award due complainant, subject also to adjustment.\n\nSO ORDERED.\" (p. 26, rollo)\n\nFrom this decision Citytrust appealed to the NLRC, which through its Second Division rendered the Decision dated January 27, 1998 wherein the ruling of the Labor Arbiter was set aside and went on dismissing the case for lack of merit. (p. 37, rollo).\n\nCruz filed a motion for its reconsideration but this was denied for lack of merit.... [2]\nCruz then filed a petition for certiorari with this Court. In a Resolution dated February 15, 1999, [3] the Court referred the petition to the CA for appropriate action and disposition, pursuant to the ruling in the case of St. Martin Funeral Homes v. National Labor Relations Commission. [4]\n\nOn April 27, 2001, the CA rendered the presently assailed Decision denying due course to and dismissing the petition. Sustaining the NLRC, the CA held that while it is true that the signature of petitioner does not appear in the check vouchers, other pieces of evidence prove that he benefited from the proceeds of the checks issued; that there is substantial evidence to hold petitioner liable for soliciting and receiving monetary considerations from a supplier; that his act constituted a willful breach of his employer's trust and confidence which justifies his termination from employment; that petitioner's dismissal from employment was the result of a thorough investigation and hearing where he was given the opportunity to explain his side.\n\nInstead of a motion for reconsideration, petitioner filed the present petition for certiorari predicated on the following grounds:\nTHAT PUBLIC RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSE(D) ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN SETTING ASIDE THE DECISION OF THE LABOR ARBITER A QUO\n\nTHAT HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN CONCLUDING THAT EXHIBITS 2 TO 10 [IN] WHICH PETITIONER'S SIGNATURE DOES NOT APPEAR, THE FACTS REMAIN THAT HE BENEFITED FROM THE ALLEGED ANOMALOUS TRANSACTIONS, ONE MA. CRESENCIA MANGUERRA ENCASHED THE CHECK USING THE BANK ACCOUNT OF PETITIONER ALLEGING THAT THE LATTER IS PETITIONER['S] PARAMOUR. [5]\nPetitioner claims that while his name appears in the check vouchers issued by MECO, marked as Exhibits \"2\" to \"10\", the incontrovertible fact remains that his signature does not appear in any of said vouchers. Not being a signatory of any of the said check vouchers, petitioner contends that there can be no basis in concluding that he ever received any commission, special discount or rebate from MECO. Petitioner also asserts that he was denied due process because he was not given the opportunity to refute the charges imputed against him. While it is true that private respondent conducted an investigation, petitioner claims that the same was done without his participation. [6]\n\nIn its Comment, private respondent contends that the present petition for certiorari is not the proper remedy to assail the subject decision of the CA. Private respondent asserts that a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court may be availed of only when a party has no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Petitioner argues that what petitioner should have done was to file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, and that petitioner's failure to file a petition for review cannot be remedied by the filing of a special civil action for certiorari . Even assuming that petitioner is allowed to institute the present petition for certiorari , private respondent contends that the same must still be dismissed because what is being assailed are the factual findings of the CA and the NLRC and settled is the rule that in certiorari proceedings under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, judicial review does not go as far as to evaluate the sufficiency of evidence upon which the NLRC based its determinations, the inquiry being limited essentially to whether or not said tribunal has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. In any case, private respondent further contends that petitioner failed to prove that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion because pieces of documentary and oral evidence bear out the fact that petitioner indeed received various amounts from MECO either as commission, special discount or rebate without private respondent's knowledge and approval. [7]\n\nThe Court does not find merit in the present petition for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, it is well settled that the remedy to obtain reversal or modification of judgment on the merits is appeal. [8] This is true even if the error, or one of the errors, ascribed to the court rendering the judgment is its lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or the exercise of power in excess thereof, or grave abuse of discretion in the findings of facts or of law set out in the decision. [9] In the present case, the CA disposed of CA-G.R. SP No. 52373 on the merits. Petitioner claims that he received the Decision of the CA on May 17, 2001. Consequently, he had 15 days from said date of receipt of assailed judgment, or until June 1, 2001, within which to file a petition for review on certiorari , the reglementary period prescribed by Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to avail of said action. On July 9, 2001 close to two months after said receipt, petitioner filed the present petition. Evidently, petitioner has lost his remedy of appeal. The filing of the instant petition for certiorari cannot be used as a means of recovering his appeal as it is settled that certiorari is not a substitute for lost appeal. [10] The remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive. [11]\n\nSecond, assuming for the sake of argument that the present petition for certiorari is the appropriate remedy, the records of the instant case show that petitioner failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the appellate court, thus, depriving the CA of the opportunity to correct on reconsideration such errors as it may have committed. The first paragraph of Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court clearly states that in order for a person to avail of the special civil action of certiorari , he must be left with no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, to wit:\nSECTION 1. Petition for Certiorari. \u2013 When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court , alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board of officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require. (Italics supplied)\nA motion for reconsideration of an assailed decision is deemed a plain and adequate remedy expressly available under the law. [12] The general rule is that a motion for reconsideration is indispensable before resort to the special civil action for certiorari to afford the court or tribunal the opportunity to correct its error, if any. [13] This rule is subject to certain recognized exceptions, to wit:\n(a) where the order is a patent nullity, as where the court a quo has no jurisdiction;\n\n(b) where the questions raised in the certiorari proceedings have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court;\n\n(c) where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the Government or of the petitioner or the subject matter of the action is perishable;\n\n(d) where, under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless;\n\n(e) where petitioner was deprived of due process and there is extreme urgency for relief;\n\n(f) where, in a criminal case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent and the granting of such relief by the trial court is improbable;\n\n(g) where the proceedings in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process;\n\n(h) where the proceeding was ex parte or in which the petitioner had no opportunity to object; and\n\n(i) where the issue raised is one purely of law or where public interest is involved. [14]\nNone of these exceptions are present in the instant case. Hence, petitioner's unjustified failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the CA before recourse to this special civil action was made calls for the outright dismissal of this case.\n\nThird, going into the merits of the case, the Court finds that the dismissal of the instant petition is warranted for failure of petitioner to show grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the CA.\n\nPetitioner was dismissed from employment on the ground, among others, of loss of trust and confidence. Loss of trust and confidence, as a valid ground for dismissal, must be substantiated by evidence. Jurisprudence has distinguished the treatment of managerial employees or employees occupying positions of trust and confidence from that of rank-and-file personnel, insofar as the application of the doctrine of trust and confidence is concerned. In Caoile v. National Labor Relations Commission, the Court had occasion to explain as follows:\nThus, with respect to rank-and-file personnel, loss of trust and confidence as ground for valid dismissal requires proof of involvement in the alleged events in question, and that mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not be sufficient. But as regards a managerial employee, the mere existence of a basis for believing that such employee has breached the trust of his employer would suffice for his dismissal. Hence, in the case of managerial employees, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for such loss of confidence, such as when the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee concerned is responsible for the purported misconduct, and the nature of his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position . [15] (Emphasis supplied)\nIn addition, the language of Article 282(c) of the Labor Code states that the loss of trust and confidence must be based on willful breach of the trust reposed in the employee by his employer. Such breach is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. [16] Moreover, it must be based on substantial evidence and not on the employer's whims or caprices or suspicions otherwise, the employee would eternally remain at the mercy of the employer. [17] Loss of confidence must not be indiscriminately used as a shield by the employer against a claim that the dismissal of an employee was arbitrary. [18] And, in order to constitute a just cause for dismissal, the act complained of must be work-related and shows that the employee concerned is unfit to continue working for the employer. [19] In addition, loss of confidence as a just cause for termination of employment is premised on the fact that the employee concerned holds a position of responsibility, trust and confidence [20] or that the employee concerned is entrusted with confidence with respect to delicate matters, such as the handling or care and protection of the property and assets of the employer. [21] The betrayal of this trust is the essence of the offense for which an employee is penalized. [22]\n\nThere is no dispute that petitioner is a confidential employee. During his cross-examination, he testified that aside from evaluating and recommending the purchase of Micro Computers, he also supervises the maintenance of computer hardware including the installation of computers for Citytrust in all of its branches nationwide. [23] It is clear from the foregoing that petitioner is not an ordinary rank-and-file employee. His job entails the observance of proper company procedures relating to the acquisition, installation and maintenance of computers which, undeniably, are vital to the operations of his employer. Moreover, his functions are not limited to a specific unit of Citytrust but extend to all branches of his employer nationwide. Thus, his job involves a high degree of responsibility requiring a substantial amount of trust and confidence on the part of his employer.\n\nThe question that remains then is whether there is substantial evidence to prove that petitioner is guilty of the charges imputed against him as to justify Citytrust in dismissing him from employment on the ground of loss of trust and confidence.\n\nPetitioner contends that without his signatures appearing in the check vouchers issued by MECO, there can be no basis in coming up with the conclusion that he received and appropriated commissions and rebates without the knowledge and authority of Citytrust.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded.\n\nPetitioner's reliance on the case of Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission [24] is misplaced. In the said case, the private respondent, who is an employee of petitioner corporation, was charged with the unauthorized withdrawal and misappropriation of 192 liters of gasoline from company stocks and for knowingly allowing company personnel to work on company time in the assembly of a privately-owned vehicle. To prove the first charge, the petitioner company presented in evidence entries in a logbook showing gasoline withdrawals allegedly made by private respondent. In ruling against the petitioner company, the Court held that since respondent's signature does not appear in the logbook, there is no proof that he actually withdrew and received the gasoline. In fact, the Court ruled that the logbook cannot be relied upon to establish the alleged dishonesty of private respondent. Neither did the Court give credence to the testimonies of the witnesses against him. In sum, no competent evidence was presented to prove the private respondent's liability. This is not the situation in the present case.\n\nIt is true that the check vouchers alone are not sufficient to prove his guilt owing to the fact that his signatures do not appear in any of these vouchers. However, aside from the abovementioned check vouchers, there are other pieces of evidence presented by Citytrust which petitioner failed to refute and which points to the fact that he received commissions or rebates from MECO. The evidence consists of the following: (1) admission made by petitioner in his letter, dated August 3, 1993, that he received material considerations from MECO since 1992; [25] (2) certification issued by MECO categorically stating that he was paid commissions totaling P105,192.00; [26] (3) testimonies of Leoncio Araullo, Vice President of Citytrust; and Ma. Lourdes Foronda, Assistant Vice President for Staff Services Division of the Human Resources Department of Citytrust, that petitioner admitted having received the amounts of P1,000.00 and P500.00 from Art Cordero, an officer of MECO, claiming that these amounts are \"for the boys\"; (4) statements in the affidavit of Florante del Mundo, auditor at the Internal Audit Department of Citytrust that two of the checks issued by MECO in favor of petitioner were either encashed by the latter's common-law-wife or deposited in his account. [27] In addition, the Court agrees with the CA that annotations appearing in the check vouchers issued by MECO such as \"Payment for the Rebate Given to Boy Cruz of Citytrust\" [28] and \"Payment for the Sales Rebate Given to Boy Cruz of Citytrust\" [29] are confirmations of the fact that the checks were issued and given specifically by MECO to petitioner in consideration of his office and services. These pieces of evidence, when taken together, would constitute substantial evidence to prove petitioner's guilt; and his failure to satisfactorily explain or rebut them only strengthens Citytrust's case against him.\n\nThus, petitioner's acceptance of commissions and rebates from MECO, without the knowledge and consent of Citytrust and without said rebates and commissions being reported and turned over to the latter, are acts which can clearly be considered as a willful breach of the trust and confidence reposed by Citytrust upon him. Settled is the rule that an employer cannot be compelled to retain an employee who is guilty of acts inimical to the interests of the employer. [30] A company has the right to dismiss its employees if only as a measure of self-protection. [31] This is all the more true in the case of supervisors or personnel occupying positions of responsibility. [32] In the present case, the Court finds that the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that Citytrust is justified in dismissing petitioner from his employment for loss of trust and confidence.\n\nPetitioner contends that he was denied his right to due process because the investigation conducted by Citytrust was done ex-parte and he was not given the opportunity to confront the witnesses against him. Petitioner's concept of the opportunity to be heard is the chance to ventilate one's side in a formal hearing where he can have a face-to-face confrontation with his accusers. It is well settled that the basic requirement of notice and hearing in termination cases is for the employer to inform the employee of the specific charges against him and to hear his side and defenses. [33] This does not, however, mean a full adversarial proceeding. [34] The parties may be heard through pleadings, written explanations, position papers, memorandum or oral argument. [35] In all of these instances, the employer plays an active role by providing the employee with the opportunity to present his side and answer the charges in substantial compliance with due process. [36] In the present case, petitioner cannot claim that he was denied due process because he was able to respond to the letter of Citytrust dated August 6, 1993. [37] Moreover, he admitted in his cross-examination before the labor arbiter that he was able to attend the investigation of the ad hoc committee formed by Citytrust where he was shown the check vouchers issued by MECO, informed of the charges against him and was given further opportunity to explain his side. [38] Hence, the fact alone that he was not able to confront the witnesses against him during the investigation conducted by Citytrust does not mean that he was denied his right to due process. What is frowned upon is the absolute lack of notice and hearing. [39]\n\nAs to the requirement of notice, the Labor Code provides that before an employee can be validly dismissed, the employer is required to furnish the employee with two (2) written notices: (a) a written notice containing a statement of the cause for termination to afford the employee ample opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of his representative, if he so desires; and, (b) if the employer decides to terminate the services of the employee, the employer must notify him in writing of the decision to dismiss him, stating clearly the reasons therefor. [40] Citytrust complied with the first requirement of notice when it informed petitioner through a letter, dated August 6, 1993, of the charges against him, directing him to explain in writing why his employment should not be terminated and, thereafter, to appear in a hearing to be conducted by the company to give him further opportunity to explain his side. [41] Citytrust also complied with the second requirement of notice when it sent a memorandum dated September 28, 1993, to petitioner informing him of his dismissal from employment and the reasons therefor.

CV No. 51750, which affirmed in toto the Decision, [2] dated 25 July 1995, of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 51, Bacolod City, in Civil Case No. 4361, dismissing the Complaint for Damages for malicious prosecution, filed by petitioners against respondents. The RTC rendered judgment declaring that the prosecution was not prompted by sinister design to vex and humiliate petitioner Rosemarie Magbanua.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals similarly found the appeal without merit.\n\nThe following are the antecedent facts:\n\nPetitioner Rosemarie Magbanua, who worked as a housemaid in the residence of complainant and herein respondent Pilar S. Junsay\u00a0 was charged as a co-accused with the crime of Robbery before the RTC, Branch XLI of Bacolod City in Criminal Case No. 28 entitled, People of the Philippines v. Rosemarie Magbanua, et al. , by virtue of an Information, which recites, thus:\nThat on or about the 18 th day of July, 1982, in the City of Bacolod, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with intent to gain and with the use of force upon things by then and there making a hole on the lower portion of the kitchen's door of the house of the herein offended party, Dra. Pilar S. Junsay, situated at Bata Subdivision, Bacolod City, through which opening made (sic) them, said accused gained entrance thereto and once inside the said house, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, rob and carry away with them, assorted jewelries and cash, valued all in all in the amount of P29,624.00, Pesos, Philippine Currency, to the damage and prejudice of the herein offended party in the aforementioned amount. [3]\nThe records show that only petitioner Rosemarie was tried in Criminal Case No. 28.\u00a0 Her co-accused, Ernesto Fernandez and a certain Gudo, remain at large.\n\nThe case for the prosecution relied on an alleged confession made by petitioner Rosemarie, admitting her participation in the crime of Robbery.\u00a0 The defense contested the admissibility of the confession, and averred that the same was made under duress.\n\nOn 20 December 1985, the RTC, Branch XLI of Bacolod City, rendered a Decision, [4] acquitting petitioner Rosemarie of the crime of Robbery. The RTC held:\nThe evidence for accused [herein petitioner Rosemarie] more particularly the Medical Certificate and the testimony of the attending physician as well as the Decision of the NAPOLCOM finding the investigating officers guilty has clearly establish (sic) the fact that accused was physically maltreated by the investigating officers in an attempt to force her to confess her participation in the robbery.\u00a0 Whatever declaration of accused therefore against her interest is inadmissible in evidence against her, hence, the alleged admission of the accused that she participated in the commission of the Robbery made to the police investigator and complainant [complainant respondent Pilar] even if it is true cannot be used against her.\u00a0 Notwithstanding however, accused could still be found guilty if the evidence for the prosecution is sufficient to establish her participation in the crime without said alleged admission by the accused.\u00a0 Record, however, shows that other than the alleged admission of the accused made to the police investigator and the complainant, the only evidence to establish the participation of the accused in the robbery is the testimony of the complaining witness that after accused informed her that part of the jewelry stolen was inside her bag at her room, the complaining witness searched the room of accused and found one (1) piece of gold necklace.\u00a0 On this point, the evidence adduced shows that the police authorities went at (sic) the scene of the robbery and thoroughly investigated the incident including dusting for fingerprints, tending to show that the investigation of the police authorities was extensive, hence, it was quite improbable and difficult to believe that the police investigator would fail to search the bag nor the room of accused.\u00a0 This Court[,] therefore[,] find said testimony of the complaining witness on this point discredited. [5]\nThe decretal portion of the 20 December 1985 RTC Decision pronounced:\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING THEREFORE, this Court finds the evidence for the prosecution not only insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt but even insufficient to establish a prima facie case against her for having participated in the robbery subject of the above entitled case and therefore ACQUITS accused on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.\u00a0 The bailbond of the accused for her provisional liberty is hereby ordered cancelled. [6]\nOn 9 March 1987, petitioner Rosemarie, assisted by Artemio Taborada, and together with co-petitioner Conrado Magbanua \u00a0(Rosemarie's father) filed with the RTC, Branch 51, Bacolod City, a Complaint for Damages [7] against respondent Pilar, assisted by her husband Vicente Junsay, Ibarra Lopez, and Juanito Jacela.\u00a0 Respondent Pilar was the employer of petitioner Rosemarie, while respondents Ibarra and Juanito were members of the police force of Bacolod City, and assigned at the Police Station in Taculing, Bacolod City.\n\nThe Complaint, alleged, inter alia , that by reason of respondents' false, malicious, and illegal actuations in filing Criminal Case No. 28 for Robbery against petitioner Rosemarie, the latter suffered untold pain, shame, humiliation, worry, and mental anguish,\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0which if assessed in monetary terms will not be less than P200,000.00. [8] It was further alleged therein that Conrado, Rosemarie's father, lost his job and his entire family suffered. [9] Petitioners maintained that Rosemarie suffered physical pain and mental torture due to the filing of the false criminal charge against her. [10] They sought moral and exemplary damages, including attorney's fees and litigation expenses, as well as loss of earnings and expenses incurred in connection with Rosemarie's defense in Criminal Case No. 28 for Robbery. [11] They similarly prayed for payment of the expenses incurred in the prosecution of the instant case.\n\nSubsequently, petitioners filed a Petition to litigate as pauper which the RTC granted in its Order dated 9 March 1987, it appearing that they had no means to prosecute their action. [12]\n\nRespondent Pilar filed a Motion to Dismiss, [13] on the ground that the cause of action is barred by the Statute of Limitations, as crystallized in Article 1146 [14] of the Civil Code.\u00a0 From the time the cause of action arose to the filing of the Complaint, four years and eight months had already lapsed.\n\nPetitioners filed an Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, [15] contending that their cause of action is not for damages based on the physical injuries suffered by Rosemarie during the investigation of the criminal case nor the violation of her rights for the indignities foisted upon her by the respondents from 18 July 1982, and several days thereafter. [16] They posited that the damages sought are for the malicious prosecution of Rosemarie.\u00a0 They reasoned that the baseless filing of the criminal case for Robbery against Rosemarie, despite her protestations of innocence and the lack of evidence against her, caused her family to incur expenses and subjected her to untold shame and humiliation. [17] Petitioners clarified that the allegations about the violation of Rosemarie's rights as a person were included only to demonstrate respondents' palpable malice in the filing of the said criminal case against her.\u00a0 Petitioners postulated that as the Complaint for Damages is for malicious prosecution, the prescriptive period should be counted from the date of Rosemarie's acquittal in Criminal Case No. 28, or on 20 December 1985, and not from 18 July 1982, the date when respondents injured the rights of Rosemarie.\u00a0 From the time judgment in Criminal Case No. 28 was rendered to the filing of the Complaint in the instant case, not more than one year and three months had passed. [18]\n\nOn 24 March 1988, the RTC issued an Order [19] denying respondents' Motion to Dismiss for lack of merit.\u00a0 It found that the cause of action of petitioners' Complaint was based on malicious prosecution; hence, the prescriptive period shall be counted from the date of petitioner Rosemarie's acquittal.\u00a0 According to the RTC, the allegations about the wanton violation of the rights of Rosemarie as a person were to show the pattern of respondents' malice.\n\nRespondent Pilar filed before the RTC an Answer, [20] dated 18 May 1988, disclaiming petitioners' allegation that she maltreated petitioner Rosemarie while the latter was being investigated by the police authorities.\u00a0 She posited, inter alia : that she was not present during the investigation, and was subsequently informed of petitioner Rosemarie's participation in the robbery by the investigators, the same being reflected in the Joint Affidavit of the police investigators; that she never laid a hand on petitioner Rosemarie before, during, or after the investigation, as, in fact, she had no inkling of her participation in the crime; that she had no hand in the filing of the case except to execute an affidavit regarding her ownership of the lost jewelry; and that she has no liability whatsoever to petitioner Rosemarie, much less, to her father, petitioner Conrado, who does not appear to have any involvement in the matter. [21] By way of counterclaim, she sought damages, including attorney's fees, and costs of suit from the petitioners.\n\nPetitioners filed a Reply and Answer to Counterclaim, [22] reiterating the allegation in the Complaint, that respondent Pilar actually participated in the maltreatment of petitioner Rosemarie, and she cannot deny her participation as she was always present in the police station during the investigation.\u00a0 Petitioners alleged that respondent Pilar cannot claim lack of knowledge of the maltreatment and indignities suffered by petitioner Rosemarie because she herself participated in such maltreatment.\u00a0 Petitioners further contended, inter alia, that they have a proper and valid cause of action against the respondents, including petitioner Conrado who suffered and incurred expenses to defend his daughter, Rosemarie, who was then a minor against unjust accusation, maltreatment and torture.\n\nOn 9 September 1988, at the pre-trial, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts.\u00a0 Counsel for the petitioners manifested that they were claiming damages not for physical injuries which petitioner Rosemarie allegedly suffered in the hands of respondents during her investigation, but for her malicious prosecution. [23] In concurrence thereto, counsel for respondents declared that the main issue was whether Rosemarie was maliciously prosecuted with the filing of the criminal case for Robbery. [24] Following the stipulations and counter-stipulation of facts, pre-trial was terminated.\n\nMeanwhile, respondents Ibarra and Juanito, members of the police force of Bacolod City, filed an Answer and Manifestation, [25] adopting the Answer filed by their co-respondent Pilar, dated 18 May 1988, insofar as the allegations therein were applicable to them, and further adopting the counterclaim interposed in the aforesaid action.\n\nTrial, thereafter, ensued.\n\nSeeking to fortify their case, petitioners offered the following exhibits, to wit:\nExhibit \"A\" - The medical certificate issued by Dr. Teodoro S. Lavasa, Medico-legal officer and Chief, Crime Laboratory, Bacolod Metro Police District, dated July 27, 1982.\n\nThis exhibit is offered to show the many injuries sustained by [herein petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua at the hands of the [herein respondents] in their joint effort to make her admit the crime in the absence of proof that she participated therein and despite her protestations of innocence.\n\nExhibit \"B\" - The note of Dr. Teodoro S. Lavada to the jail warden.\n\nThis exhibit is offered to show the result of the maltreatment and/or physical injuries inflicted by the [respondents] on the person of [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua - hemoptysis, fever, and body pains - which made the medico-legal officer recommend hospitalization for her.\n\nExhibit \"C\" - The information filed by Fiscal Ricardo F. Tornilla, 2 nd Asst. City Fiscal, Bacolod City, dated July 20, 1982.\n\nThis exhibit is offered to show the result of the [respondents'] confederated efforts for Rosemarie Magbanua to be prosecuted for the crime she did not commit, including untrue affidavits, a biased and false investigation report mentioning Rosemarie Magbanua's alleged confession of her participation in the robbery when she never did, despite the injuries and indignities to which she was subjected, all of which made the Asst. City Fiscal Ricardo F. Tornilla file the information against said plaintiff Rosemarie Magbanua.\n\nExhibit \"D\" - The Decision rendered by Hon. Quirino D. Abad Santos, Jr., Judge, Regional Trial Court of Negros Occidental, Branch XLI Bacolod City, in Criminal Case No. 28 entitled, \"People of the Philippines vs. Rosemarie Magbanua, et al.\" dated December 20, 1985.\n\nExhibit \"D-1\" - The portion appearing on page 4 of said decision stating that, \"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING THEREFORE, this Court finds the evidence for the prosecution not only insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt but even insufficient to establish a prima facie case against her for having participated in the robbery subject of the above entitled case and therefore ACQUITS accused on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.\u00a0 The bailbond of the accused for her provisional liberty is hereby ordered cancelled.\"\n\nThis exhibit with its sub-marking is offered to show that the [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua was acquitted of the crime charged because the evidence for the prosecution was not only insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt but even insufficient to establish a prima facie evidence against her for having participated in the robbery, thus glaringly exposing the utter lack of basis for charging and/or prosecuting Rosemarie Magbanua for the crime of robbery which was nevertheless filed at the behest of the [respondents] who knowing fully the bereftness of their stand even tried to concoct additional evidence of having found still more jewelry in [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua's handbag, a maneuver which was debunked by the honorable Court in its decision.\n\nExhibit \"E\" - The decision of the National Police Commission Adjudication Board No. 11 in Adm. Case No. 83-0888 finding the respondent PFC Ibarra Lopez and respondent Patrolman Juanito Jacela, two of the defendants, guilty of grave misconduct and ordering their suspension for two (2) months without pay.\n\nExhibit \"E-1\" - The bracketed dispositive portion of the decision appearing on page 3 thereof which is as follows:\n\n\"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Board finds respondents PFC IBARRA LOPEZ AND PAT JUANITO JACELA guilty of Misconduct and they are hereby ordered SUSPENDED FOR TWO (2) MONTHS WITHOUT PAY WITH WARNING THAT A REPETITION OF THE SAME OFFENSE SHALL BE PENALIZED MORE SEVERELY.\"\n\nThis exhibit with its submarking is offered to show that the two (2) [respondents], PFC Ibarra Lopez and Patrolman Juanito Jacela, employed unnecessary force on the person of the [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua just to make her admit and/or confess to a crime she did not commit, thus contributing to and even making possible the unnecessary, baseless, and malicious prosecution of the [petitioner]. [26]\nOn 25 January 1991, the RTC issued an Order, [27] admitting Exhibits \"A\" to \"E,\" including the sub-markings thereon for the purposes for which they had been offered and for such purpose as may serve the court a quo in the resolution of the case. [28]\n\nOn 25 July 1995, the RTC rendered a Decision dismissing the Complaint. The RTC applied the established rule that for a malicious prosecution suit to succeed, two indispensable elements must be shown to exist, to wit: (a) malice and (b) absence of probable cause.\u00a0 It found that the elements were not successfully shown by petitioners. It held that the mere filing of a suit does not render a person liable for malicious prosecution should he be unsuccessful for the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate. [29]\n\nIn sustaining the respondents, the RTC said that the filing of the criminal complaint against petitioner Rosemarie was not prompted with a sinister design to vex, or humiliate her.\u00a0 It reasoned that respondent Pilar reported the robbery which occurred on 17 July 1982 to the Bacolod Police Station; consequently, police investigators, including respondents Ibarra and Juanito, proceeded to the residence of respondent Pilar.\u00a0 It ratiocinated that there was no legal malice on the part of the latter as victim of the crime of robbery for bringing the same to the attention of the police authorities.\u00a0 The RTC similarly did not find legal malice on the part of her co-respondents, Ibarra and Juanito, as they were merely performing their duties when they conducted the investigation; and\u00a0 subsequently filed the case against petitioner Rosemarie and her co-accused pursuant thereto.\n\nIn denying petitioners' prayer for damages arising from malicious prosecution, the RTC ruled that:\nIn the course of the investigation, Rosemarie Magbanua admitted her participation in the robbery together with a certain Ernesto Fernandez and a person named \"Gudo.\"\u00a0 The necklace given to her as her share was recovered in her shoulder bag.\n\nAfter the police authorities had completed their investigation, they filed a case for robbery with the office of the City Fiscal of Bacolod City (now City Prosecutor) against Rosemarie Magbanua, Ernesto Fernandez and a certain \"Gudo.\"\u00a0 The Office of the City Fiscal after conducting a preliminary investigation filed a case for robbery against the three suspects.\u00a0 After trial, as against then accused now [herein petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua, the Court acquitted her.\n\n[Herein respondent] Dra. Pilar Junsay, cannot be faulted for reporting to the police.\u00a0 She was robbed of valuables worth P29,974.00.\u00a0 Besides, she did not tell the police that she was robbed by herein [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua.\u00a0 And, there is no legal malice for a victim of a crime to report the matter to the police.\u00a0 Furthermore, the mere filing of a suit does not render a person liable for malicious prosecution should he be unsuccessful for the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate (Albenson Enterprises Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, 217 SCRA 16).\n\nNeither can [respondents] police investigator Ibarra Lopez and Juanito Jacela be faulted for filing a complaint of robbery with the Office of the City Fiscal, against herein plaintiff Rosemarie Magbanua, Ernesto Fernandez and a certain \"Gudo.\"\u00a0 It is part of their duties to conduct an investigation of a case reported to their office.\u00a0 And Rosemarie Magbanua admitted to them her participation to the commission of the crime together with her co-accused Ernesto Fernandez and Gudo.\u00a0 Thus, there was probable cause of the crime of robbery against said accused.\u00a0 Their finding of a probable cause against the accused was shared by the City Fiscal's Office when an Information for robbery against said accused was filed after conducting a preliminary investigation.\n\n[Respondents] police investigators Ibarra Lopez and Juanito Jacela do not know [respondent] Dra.Pilar Junsay nor [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua, prior to July 18, 1982, when the crime was reported by the former to their office.\u00a0 And, the criminal complaint filed by them was not only against Rosemarie Magbanua, but also against Ernesto Fernandez and a certain \"Gudo.\"\u00a0 Hence, it cannot be said that they were prompted by a sinister design to vex, and humiliate [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua. [30]\nPetitioners filed a Notice of Appeal on the 25 July 1995 Decision of the RTC.\u00a0 Thus, the records of the case were subsequently forwarded to the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC in toto.\n\nThe appellate court declared that the design to vex and humiliate petitioner Rosemarie in the prosecution of Criminal Case No. 28 was wanting.\u00a0 It held that respondent Pilar as complaining witness merely reported the matter to the police authorities; while respondents Ibarra and Juanito were merely performing their duties as investigating police officers.\u00a0 Thus:\nIn the present case, there was no proof that the prosecution was prompted by a design to vex and humiliate the [herein petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua.\u00a0 The crime of robbery was actually committed and [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua admitted her participation therein.\u00a0 There was nothing illegal, sinister or malicious in prosecuting her on the part of [herein respondent] Dra. Junsay who, as a victim of the crime of robbery, reported the incident to the police authorities.\u00a0 In fact, the [respondent] did not suspect that the [petitioner] was one of those who committed the crime.\n\nOn the part of the police investigators, they were only performing their duties in accordance with the standard procedure of their office.\u00a0 They came to know the victim Dra. Junsay and [petitioner] Rosemarie Magbanua only during the investigation.\u00a0 The fact was that Rosemarie Magbanua admitted participation in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 Finding that there was a prima facie case, the City Fiscal who investigated the case filed a case for robbery in the then Court of First Instance of Bacolod (now RTC). [31]\nThe Court of Appeals was also convinced that there was probable cause to believe that the robbery was committed by petitioner Rosemarie and her co-accused.\u00a0 The finding of probable cause, according to the appellate court, was confirmed by the filing of the Information for Robbery by the City Fiscal's Office after the preliminary investigation. [32]\n\nThe Court of Appeals disposed:\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the trial court dated July 25, 1995 is hereby AFFIRMED IN TOTO. Costs against the [herein petitioners]. [33]\nHence, petitioners come to the succor of this Court via the instant Appeal by Certiorari to assail the Decision of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Decision of the RTC, that there was no malicious prosecution.\n\nFor our resolution is the issue of whether petitioners are entitled to damages for malicious prosecution. However, before we could resolve said issue, we should first determine whether the filing of a criminal case for Robbery against petitioner Rosemarie constituted malicious prosecution.\n\nIt is petitioners' submission that the prosecution of petitioner Rosemarie was founded upon baseless accusations. [34] Petitioners posit that the charges were based on false affidavits and false police reports, without which the criminal case against petitioner Rosemarie would not have been filed. [35] Petitioners further decry the maltreatment which petitioner Rosemarie allegedly suffered from the hands of respondents.\u00a0 According to petitioners, Rosemarie was maltreated to extract a confession from her, and to make her admit to a crime she did not commit.\u00a0 They reasoned that petitioner Rosemarie, who was then a minor, an uneducated farm girl, and a stranger in Bacolod City, was subjected to torture and inhumane treatment. [36] Petitioners contend further that respondent Pilar employed her privileged status in the society as a medical doctor; and her co-respondents Ibarra and Juanito utilized their positions as members of the Bacolod City Police to secure an admission from petitioner Rosemarie. [37]\n\nIn this jurisdiction, the term \"malicious prosecution\" has been defined as \"an action for damages brought by one against whom a criminal prosecution, civil suit, or other legal proceeding has been instituted maliciously and without probable cause, after the termination of such prosecution, suit, or other proceeding in favor of the defendant therein.\" [38] While generally associated with unfounded criminal actions, the term has been expanded to include unfounded civil suits instituted just to vex and humiliate the defendant despite the absence of a cause of action or probable cause. [39]\n\nThis Court, in Drilon v. Court of Appeals, [40] elucidated, viz :\nThe term malicious prosecution has been defined in various ways.\u00a0 In American jurisdiction, it is defined as:\n\n\"One begun in malice without probable cause to believe the charges can be sustained (Eustace v. Dechter, 28 Cal. App. 2d. 706, 83 P. 2d. 525).\u00a0 Instituted with intention of injuring defendant and without probable cause, and which terminates in favor of the person prosecuted.\u00a0 For this injury an action on the case lies, called the action of malicious prosecution (Hicks v. Brantley, 29 S.E. 459, 102 Ga. 264; Eggett v. Allen, 96 N.W. 803, 119 Wis. 625).\"\nIn Philippine jurisdiction, it has been defined as:\n\"An action for damages brought by one against whom a criminal prosecution, civil suit, or other legal proceeding has been instituted maliciously and without probable cause, after the termination of such prosecution, suit, or other proceeding in favor of the defendant therein.\u00a0 The gist of the action is the putting of legal process in force, regularly, for the mere purpose of vexation or injury (Cabasaan v. Anota, 14169-R, November 19, 1956).\"\n\nThe statutory basis for a civil action for damages for malicious prosecution are found in the provisions of the New Civil Code on Human Relations and on damages particularly Articles 19, 20, 21, 26, 29, 32, 33, 35, 2217 and 2219 (8). To constitute malicious prosecution, however, there must be proof that the prosecution was prompted by a sinister design to vex and humiliate a person, and that it was initiated deliberately by the defendant knowing that his charges were false and groundless.\u00a0 Concededly, the mere act of submitting a case to the authorities for prosecution does not make one liable for malicious prosecution.\nThis Court has drawn the four elements that must be shown to concur to recover damages for malicious prosecution.\u00a0 Therefore, for a malicious prosecution suit to prosper, the plaintiff must prove the following: (1) the prosecution did occur, and the defendant was himself the prosecutor or that he instigated its commencement; (2) the criminal action finally ended with an acquittal; (3) in bringing the action, the prosecutor acted without probable cause; and (4) the prosecution was impelled by legal malice -- an improper or a sinister motive. [41] The gravamen of malicious prosecution is not the filing of a complaint based on the wrong provision of law, but the deliberate initiation of an action with the knowledge that the charges were false and groundless. [42]\n\nWe shall proceed to determine whether in the prosecution of petitioner Rosemarie for the crime of Robbery, all four elements were in attendance.\n\nIt is not disputed that the first and second elements are present.\n\nThe prosecution of petitioner Rosemarie for the crime of robbery did occur, and respondents Pilar, Ibarra and Juanito instigated its commencement.\u00a0 On 20 December 1985, the RTC, Branch XLI, Bacolod City, rendered a Decision acquitting Rosemarie Magbanua on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.\n\nOn the question of probable cause, this Court has ruled that for purposes of malicious prosecution, \"probable cause\" means \"such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief, in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted.\" [43] It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. [44] Thus, a finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction. [45]\n\nAnent the question of whether the prosecutor acted without probable cause in bringing the action against petitioner Rosemarie, we find no reason to depart from the conclusions reached by the RTC and the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 The filing of Criminal Case No. 28 for Robbery was not without probable cause.\n\nIndeed, during the investigation petitioner Rosemarie admitted her participation in the commission of the incident complained of.\u00a0 The investigation report, which prompted the filing of the Information for Robbery against petitioner Rosemarie showed that she admitted to receiving instruction from her co-accused Ernesto Fernandez and a certain Gudo to leave the barrel belt of the kitchen door unlocked, [46] so her co-accused can gain entry to the house of respondent Pilar.\u00a0 Moreover, she admitted that after her co-accused had taken the pieces of jewelry owned by respondent Pilar, they gave her a necklace which she kept in a shoulder bag.\u00a0 During the investigation, she was shown the said necklace, and she positively identified the same to be the necklace her co-accused had given her. [47] On the basis of the said admission, the Office of the Prosecutor found basis and probable cause to file the appropriate Information with the RTC against petitioner Rosemarie and her co-accused Ernesto Fernandez and a certain Gudo.\u00a0 The inadmissibility of the aforesaid admission on the ground that the same was extracted under duress was an evidentiary matter, which does not detract from the fact that based on petitioner Rosemarie's admission, there was reason for the respondents to believe that the suit was not unfounded, and that the crime was committed.\n\nFinally, in an action to recover damages based on malicious prosecution, it must be established that the prosecution was impelled by legal malice.\u00a0 There is necessity of proof that the suit was so patently malicious as to warrant the award of damages under Articles 19 to 21, [48] of the Civil Code, or that the suit was grounded on malice or bad faith. [49] Moreover, it is a doctrine well-entrenched in jurisprudence that the mere act of submitting a case to the authorities for prosecution does not make one liable for malicious prosecution, for the law would not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate. [50]\n\nApplying the rule to the case at bar, we affirm the findings of the RTC and the Court of Appeals that there was no proof of a sinister design on the part of the respondents to vex or humiliate petitioner Rosemarie by instituting the criminal case against her and her co-accused.\u00a0 Respondent Pilar who was robbed of her valuable belongings can only be expected to bring the matter to the authorities.\u00a0 There can be no evil motive that should be attributed to one, who, as victim of a crime institutes the necessary legal proceedings.\u00a0 At the risk of redundancy, we stress that the proscription against the imposition of penalty on the right to litigate must not be violated.\u00a0 Mere filing of a suit does not render a person liable for malicious prosecution should he be unsuccessful, for the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate. [51] There was no other explanation or motive as to why respondents would institute baseless prosecution of petitioner Rosemarie.\u00a0 No evidence was shown that there was bad blood between respondent Pilar and petitioner Rosemarie prior to the supposed robbery.\n\nWe also do not find the actuations of respondents Ibarra and Juanito to be impelled by legal malice.\u00a0 Their commencement of the action against petitioner Rosemarie and her co-accused was pursuant to their duties as police officers.\u00a0 The same was made subsequent to the report of respondent Pilar of the commission of the crime, and the investigation on the person of petitioner Rosemarie.\u00a0 Even then, mistakes committed by a public officer are not actionable absent any clear showing that they were motivated by malice or gross negligence amounting to bad faith, [52] which was not established in the case at bar.\n\nMoreover, as was clear from the outset, the instant case is a suit seeking damages for malicious prosecution, and not for the violations and maltreatment that respondents allegedly committed against petitioner Rosemarie in extracting the admission from her.\u00a0 At any rate, the RTC had ruled that the instant case is not an action on the injuries allegedly suffered by petitioner Rosemarie, but rather for malicious prosecution. Otherwise, an action seeking damages for her injuries should have been deemed prescribed. [53]\n\nWHEREFORE, the Appeal is DENIED .\u00a0 The Decision, dated 26 January 1998, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 51750, which affirmed in toto the Decision, dated 25 July 1995, of the RTC, Branch 51, Bacolod City, in Civil Case No. 4361, is AFFIRMED.

      "title": "JOEL P. GONZALES, JR., PETITIONER, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.DECISION QUISUMBING, J.: For review on certiorari is the Decision[1] dated March 11, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 22157, affirming the guilty verdict against petitioner for arson by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 97.Petitioner Joel P. Gonzales, Jr.[2] was charged in an Information[3] dated July 24, 1997, which read as follows:That on or about the 26th day of June, 1997, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and deliberately set fire to an inhabited place, to wit: a two-storey residential building which [was] partitioned into dwellings rented out to tenants, owned and occupied likewise by CARLOS C. CANLAS, located at No. 120 corner Halcon and Simon Streets, Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, La Loma, Quezon City, thereby setting said residential building into flames and razing it including other properties; and that the properties that were burned with their corresponding owners and value were as follows:1. The residential building and other property owned by Carlos C. Canlas valued at . . . .....P3,000,000.002. Property of Nicasio M. de Jesus valued at . . . ...800,000.003. Property of Andres V. Villaflor valued at . . . ...350,000.004. Property of Gloria V. Lacasandile valued at. . . .350,000.005. Property of Carmen B. Principio valued at . . . ...300,000.006. Property of Dante L. Buri valued at . . . . . . .....185,000.007. Property of Francis F. Simpao valued at . . . . ...170,000.008. Property of Luisito C. Abonita valued at . . . . 150,000.009. Property of Miraflor Saldi Manuel valued at . .. 100,000.0010. Property of Estrella C. Villaflor valued at . . 60,000.00with the total of FIVE MILLION, FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND (P5,465,000.00), all belonging to the aforesaid persons, to the damage and prejudice of said owners in the aforesaid amount of P5,465,000.00, Philippine Currency.CONTRARY TO LAW.On arraignment, the petitioner pleaded not guilty.At the ensuing trial, the prosecution presented eyewitness Carlos C. Canlas, owner of the two-storey building in the corner of Halcon Street and Simon Street, Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, La Loma, Quezon City. He testified that at about 9:30 p.m. on June 26, 1997, he was watching television in his room when his daughter called his attention to check the commotion in an adjacent room. On his way to the room rented by Gonzales, he smelled gas. He saw Gonzales ignite a flame and throw it on a pile of clothes in the middle of the living room where Gonzales had also placed an M-Gas liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tank. Fire quickly spread to the other parts of the building.The prosecution also presented two tenants, Andres V. Villaflor and Francis F. Simpao, as witnesses. Villaflor testified that he heard Gonzales and his aunt quarreling before the fire. He said he heard Gonzales yell \"Susunugin ko itong bahay na ito!\" Alarmed, he went to the Barangay Hall to report the incident but immediately went back to his place when someone informed him his house was on fire. Simpao testified that he saw the fire coming from Gonzales's room. He added that Gonzales was laughing while the building was burning. After the fire was extinguished, the aunt of Gonzales told Simpao that her nephew was to blame.The testimonies were corroborated by Police Officer Alejandro Mendoza, who testified that when he and his fellow officer arrived at the crime scene, Gonzales admitted responsibility for the fire.Gonzales presented a different story. He averred that the fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring. He testified that he was napping inside his room when he was awakened by heat beside his bed. The room was on fire. He shouted for help and Canlas tried to help him but they failed to extinguish it.Gonzales denied he and his aunt were quarreling that evening before the fire started. As his aunt was partly deaf, he said he had to speak in a loud voice. He averred that he merely asked his aunt to buy food because they ran out of M-Gas LPG. Gonzales said that when he met PO1 Mendoza, he explained that he noticed the fire had started in his room. He sought police protection from his neighbors who accused him of starting it.The defense presented as exhibit the Physical Science Report[4] prepared by Police Inspector Grace M. Eustaquio showing that the ashes obtained from the burnt premises were negative of any flammable substance.On May 28, 1998, the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 97 rendered a decision convicting Joel P. Gonzales, Jr. of arson, as follows:WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for twelve (12) years of Prision Mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of Reclusion Temporal as maximum, with full credit for the entire period of preventive imprisonment provided he is qualified therefore (sic) according to Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code. Civil liability not having been proved, the Court cannot grant the same and can only award nominal damages in the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) each to the private complainants who testified, namely, Carlos Canlas, Andres Villaflor and Francis Simpao.SO ORDERED.[5]Gonzales appealed, but the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision. In its Decision dated March 11, 2003, the Court of Appeals held that the denial of Gonzales cannot prevail over the positive identification of a witness. The Court of Appeals also held that the prosecution established circumstantial evidence sufficient to support the conviction of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals noted that although there were discrepancies in the testimony of Canlas and his affidavits, the discrepancies did not necessarily discredit him because affidavits taken ex parte are generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court. Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that the alleged discrepancies pertain to minor matters which negated any suspicion that the testimony was perjured and rehearsed.Gonzales moved for reconsideration but it was denied. Hence, petitioner now raises the following issues for this Court's consideration:IWHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED CORRECTLY IN CONCLUDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED NO SERIOUS REVERSIBLE ERROR OR GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN ITS APPLICATION OF THE PERTINENT RULE AND JURISPRUDENCE WHERE THERE ARE MATERIAL DISCREPANCIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES' STATEMENTS MADE IN THEIR AFFIDAVITS AND THOSE TESTIMONIES GIVEN ON THE WITNESS STAND;IIWHETHER UPON THE AFORESTATED GIVEN SET OF FACTS, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED CORRECTLY IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT'S JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FINDING PETITIONER GUILTY OF THE CHARGE OF ARSON.[6]Stated simply, in our view, the main issue is whether the discrepancies in the affidavit and the court testimonies of a witness are sufficient to exculpate Gonzales of the crime of arson.Petitioner argues that the trial court and the appellate court erred in giving credence to the testimony of prosecution witness Canlas. He claims that the sworn statements of Canlas before the investigating officer of the fire department on June 27, 1997 and before the city prosecutor of Quezon City on July 17, 1997, were inconsistent. Further, petitioner adds that Canlas had testified that he saw petitioner start the fire, but Canlas's testimony on this point was made only for the first time in court. Petitioner points out that in the two prior sworn statements of Canlas, he made no mention of seeing petitioner start the fire. This discrepancy is a material point that ought to cast doubt on the credibility of Canlas. He cites People v. Salik Magonawal,[7] where the material discrepancies between the court testimony and prior statements of a witness at a preliminary investigation made the testimony incredible.Petitioner seeks to discredit the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses for being self-serving and ill-motivated. He avers that both the trial court and the appellate court failed to consider the Physical Science Report which stated that no flammable substance was found in the specimen ashes.Finally, petitioner claims that although he had in the past threatened to burn the house, he never really meant it.In its comment, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) maintains that the findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals should stand because their findings are well supported by the records.The OSG contends that the discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses and their sworn statements were not substantial to warrant a review of the findings of fact of the trial court. The OSG asserts that the testimony of Canlas in court clarified, corroborated and complemented his affidavit. Likewise, the testimony of the other prosecution witnesses corroborated Canlas's testimony.The OSG rebuts petitioner's dependence on the case of People v. Acosta,[8] where the court held that evidence that one did or did not do a certain thing at one time is not admissible to prove that he did or did not do the same or similar thing at another time, but, it may be received to prove a specific intent or knowledge, identity, plan, system, habit, custom or usage.After thoroughly considering the submissions including testimonies and exhibits presented by the parties, we hold that the instant petition lacks merit.The arson committed in the instant case involving an inhabited house or dwelling is covered by Section 3(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1613.[9] In the prosecution for arson, proof of the crime charged is complete where the evidence establishes: (1) the corpus delicti, that is, a fire because of criminal agency; and (2) the identity of the defendant as the one responsible for the crime. In arson, the corpus delicti rule is satisfied by proof of the bare fact of the fire and of it having been intentionally caused. Even the uncorroborated testimony of a single eyewitness, if credible, is enough to prove the corpus delicti and to warrant conviction.[10] When these are present, the only issue is the credibility of the witness. Whenever there is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight considering that affidavits taken ex parte are inferior to testimony in court, the former being almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate,[11] sometimes from partial suggestions and sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for his accurate recollection of the subject.[12]In this case, the eyewitness positively identified Gonzales as the culprit who caused the fire. Both the trial and appellate courts found the testimony of eyewitness Canlas credible. As a general rule, when the findings of both courts are in agreement, this Court will not reverse their findings of fact.Furthermore, in our view, the findings of the Physical Science Report is a negative evidence and taken together with the bare denial of petitioner, supported only with testimonies of relatives, constitute inferior evidence as against the circumstantial evidence coupled with the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the offense by a credible witness.On the damages, we have consistently held that proof is required to determine the reasonable amount of damages that may be awarded to the victims of conflagration. As a rule, therefore, actual or compensatory damages must be proved and not merely alleged.[13] The records do not show concrete proof of the amount of actual damages suffered by each complaining witness. Thus, we cannot grant actual damages. However, we may award nominal and temperate damages.The assessment of nominal damages is left to the discretion of the trial court according to the circumstances of the case. Generally, nominal damages by their nature are small sums fixed by the court without regard to the extent of the harm done to the injured party. However, it is generally held that a nominal damage is a substantial claim, if based upon the violation of a legal right; in such a case, the law presumes damage although actual or compensatory damages are not proven. In truth, nominal damages are damages in name only and not in fact, and are allowed, not as an equivalent of wrong inflicted, but simply in recognition of the existence of a technical injury.[14]Now, temperate damages may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot from the nature of the case be proved with certainty.[15] Under the circumstances, we find it reasonable to award Canlas with P500,000 temperate damages, and to the other complaining witnesses, Simpao and Villaflor, the amount of P100,000 as temperate damages each. In addition, exemplary or corrective damages should be awarded as a way to emphasize that any future conduct of this nature is condemned so as to correct the anti-social behavior that is deleterious in its consequences.[16] Thus, Canlas and the other complaining witnesses, Simpao and Villaflor, should be awarded P50,000 each as exemplary damages.Concerning the penalty to be imposed, Section 3(2) of P.D. No. 1613 prescribes the penalty of reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua. But there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum prison term should be within the range of six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years of prision mayor and the maximum, twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal. Hence, the penalty imposed by the trial court on the accused ought to be modified correspondingly.WHEREFORE, the Decision dated March 11, 2003 of the Court of Appeals sustaining the conviction by the RTC finding the accused-petitioner guilty of the crime of arson of an inhabited dwelling is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS.

GONZALES, JR., PETITIONER, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nFor review on certiorari is the Decision [1] dated March 11, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 22157, affirming the guilty verdict against petitioner for arson by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 97.\n\nPetitioner Joel P. Gonzales, Jr. [2] was charged in an Information [3] dated July 24, 1997, which read as follows:\nThat on or about the 26 th day of June, 1997, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and deliberately set fire to an inhabited place, to wit: a two-storey residential building which [was] partitioned into dwellings rented out to tenants, owned and occupied likewise by CARLOS C. CANLAS, located at No. 120 corner Halcon and Simon Streets, Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, La Loma, Quezon City, thereby setting said residential building into flames and razing it including other properties; and that the properties that were burned with their corresponding owners and value were as follows:\n\n1. The residential building and other property\nowned by Carlos C. Canlas valued at . . . .....P3,000,000.00\n2. Property of Nicasio M. de Jesus valued at . . . ...800,000.00\n3. Property of Andres V. Villaflor\u00a0 valued at\u00a0 . . . ...350,000.00\n4. Property of Gloria V. Lacasandile valued at.\u00a0 . . .350,000.00\n5. Property of Carmen B. Principio valued at . . . ...300,000.00\n6. Property of Dante L. Buri valued at . . .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . . .....185,000.00\n7. Property of Francis F. Simpao valued at . \u00a0. . . ...170,000.00\n8. Property of Luisito C. Abonita valued at . \u00a0. . .\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0150,000.00\n9. Property of Miraflor Saldi Manuel valued at \u00a0\u00a0. .. 100,000.00\n10. Property of Estrella C. Villaflor valued at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0. .\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a060,000.00\n\nwith the total of FIVE MILLION, FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND (P5,465,000.00), all belonging to the aforesaid persons, to the damage and prejudice of said owners in the aforesaid amount of P5,465,000.00, Philippine Currency.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\nOn arraignment, the petitioner pleaded not guilty.\n\nAt the ensuing trial, the prosecution presented eyewitness Carlos C. Canlas, owner of the two-storey building in the corner of Halcon Street and Simon Street, Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, La Loma, Quezon City. \u00a0He testified that at about 9:30 p.m. on June 26, 1997, he was watching television in his room when his daughter called his attention to check the commotion in an adjacent room. \u00a0On his way to the room rented by Gonzales, he smelled gas. \u00a0He saw Gonzales ignite a flame and throw it on a pile of clothes in the middle of the living room where Gonzales had also placed an M-Gas liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tank. Fire quickly spread to the other parts of the building.\n\nThe prosecution also presented two tenants, Andres V. Villaflor and Francis F. Simpao, as witnesses. \u00a0Villaflor testified that he heard Gonzales and his aunt quarreling before the fire. \u00a0He said he heard Gonzales yell \"Susunugin ko itong bahay na ito!\" Alarmed, he went to the Barangay Hall to report the incident but immediately went back to his place when someone informed him his house was on fire. \u00a0Simpao testified that he saw the fire coming from Gonzales's room. \u00a0He added that Gonzales was laughing while the building was burning. \u00a0After the fire was extinguished, the aunt of Gonzales told Simpao that her nephew was to blame.\n\nThe testimonies were corroborated by Police Officer Alejandro Mendoza, who testified that when he and his fellow officer arrived at the crime scene, Gonzales admitted responsibility for the fire.\n\nGonzales presented a different story. \u00a0He averred that the fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring. \u00a0He testified that he was napping inside his room when he was awakened by heat beside his bed. \u00a0The room was on fire. \u00a0He shouted for help and Canlas tried to help him but they failed to extinguish it.\n\nGonzales denied he and his aunt were quarreling that evening before the fire started. \u00a0As his aunt was partly deaf, he said he had to speak in a loud voice.\u00a0 He averred that he merely asked his aunt to buy food because they ran out of M-Gas LPG. \u00a0Gonzales said that when he met PO1 Mendoza, he explained that he noticed the fire had started in his room. \u00a0He sought police protection from his neighbors who accused him of starting it.\n\nThe defense presented as exhibit the Physical Science Report [4] prepared by Police Inspector Grace M. Eustaquio showing that the ashes obtained from the burnt premises were negative of any flammable substance.\n\nOn May 28, 1998, the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 97 rendered a decision convicting Joel P. Gonzales, Jr. of arson, as follows:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for twelve (12) years of Prision Mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of Reclusion Temporal as maximum, with full credit for the entire period of preventive imprisonment provided he is qualified therefore (sic) according to Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code. Civil liability not having been proved, the Court cannot grant the same and can only award nominal damages in the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) each to the private complainants who testified, namely, Carlos Canlas, Andres Villaflor and Francis Simpao.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5]\nGonzales appealed, but the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision. \u00a0In its Decision dated March 11, 2003, the Court of Appeals held that the denial of Gonzales cannot prevail over the positive identification of a witness. \u00a0The Court of Appeals also held that the prosecution established circumstantial evidence sufficient to support the conviction of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. \u00a0The Court of Appeals noted that although there were discrepancies in the testimony of Canlas and his affidavits, the discrepancies did not necessarily discredit him because affidavits taken ex parte are generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court.\u00a0 Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that the alleged discrepancies pertain to minor matters which negated any suspicion that the testimony was perjured and rehearsed.\n\nGonzales moved for reconsideration but it was denied. \u00a0Hence, petitioner now raises the following issues for this Court's consideration:\nI\nWHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED CORRECTLY IN CONCLUDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED NO SERIOUS REVERSIBLE ERROR OR GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN ITS APPLICATION OF THE PERTINENT RULE AND JURISPRUDENCE WHERE THERE ARE MATERIAL DISCREPANCIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES' STATEMENTS MADE IN THEIR AFFIDAVITS AND THOSE TESTIMONIES GIVEN ON THE WITNESS STAND;\n\nII\nWHETHER UPON THE AFORESTATED GIVEN SET OF FACTS, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED CORRECTLY IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT'S JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FINDING PETITIONER GUILTY OF THE CHARGE OF ARSON. [6]\nStated simply, in our view, the main issue is whether the discrepancies in the affidavit and the court testimonies of a witness are sufficient to exculpate Gonzales of the crime of arson.\n\nPetitioner argues that the trial court and the appellate court erred in giving credence to the testimony of prosecution witness Canlas. \u00a0He claims that the sworn statements of Canlas before the investigating officer of the fire department on June 27, 1997 and before the city prosecutor of Quezon City on July 17, 1997, were inconsistent. \u00a0Further, petitioner adds that Canlas had testified that he saw petitioner start the fire, but Canlas's testimony on this point was made only for the first time in court. \u00a0Petitioner points out that in the two prior sworn statements of Canlas, he made no mention of seeing petitioner start the fire. \u00a0This discrepancy is a material point that ought to cast doubt on the credibility of Canlas. \u00a0He cites People v. Salik Magonawal, [7] where the material discrepancies between the court testimony and prior statements of a witness at a preliminary investigation made the testimony incredible.\n\nPetitioner seeks to discredit the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses for being self-serving and ill-motivated. \u00a0He avers that both the trial court and the appellate court failed to consider the Physical Science Report which stated that no flammable substance was found in the specimen ashes.\n\nFinally, petitioner claims that although he had in the past threatened to burn the house, he never really meant it.\n\nIn its comment, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) maintains that the findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals should stand because their findings are well supported by the records.\n\nThe OSG contends that the discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses and their sworn statements were not substantial to warrant a review of the findings of fact of the trial court. \u00a0The OSG asserts that the testimony of Canlas in court clarified, corroborated and complemented his affidavit. \u00a0Likewise, the testimony of the other prosecution witnesses corroborated Canlas's testimony.\n\nThe OSG rebuts petitioner's dependence on the case of People v. Acosta , [8] where the court held that evidence that one did or did not do a certain thing at one time is not admissible to prove that he did or did not do the same or similar thing at another time, but, it may be received to prove a specific intent or knowledge, identity, plan, system, habit, custom or usage.\n\nAfter thoroughly considering the submissions including testimonies and exhibits presented by the parties, we hold that the instant petition lacks merit.\n\nThe arson committed in the instant case involving an inhabited house or dwelling is covered by Section 3(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1613. [9] In the prosecution for arson, proof of the crime charged is complete where the evidence establishes: \u00a0(1) the corpus delicti, that is, a fire because of criminal agency; and (2) the identity of the defendant as the one responsible for the crime. \u00a0In arson, the corpus delicti rule is satisfied by proof of the bare fact of the fire and of it having been intentionally caused.\u00a0 Even the uncorroborated testimony of a single eyewitness, if credible, is enough to prove the corpus delicti and to warrant conviction. [10] When these are present, the only issue is the credibility of the witness. \u00a0Whenever there is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight considering that affidavits taken ex parte are inferior to testimony in court, the former being almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate, [11] sometimes from partial suggestions and sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for his accurate recollection of the subject. [12]\n\nIn this case, the eyewitness positively identified Gonzales as the culprit who caused the fire. \u00a0Both the trial and appellate courts found the testimony of eyewitness Canlas credible.\u00a0 As a general rule, when the findings of both courts are in agreement, this Court will not reverse their findings of fact.\n\nFurthermore, in our view, the findings of the Physical Science Report is a negative evidence and taken together with the bare denial of petitioner, supported only with testimonies of relatives, constitute inferior evidence as against the circumstantial evidence coupled with the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the offense by a credible witness.\n\nOn the damages, we have consistently held that proof is required to determine the reasonable amount of damages that may be awarded to the victims of conflagration. \u00a0As a rule, therefore, actual or compensatory damages must be proved and not merely alleged. [13] The records do not show concrete proof of the amount of actual damages suffered by each complaining witness.\u00a0 Thus, we cannot grant actual damages.\u00a0 However, we may award nominal and temperate damages.\n\nThe assessment of nominal damages is left to the discretion of the trial court according to the circumstances of the case.\u00a0 Generally, nominal damages by their nature are small sums fixed by the court without regard to the extent of the harm done to the injured party.\u00a0 However, it is generally held that a nominal damage is a substantial claim, if based upon the violation of a legal right; in such a case, the law presumes damage although actual or compensatory damages are not proven.\u00a0 In truth, nominal damages are damages in name only and not in fact, and are allowed, not as an equivalent of wrong inflicted, but simply in recognition of the existence of a technical injury. [14]\n\nNow, temperate damages may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot from the nature of the case be proved with certainty. [15] Under the circumstances, we find it reasonable to award Canlas with P500,000 temperate damages, and to the other complaining witnesses, Simpao and Villaflor, the amount of P100,000 as temperate damages each.\u00a0 In addition, exemplary or corrective damages should be awarded as a way to emphasize that any future conduct of this nature is condemned so as to correct the anti-social behavior that is deleterious in its consequences. [16] Thus, Canlas and the other complaining witnesses, Simpao and Villaflor, should be awarded P50,000 each as exemplary damages.\n\nConcerning the penalty to be imposed, Section 3(2) of P.D. No. 1613 prescribes the penalty of reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua. But there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period.\u00a0 Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum prison term should be within the range of six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years of prision mayor and the maximum, twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal .\u00a0 Hence, the penalty imposed by the trial court on the accused ought to be modified correspondingly.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision dated March 11, 2003 of the Court of Appeals sustaining the conviction by the RTC finding the accused-petitioner guilty of the crime of arson of an inhabited dwelling is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. He is hereby sentenced to the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of nine (9) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal as maximum, with full credit for the entire period of preventive imprisonment provided he is qualified therefor according to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nAs to his civil liability, he is ordered to pay temperate damages in the amount of P500,000 to Carlos C. Canlas, the owner of the burnt premises, and P100,000 each to Francis F. Simpao and Andres V. Villaflor, together with exemplary damages of P50,000 to each of them.\u00a0 No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, Carpio-Morales, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 10-16.

TAN & CST ENTERPRISES INC., REPRESENTED BY NELSON G. TAN, PETITIONERS, VS. IBP COMMISSION ON BAR DISCIPLINE AND ATTY. JAIME N. SORIANO, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis petition stemmed from a pending disbarment case before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.\n\nSometime in January of 2002, petitioner Tomas G. Tan (petitioner Tan), stockholder and director of co- petitioner CST Enterprises, Inc. (CST), discovered that two parcels of land owned by the corporation were used to obtain loans from Philippine Business Bank (PBB), with the real estate mortgage annotated at the back of the titles covering the properties. Upon verification, he learned that a certain John Dennis Chua, representing CST, mortgaged the properties. Chua was purportedly authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation as shown by the Corporate Secretary's Certificate dated 04 April 2001 signed by Atty. Jaime N. Soriano (respondent).\n\nOn 28 May 2002, petitioner Tan filed in his personal capacity and as minority stockholder of CST under a derivative action, a letter-complaint with the IBP charging respondent of deceit, malpractice, falsification of public documents, gross misconduct and violation of oath of office. [1] According to petitioners, respondent has never been elected as corporate secretary nor acted as such for CST, and in fact no board meeting was held on 30 March 2001 to so authorize John Dennis Chua because on the said date two of three directors, petitioner Tan and Felipe Chua, were out of the country. Furthermore, John Dennis Chua has never been connected in any capacity with CST, petitioners aver. [2]\n\nPetitioners also filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati a civil case docketed as Civil Case No. 02-299 and captioned as one for \"Declaration of Unenforceability of Promissory Notes and Mortgage, Nullity of Secretary's Certificate, Injunction,\" Damages, etc. with Prayer for Issuance of TRO/ Preliminary Injunction, against respondent, Atty. Stephen Z. Taala and PBB, along with other persons. [3]\n\nIn the course of the proceedings in the said civil case, petitioners claim to have gathered more information and seen the \"extent of the plot or machinations\" of respondent and the participation of other individuals, including Atty. Taala who was the Assistant Vice President for Legal Services of PBB. [4] Atty. Taala had testified in Civil Case No. 02-299 that Felipe Chua personally delivered to him CST's titles to the mortgaged lots and that Felipe Chua assured him that respondent is the Corporate Secretary of CST. [5] Thus, CST's loan application was recommended for favorable consideration.\n\nOn 16 June 2003, petitioners filed with the IBP, Commission on Bar Discipline (Commission) a Motion to Amend/Supplement the Complaint with Motion to Admit Amended/Supplemental Complaint, [6] claiming that respondent and Atty. Taala had facilitated and recommended the approval of the allegedly spurious loans and mortgage entered into by John Dennis Chua. The Commission, however, denied the motion on 28 December 2003 on the ground that the amendments/supplements involve proceedings pending before the trial courts and that the determination of the matters presented belong to said courts which have already acquired jurisdiction over them. [7]\n\nPetitioners sought reconsideration of the order, but the Commission denied the motion, ruling that the Commission cannot make a premature finding on and/or investigation of the alleged acts of Atty. Taala since the same are the subject of a pending civil case. Anent the alleged untruthful statements of respondent, the Commission ruled that there is no need to amend the complaint since the said statements may be refuted in the ensuing proceedings in the case. [8]\n\nAssailing the denial of the motion for the admission of the Amended/Supplemental Complaint, petitioners filed before this Court a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, wherein they impute grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission. Petitioners submit that respondent and Atty. Taala through false testimonies intend to bind CST to the spurious loans and real estate mortgage to its damage and prejudice. [9] They claim that the denial to admit the Amended/Supplemental Complaint would have the effect of preventing petitioners from filing a new complaint against respondent along with Atty. Taala for their conspiratorial illegal acts involving the same loan transactions, as any judgment of the Commission on the original complaint may serve as res judicata to bar judgment on the other acts complained of in the Amended/Supplemental Complaint. [10] Likewise, limiting the facts and issues to those defined in the original complaint would make respondent answerable only for the less serious charges subject of the original complaint but not for the graver charges in the Amended/Supplemental Complaint regarding respondent's untruthful allegations. [11]\n\nIn addition, petitioners claim that respondent's allegations in his Verified Answer are untruthful and perjurious as he knowingly cited untruthful testimonies and affidavits from the records of the civil case with the RTC of Makati. One such untruthful testimony is that of Atty. Taala to the effect that Felipe Chua personally delivered the original titles of the Muntinlupa properties to PBB in compliance with the loan requirements. [12] According to petitioners, Atty. Taala's twin claims that he met with Felipe Chua on 05 April 2001 and that Felipe Chua submitted the Secretary's Certificate on the same date are untruthful since Felipe was out of the country on the said date. Likewise, Felipe Chua could not have attended the meeting with respondent in January 2001 because he was also abroad at that time. [13]\n\nFinally, petitioners aver that the proceeds of the spurious loans amounting to P91.1 Million Pesos covered by the real estate mortgage on CST's real estate properties were funneled to the Mabuhay Sugar Central, Inc., a corporation where respondent is the incorporator, stockholder and President. [14]\n\nPetitioners thus pray of this Court to set aside the Commission's order denying admission of the Amended/Supplemental Complaint, or in the alternative, allow petitioner to file a new complaint against respondent and Atty. Taala based on the same loan transactions. [15]\n\nIn his Comment [16] before the Court, respondent claims that petitioners breached the rule that proceedings against attorneys should be kept private and confidential, when the latter disclosed in Civil Case No. 02-299 the contents of his Verified Answer filed before the Commission, quoting almost verbatim said contents. This had the effect of announcing to the whole world the pending disbarment case, respondent stresses, and is meant to harass and vex him, as well as to damage his reputation even before a final verdict is reached by the Commission. Respondent questions petitioners' motive in not filing a separate case before the IBP against Atty. Taala and accordingly having him tried separately. Finally, respondent posits that the Commission did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's motion to amend its complaint since the nullity or regularity of the mortgage loan in CST's name is not an issue in the administrative case against him.\n\nThe crux of the petition is whether the Commission committed grave abuse of discretion when it denied petitioner's Amended/Supplemental Complaint.\n\nThe Commission did not. The petition must be dismissed.\n\nPetitioners have filed Civil Case No. 02-299, seeking the declaration of unenforceability of promissory notes and mortgage, nullity of secretary's certificate, injunction, damages, and the issuance of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. In the said case, petitioners allege that the loans contracted by CST from PBB were not sanctioned nor ratified by the CST Board of Directors and/ or stockholders, but were only facilitated by respondent and Atty. Taala, as well as by other persons through the use of the spurious Secretary's Certificate. Likewise pending is another case against respondent and John Dennis Chua, et al . for estafa through falsification of public documents, docketed as Criminal Case No. 04-3776 of the RTC of Makati which appears to involve the same allegedly unauthorized mortgage. [17]\n\nThe Court notes that petitioners are seeking similar, if not identical, reliefs from the regular courts and the Commission. Thus, in addition to the prayer to disbar respondent and Atty. Taala, petitioners implore the Commission to make a finding that respondent lawyers be found liable for using untruthful statements under oath, conspiracy to commit estafa, employing deceit and other manipulative acts as well as fraud, and falsification of public documents \u00e2\u201d\u20accharges which are included in his allegations in the civil and criminal cases.\n\nObviously, the Commission is not empowered to resolve matters which are pending resolution by the regular courts to which jurisdiction properly pertains. The IBP, particularly the Commission on Bar Discipline, is merely tasked to investigate and make recommendations on complaints for disbarment, suspension and discipline of lawyers. It is not a regular court and thus is not endowed with the power to investigate and resolve judicial matters pending before the regular courts.\n\nTo cite a specific vital aspect. In the proposed Amended/Supplemental Complaint, petitioners seek to hold respondent administratively liable for his \"untruthful and perjurious\" statements in his Verified Answer in the administrative case. Precisely, however, the truth or falsity of said statements are still to be litigated in the civil case.\n\nDisbarment proceedings are sui generis , they belong to a class of their own, and are distinct from that of civil or criminal actions. [18] To be sure, a finding of liability in a civil case or a conviction in a criminal case is not necessary for finding a member of the bar guilty in an administrative proceeding. However, in the instant case, the civil and criminal cases involving the acts referred to in the proposed amended/supplemental complaint are still pending adjudication before the regular courts. Prudence dictates that the action of the Commission related to the proposed amended/supplemental complaint in the administrative case be sustained in order to avoid contradictory findings in that case and in the court cases. [19]\n\nThe call for judiciousness stems from the need to ensure the smooth and orderly disposition of the related cases pending before the courts and the Commission and avert conflict in the rulings in the bar discipline case and in the judicial cases. Preemption of the regular courts by an administrative case is a worrisome spectacle.\n\nNow we turn to a significant sidelight.\n\nRespondent charges petitioners with divulging what is essentially confidential information, which is a violation of Section 18, [20] Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court. He alleges that petitioners even made the basis of his amended complaint in the civil case the allegations contained in respondent's Verified Answer before the Commission.\n\nA review of the records disclose that petitioners lifted and cited most of the amendatory averments in respondent's Verified Answer in the administrative case as the core of their Amended Complaint in the civil case. In fact, petitioners even identified the Verified Answer and the disbarment proceedings itself as the sources of the averments in the Amended Complaint before the trial court, thus:\n47. On May 28, 2002, disbarment/disciplinary proceedings were filed with the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines against Defendant Soriano for having executed such null and void secretary's certificate, among others. This disbarment case was docketed as CBD Case No. 02-967.\n\n48. The averments of Defendant Soriano in his Verified Answer (\"Soriano Verified Answer\" for brevity) dated September 27, 2002 filed in said disbarment case, as well as the pertinent papers and earlier testimonies in this case and the results of the ongoing investigation and inquiries of Plaintiff Tan, further reveal: x x x. [21] Disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer are private and confidential until its final determination. [22] The confidential nature of the proceedings has a three-fold purpose, to wit: (i) to enable the court and the investigator to make the investigation free from any extraneous influence or interference; (ii) to protect the personal and professional reputation of attorneys from baseless charges of disgruntled, vindictive and irresponsible persons or clients by prohibiting the publication of such charges pending their resolution; and (iii) to deter the press from publishing the charges or proceedings based thereon. [23]\n\nPetitioners had in effect announced to the world the pending disbarment case against respondent. Not only did they disclose the ongoing proceedings, they also divulged most, if not all of the contents of respondent's Verified Answer. Clearly, petitioners' acts impinged on the confidential nature of the disbarment proceedings against Atty. Soriano.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. Petitioners are REMINDED to preserve the confidentiality of the administrative proceedings. The IBP is ordered to resume its hearings in CBD No. 02-267 consistently with this resolution.

RINCIPALIA MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL CONSULTANTS, INCORPORATED, RESPONDENT. DECISION\nREPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION (POEA), PETITIONER, VS. RINCIPALIA MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL CONSULTANTS, INCORPORATED, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nPetitioner assails the September 20, 2004 Resolution [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 86170, dismissing outright the petition for certiorari for failure to attach copies of all relevant pleadings and transcripts of the hearings, as well as the March 29, 2005 Resolution [2] denying the motion for reconsideration.\n\nThis case stemmed from two separate complaints filed before the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) against Principalia Management and Personnel Consultants, Incorporated (Principalia) for violation of the 2002 POEA Rules and Regulations. The first complaint dated July 16, 2003 filed by Ruth Yasmin Concha (Concha) was docketed as POEA Case No. RV 03-07-1497. The second complaint dated October 14, 2003 filed by Rafael E. Baldoza (Baldoza) was docketed as POEA Case No. RV 03-07-1453.\n\nIn the first complaint, Concha alleged that in August 2002, she applied with Principalia for placement and employment as caregiver or physical therapist in the USA or Canada. Despite paying P20,000.00 out of the P150,000.00 fee required by Principalia which was not properly receipted, Principalia failed to deploy Concha for employment abroad. [3]\n\nIn its March 15, 2004 Order, [4] the Adjudication Office of the POEA found Principalia liable for violations of the 2002 POEA Rules and Regulations, particularly for collecting a fee from the applicant before employment was obtained; for non-issuance of official receipt; and for misrepresenting that it was able to secure employment for Concha. For these infractions, Principalia's license was ordered suspended for 12 months or in lieu thereof, Pricipalia is ordered to pay a fine of P120,000.00 and to refund Concha's placement fee of P20,000.00.\n\nBaldoza initiated the second complaint on October 14, 2003 [5] alleging that Principalia assured him of employment in Doha, Qatar as a machine operator with a monthly salary of $450.00. After paying P20,000.00 as placement fee, he departed for Doha, Qatar on May 31, 2003 but when he arrived at the jobsite, he was made to work as welder, a job which he had no skills. He insisted that he was hired as machine operator but the alternative position offered to him was that of helper, which he refused. Thus, he was repatriated on July 5, 2003.\n\nOn November 12, 2003, Baldoza and Principalia entered into a compromise agreement with quitclaim and release whereby the latter agreed to redeploy Baldoza for employment abroad. Principalia, however, failed to deploy Baldoza as agreed hence, in an Order dated April 29, 2004, [6] the POEA suspended Principalia's documentary processing.\n\nPrincipalia moved for reconsideration which the POEA granted on June 25, 2004. [7] The latter lifted its order suspending the documentary processing by Principalia after noting that it exerted efforts to obtain overseas employment for Baldoza within the period stipulated in the settlement agreement but due to Baldoza's lack of qualification, his application was declined by its foreign principal.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 14, 2004, or before the promulgation of POEA's order lifting the suspension, Principalia filed a Complaint [8] (Complaint) against Rosalinda D. Baldoz in her capacity as Administrator of POEA and Atty. Jovencio R. Abara in his capacity as POEA Conciliator, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mandaluyong City for \"Annulment of Order for Suspension of Documentation Processing with Damages and Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction, and a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction .\" Principalia claimed that the suspension of its documentary processing would ruin its reputation and goodwill and would cause the loss of its applicants, employers and principals. Thus, a writ of preliminary injunction and a writ of mandatory injunction must be issued to prevent serious and irreparable damage to it.\n\nOn June 14, 2004, [9] Judge Paulita B. Acosta-Villarante of the RTC of Mandaluyong City, Branch 211, granted a 72-hour restraining order enjoining Administrator Baldoz and Atty. Abara to refrain from imposing the suspension orders before the matter can be heard in full. On June 17, 2004, [10] Judge Rizalina T. Capco-Umali, RTC of Mandaluyong City, Branch 212, held thus:\nWHEREFORE, in order to preserve status quo ANTE, the prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order is hereby GRANTED enjoining the defendant[s] ROSALINDA D. BALDOZ and ATTY. JOVENCIO ABARA, other officers of Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, their subordinates, agents, representatives and all other persons acting for and in their behalf, for (sic) implementing the Orders of Suspension under VC No. LRD 03-100-95 and POEA Case No. RV-03-07-1497.\n\nLet the hearing on Preliminary Injunction and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction be set on June 22, 2004 at 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11]\nAfter the hearing on the preliminary injunction, Administrator Baldoz and Atty. Abara submitted their Memorandum (Memorandum). [12] In an Order dated July 2, 2004, [13] the trial court held that the issue on the application for preliminary mandatory injunction has become moot because POEA had already released the renewal of license of Principalia. However, on the issue against the implementation of the order of suspension, the trial court resolved, to wit:\nAccordingly, the only issue left for the resolution of this Court is whether or not a Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction will lie against the immediate implementation of the Order of Suspension of License of the Plaintiff dated March 15, 2004 under POEA case No. RV-03-07-1497, issued by the POEA Administrator Rosalinda D. Baldoz.\n\nIn support of its Application for a Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction, Plaintiff presented evidence to prove the following:\n\n(1) that it has a license,\n(2) that the said license was renewed,\n(3) the existence of the two (2) suspension orders subject of this case;\n(4) the irreparable damages to the Plaintiff.\n\nThe defendants on the other hand did not present evidence to controvert the evidence of the plaintiff. Instead, defendants submitted a Memorandum.\n\nUpon a careful evaluation and assessment of the evidence by the plaintiff and their respective memoranda of the parties, this Court finds the need to issue the Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction prayed for by the plaintiff.\n\nIt bears stressing that the Order of Suspension dated March 15, 2004 is still pending appeal before the Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment.\n\nIt is likewise significant to point out that the said Order dated March 15, 2004 does not categorically state that the suspension of Plaintiff's License is immediately executory contrary to the contention of the defendants.\n\nCounsel for POEA argued that the basis for the immediate implementation thereof is Section 5, Rule V, Part VI of the 2002 POEA Rules and Regulation, which is quoted hereunder, as follows:\n\"Section 5. Stay of Execution. The decision of the Administration shall be stayed during the pendency of the appeal; Provided that where the penalty imposed carried the maximum penalty of twelve (12) months suspension o[r] cancellation of license, the decision shall be immediately executory despite pendency of the appeal.\"\nThe Order dated March 15, 2004 decreed Plaintiff as having violated Section 2 (a) (d) and (e) of Rule I, Part VI of the POEA Rules and Regulations and the Plaintiffs was imposed the penalty of twelve (12) months suspension of license (or in lieu, to pay fine of P120,000, it being it[s] first offense ).\n\nViolation of Section 2 (a) (d) and (e) Rule I, Part VI of POEA Rules and Regulations imposes a penalty of two (2) months to six (6) months suspension of license for the FIRST offender (sic). And in the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the medium range of the imposable penalty which is four (4) months shall be meted out. Being a first offender, the plaintiff was imposed suspension of license for four (4) months for each violation or an aggregate period of suspension for twelve (12) months for the three (3) violations.\n\nIt was not however made clear in the Order of Suspension dated March 15, 2004 that the Plaintiff's case falls under the EXCEPTION under Section 5 Rule V, Part VI of the 2002 POEA Rules and Regulation, warranting the immediate implementation thereof even if an appeal is pending with the POEA.\n\nThe Plaintiff had established that even if it has been granted a renewal license, but if the same is suspended under the March 15, 2004 Order in POEA case No. RV-03-07-1497, it could not use the license to do business. As earlier mentioned, the said Order is still pending appeal.\n\nIn the meantime that the appeal has not been resolved, Plaintiff's clients/principals will have to look for other agencies here and abroad, to supply their needs for employees and workers. The end result would be a tremendous loss and even closure of its business. More importantly, Plaintiff's reputation would be tarnished and it would be difficult, if not impossible for it to regain its existing clientele if the immediate implementation of the suspension of its license continues.\n\nThe defendants and even the POEA, upon the other hand, will not suffer any damage, if the immediate implementation of the suspension of plaintiff's license as decreed in the March 15, 2004 Order, is enjoined.\n\nWHEREFORE, as prayed for by the Plaintiff, the application for the issuance of the Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction is hereby GRANTED, upon posting of a bond in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php 500,000.00), enjoining and restraining the Defendants ROSALINDA D. BALDOZ and Atty. Jovencio Abarra (sic), other officers of the POEA, their subordinates, agents, representative, and all other persons acting for and in their behalf, from immediately implementing the Order of Suspension dated March 15, 2004 under POEA Case No. RV-03-07-1497.\n\nThe Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction shall be in full force and effect immediately upon receipt thereof and to be carried out on subsequent days thereafter pending the termination of this case and/or unless a contrary Order is issued by this court. [14] (Emphasis supplied)\nThe trial court stressed that it issued the injunctive writ because the order of suspension dated March 15, 2004 is still pending appeal before the Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment; that there is a possibility that Principalia will suffer tremendous losses and even closure of business pending appeal; that POEA will not suffer any damage if the immediate implementation of the suspension of Principalia is enjoined; that the order does not categorically state that the suspension of the license is immediately executory.\n\nPOEA appealed to the Court of Appeals which was dismissed [15] outright for failure of POEA to attach copies of its Memorandum dated June 30, 2004, as well as the transcripts of the hearings conducted on June 22, 2004 and June 29, 2004 as required under Section 3 of Rule 46 of the Rules of Court. POEA's motion for reconsideration was denied [16] hence, this petition on the following grounds:\nI\n\nSECTION 1, RULE 65 OF THE REVISED RULES OF COURT REQUIRES ONLY THAT THE PETITION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY CERTIFIED TRUE COPIES OF THE JUDGMENT, ORDER OR RESOLUTION SUBJECT THEREOF AND OTHER DOCUMENTS RELEVANT AND PERTINENT THERETO. PETITIONER ATTACHED ALL THE DOCUMENTS PERTINENT TO THE PETITION FILED WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS.\n\nII\n\nTHE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT GRANTED RESPONDENT PRICIPALIA'S APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR AND CONVINCING RIGHT TO THE RELIEF DEMANDED.\n\nIII\n\nTHE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT GRANTED RESPONDENT PRINCIPALIA'S APPLICATION DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF PROOF OF IRREPARABLE DAMAGE AS REQUIRED UNDER THE RULES OF COURT.\n\nIV\n\nTHE INJUNCTIVE WRIT ISSUED BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT DOES NOT LIE TO ENJOIN AN ACCOMPLISHED ACT.\n\nV\n\nTHE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTIVE WRIT BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE REVERSAL OF THE PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY OF AN OFFICIAL ACT. [17]\nThe core issues for resolution are as follows: (1) whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari based on purely technical grounds; and (2) whether the trial court erred in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.\n\nPOEA avers that the Court of Appeals' Resolution dismissing outright the petition for certiorari is not valid because the documents attached to the petition substantially informed the Court of Appeals that the trial court gravely abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction. Thus, the attached documents were sufficient to render an independent assessment of its improvident issuance.\n\nWe disagree.\n\nThe Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for certiorari due to POEA's failure to comply with Section 3, Rule 46 and Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court which read as follows:\nRULE 46\n\nSEC. 3. Contents and filing of petition; effect of non-compliance with requirements. -The petition shall contain the full names and actual addresses of all the petitioners and respondents, a concise statement of the matters involved, the factual background of the case, and the grounds relied upon for the relief prayed for.\n\nIn actions filed under Rule 65, the petition shall further indicate the material dates showing when notice of the judgment or final order or resolution subject thereof was received, when a motion for new trial or reconsideration, if any, was filed and when notice of the denial thereof was received.\n\nIt shall be filed in seven (7) clearly legible copies together with proof of service thereof on the respondent with the original copy intended for the court indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order, resolution, or ruling subject thereof, such material portions of the record as are referred to therein, and other documents relevant or pertinent thereto. The certification shall be accomplished by the proper clerk of court or by his duly authorized representative, or by the proper officer of the court, tribunal, agency or office involved or by his duly authorized representative. The other requisite number of copies of the petition shall be accompanied by clearly legible plain copies of all documents attached to the original.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nRULE 65\n\nSECTION. 1. Petition for certiorari. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.\n\nThe petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof, copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a sworn certification of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of Section 3, Rule 46.\nIn the case at bar, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for certiorari due to POEA's failure to attach the following relevant documents: (1) the Memorandum filed by POEA in the trial court to oppose the Complaint; and (2) the transcripts of stenographic notes (TSN) of the hearings conducted by the trial court on June 22, 2004 and June 29, 2004. In its motion for reconsideration dated October 13, 2004, [18] POEA only attached the TSN dated June 30, 2004, [19] with the explanation that the trial court did not furnish it with copies of the other hearings. However, we note that POEA still failed to attach a copy of the Memorandum which the Court of Appeals deemed essential in its determination of the propriety of the trial court's issuance of the writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction.\n\nThe allowance of the petition on the ground of substantial compliance with the Rules is not a novel occurrence in our jurisdiction. [20] Indeed, if we apply the Rules strictly, we cannot fault the Court of Appeals for dismissing the petition [21] because the POEA did not demonstrate willingness to comply with the requirements set by the rules and to submit the necessary documents which the Court of Appeals need to have a proper perspective of the case.\n\nPOEA avers that the trial court gravely abused its discretion in granting the writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction when the requirements to issue the same have not been met. It asserts that Principalia had no clear and convincing right to the relief demanded as it had no proof of irreparable damage as required under the Rules of Court.\n\nWe do not agree.\n\nThe trial court did not decree that the POEA, as the granting authority of Principalia's license to recruit, is not allowed to determine Principalia's compliance with the conditions for the grant, as POEA would have us believe. For all intents and purposes, POEA can determine whether the licensee has complied with the requirements. In this instance, the trial court observed that the Order of Suspension dated March 15, 2004 was pending appeal with the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Thus, until such time that the appeal is resolved with finality by the DOLE, Principalia has a clear and convincing right to operate as a recruitment agency.\n\nFurthermore, irreparable damage was duly proven by Principalia. Suspension of its license is not easily quantifiable nor is it susceptible to simple mathematical computation, as alleged by POEA. The trial court in its Order stated, thus:\nIn the meantime that the appeal has not been resolved, Plaintiff's clients/principals will have to look for other agencies here and abroad, to supply their needs for employees and workers. The end result would be a tremendous loss and even closure of its business. More importantly, Plaintiff's reputation would be tarnished and it would be difficult, if not impossible for it to regain its existing clientele if the immediate implementation of the suspension of its license continues. [22]\nIf the injunctive writ was not granted, Principalia would have been labeled as an untrustworthy recruitment agency before there could be any final adjudication of its case by the DOLE. It would have lost both its employer-clients and its prospective Filipino-applicants. Loss of the former due to a tarnished reputation is not quantifiable.\n\nMoreover, POEA would have no authority to exercise its regulatory functions over Principalia because the matter had already been brought to the jurisdiction of the DOLE. Principalia has been granted the license to recruit and process documents for Filipinos interested to work abroad. Thus, POEA's action of suspending Principalia's license before final adjudication by the DOLE would be premature and would amount to a violation of the latter's right to recruit and deploy workers.\n\nFinally, the presumption of regular performance of duty by the POEA under Section 3 (m), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, finds no application in the case at bar, as it applies only where a duty is imposed on an official to act in a certain way, and assumes that the law tells him what his duties are. Therefore the presumption that an officer will discharge his duties according to law does not apply where his duties are not specified by law and he is given unlimited discretion. [23] The issue threshed out before the trial court was whether the order of suspension should be implemented pending appeal. It did not correct a ministerial duty of the POEA. As such, the presumption on the regularity of performance of duty does not apply.\n\nWHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ . concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 43-44.

JOHNNY ALANO, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nSANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:\n\nFor our resolution is a petition for review on certiorari [1] assailing the Decision [2] dated April 30, 2001 and Resolution [3] dated July 18, 2001 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 54967, entitled \u201cJohnny Alano v. Fact-Finding and Intelligence Bureau (Office of the Ombudsman), represented by Director Agapito B. Rosales.\u201d\n\nThe facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, disclose that Johnny Alano, respondent herein, is a train engineer of the Philippine National Railways (PNR). On August 22, 1996, at past 6:00 o\u2019clock in the morning, he was steering a PNR train along the South Superhighway PNR railway, Makati City.\u00a0 \u00a0Upon reaching the Magallanes Interchange (underneath the overpass), the train rammed the rear portion of a school bus driven by Clemente Alfaro, then crossing the railroad tract. \u00a0\u00a0As a result of the incident, Aaron John L. Zarate, one of the students on board the school bus, died, while some of his co-passengers sustained injuries.\n\nOn October 29, 1996, Atty. Jeffrey-John L. Zarate, brother of the deceased student, wrote a letter-complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman, petitioner herein, charging the \u201cofficers and employees of the PNR responsible for the accident.\u201d Petitioner endorsed the letter to its Fact-Finding and Intelligence Bureau (FFIB) which conducted an investigation. Thereafter, the FFIB filed with the Administrative Adjudication Bureau (AAB), also under the office of petitioner, an administrative complaint against respondent and Jose Dado, PNR General Manager, and Bonaparte C. Roque, PNR Manager, Train and Station Department, docketed as OMB-ADM-0-97-0605.\u00a0 \u00a0The three were charged with gross neglect of duty, inefficiency, and incompetence in the performance of official duties for having failed to take the necessary precautionary measures in preventing accidents of such nature.\n\nUpon recommendation of the AAB, then Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto, in a Resolution [4] dated August 14, 1998, exonerated all respondents and dismissed the administrative complaint against them. He found that the accident was not due to respondents\u2019 negligence; that the place of the accident was not intended for public use, particularly by motorists; and that complainant Atty. Jeffrey-John Zarate himself, in his statement given to SPO2 Mario Ocampo on August 22, 1996, blamed the school bus driver for being negligent as the latter should not have traversed the area where the accident took place. The Ombudsman then concluded that \u201ccomplainant miserably failed to prove that the cause of the accident was attributable to the alleged negligence, incompetence and inefficiency of the respondents.\u201d\n\nThis prompted Atty. Zarate to file a motion for reconsideration. In his Order [5] dated March 17, 1999, then Ombudsman Aniano Desierto modified his August 14, 1998 Resolution in the sense that, while maintaining his finding that the accident was caused by the negligence of the school bus driver, respondent should nonetheless be held guilty of \u201cmisconduct\u201d for \u201cfailing to stop the train immediately after the collision to render assistance to the victims.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Thus, respondent was meted the penalty of suspension from the service for 6 months without pay.\n\nRespondent filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied in an Order dated August 12, 1999.\n\nAggrieved, respondent filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 54967. In its Decision dated April 30, 2001, the appellate court granted the petition and nullified petitioner\u2019s Orders of March 17 and August 12, 1999 suspending\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0respondent for 6 months for misconduct. \u00a0It held that petitioner\u2019s Resolution dated August 14, 1998, exonerating respondent of the administrative charge, is final and unappealable , hence, can no longer be modified or reversed, pursuant to Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 issued by the Ombudsman.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution dated July 18, 2001.\n\nHence, the instant petition for review on certiorari.\n\nPetitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in annulling then Ombudsman Desierto\u2019s Orders of March 17 and August 12, 1999 modifying his Resolution of August 14, 1998 exonerating respondent, considering that Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 allows the filing of a motion for reconsideration of the Ombudsman\u2019s decision or resolution dismissing an administrative case.\n\nOn the other hand, respondent, in his comment, prays that the petition be dismissed for being unmeritorious.\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nSection 13(8), Article XI of the 1987 Constitution empowers the Office of the Ombudsman to, among others, \u201cpromulgate its rules of procedure and exercise such other powers or perform such functions or duties as may be provided by law.\u201d Pursuant to such constitutional authority vested in the Office of the Ombudsman to promulgate its rules of procedure, Administrative Order No. 07 (otherwise known as the \u201cRules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman\u201d) dated April 10, 1990 was issued. Section 7, Rule III thereof provides:\nSEC. 7. Finality of decision. \u2013 Where the respondent is absolved of the charge, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary, the decision shall be final and unappealable. In all other cases, the decision shall become final after the expiration of ten (10) days from receipt thereof by the respondent, unless a motion for reconsideration or petition for certiorari shall have been filed by him as prescribed in Section 27 of RA 6770. \u00a0(Underscoring supplied) Moreover, Section 27 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6770 (otherwise known as \u201cThe Ombudsman Act of 1989\u201d) provides:\nSEC. 27. Effectivity and Finality of Decisions. \u2013 (1) All provisionary orders of the Office of the Ombudsman are immediately effective and executory.\n\nA motion for reconsideration of any order, directive or decision of the Office of the Ombudsman must be filed within five (5) days after receipt of written notice and shall be entertained only on any of the following grounds:\n\n(1)\u00a0 New evidence has been discovered which materially affects the order, directive or decision;\n\n(2) \u00a0\u00a0Errors of law or irregularities have been committed prejudicial to the interest of the movant.\u00a0 The motion for reconsideration shall be resolved within three (3) days from filing: Provided, That only one motion for reconsideration shall be entertained.\n\nFindings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman, when supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. Any order, directive or decision imposing the penalty of public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month\u2019s salary shall be final and unappealable.\n\nx x x\n\nThe above rules may be amended or modified by the office of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Ombudsman as the interest of justice may require. (Underscoring supplied) From the above constitutional and statutory provisions and Rule, there are two instances where a decision, resolution or order of the Ombudsman becomes final and unappealable: (1) where the respondent is absolved of the charge; and (2) in case of conviction, where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary.\n\nIn the instant case, petitioner, in its Resolution dated August 14, 1998, exonerated respondent of the administrative charge.\u00a0 It is implicit in \u00a0Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 and Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 that a decision absolving or exonerating respondent of the charge is final and unappealable, [6] meaning, immediately executory . [7] In Alba v. Nitorreda, [8] we upheld the validity of the provisions of Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 and Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 providing for the immediate finality and non-appealability of the decisions, orders, resolutions, or directives of the Ombudsman in certain cases and declaring that such provisions do not infringe on the due process clause, for the right of appeal is not a natural right, nor a part of due process; it is merely a statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner provided by law. [9]\n\nIn sum, petitioner, by issuing its Orders dated March 17 and August 12, 1999 modifying its final and immediately executory Resolution of August 14, 1998 exonerating respondent, committed a reversible error.\n\nWHEREFORE, we DENY the instant petition.\u00a0 The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

ROLANDO RAMOS, EUSEBIO I. RAMOS AND EVANGELISTO GARCIA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nThis petition assails the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated February 16, 2005 in CA-G.R. CV No. 58644 reversing the Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Roxas, Isabela, Branch 23, dated July 17, 1996, in Civil Case No. Br. 23-357 which ruled that herein petitioner Zenaida Ramos-Balalio had a superior right to possess Lot No. 204, Pls-15, situated at Mu\u00f1oz, Roxas, Isabela, as well as its Resolution [3] dated June 14, 2005 denying the motion for reconsideration.\n\nAs culled from the records, petitioner Zenaida and her brother Alexander (now deceased) are the children of spouses Susana Bueno and Abundio Ramos. The spouses started occupying Lot No. 204 in 1938. Abundio died in 1944. Susana met her second husband, respondent Eusebio Ramos in 1946, with whom she had five children, one of whom is respondent Rolando.\n\nIn the interim, prior to 1958, Susana discovered that Felimon Domingo applied for a sales patent over the subject parcel of land which she opposed. The Bureau of Lands resolved the dispute, thus:\nIn the light of the foregoing facts, it is clear that Felimon B. Domingo has not entered, possessed or cultivated the land in question and therefore he has not acquired any preference right thereto. Upon the other hand contestant Susana Bueno Vda. de Ramos and her children have sufficiently established their right of preference over the land except the one hectare Cemetery site, on the basis of their continuous occupation and cultivation and their valuable improvements introduced thereon.\n\nWherefore, it is ordered that the Sales Application No. 21992 of Felimon B. Domingo be as hereby it is rejected, forfeiting in favor of the Government whatever amount have been paid on account thereof. The land in question shall be subdivided so as to exclude therefrom the one hectare portion in the northwestern part of the land, which shall be reserved as barrio cemetery site, while the remaining area is hereby allocated to SUSANA BUENO VDA DE RAMOS who shall file an appropriate application therefore within sixty (60) days after the survey thereof at her own expense, it not appearing that this Office has received the homestead (new) application allegedly filed by her for the same land.\n\nSO ORDERED. [4] It was alleged that as Susana accompanied her husband Eusebio, a soldier, wherever he was assigned, Susana's father, George Bueno, and daughter, petitioner Zenaida continued the cultivation and possession of the subject land. Sometime later, Susana sold the land to petitioner who, in turn, partitioned it among herself, her brother, Alexander, and respondent Rolando and his siblings. The partition was not registered but Deeds of Sale were executed in favor of Rolando and Alexander.\n\nPetitioner thereafter mortgaged her share; however, it came to her knowledge that respondents Rolando and Eusebio had usurped her share and deprived the mortgagees of possession over the land. After settling the mortgage, petitioner filed a case for recovery of inheritance, possession and damages with a petition for preliminary mandatory injunction.\n\nThe trial court had the land surveyed. Subdividing the land into Lots 204-A to 204-H [5] based on the actual possessor or occupant, the survey plan revealed the following:\nPlaintiff Zenaida Ramos Balalio has no possession, occupation, and cultivation whatsoever of lot 204, Pls-15;\n\nRolando Ramos is in possession and cultivation of lot 204-F, lot 204-G and lot 204-C, with a total area of 43,957 sq. m., more or less;\n\nEusebio Ramos is occupying and cultivating lot 204-A with an area of 4,994 sq. m., more or less;\n\nLot 204-B consisting of 17,685 sq. m., more or less, is possessed and cultivated by Evangelisto Garcia, another intervenor. His occupation is very much less than the two (2) hectares sold to him by Alexander Ramos. It is short by 2,311 sq. m., more or less;\n\nThe total area of the land in question, after deducting one (1) hectare occupied by the cemetery is 73,150 sq. m., more or less. [6] On July 17, 1996, the trial court rendered its decision holding that petitioner was deprived of her right to cultivation and possession of her share of Lot No. 204 and thus ruled:\nAS A CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THE FOREGOING , judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff, Zenaida Ramos and against Rolando Ramos, defendant, and Eusebio Ramos, intervenor.\nOrdering Eusebio Ramos to vacate lot 204-A and surrender it to Evangelisto Garcia because he is not entitled to any portion of the lot in question, it being the conjugal property of the first marriage of Susana Bueno to Abundio Ramos;\n\nEvangelisto Garcia is adjudicated the first two (2) hectares from the North and East of the cemetery, as he validly bought the area from Alexander Ramos. He is presently occupying only 17,689 sq. m., more or less. His possession now is increased to two (2) hectares which includes the area being possessed by Eusebio Ramos;\n\nThe remaining portion of the share of Alexander Ramos is 4,410 sq. m., more or less. This is adjudicated in favor of his heirs. This portion now corresponds to the area immediately South of the area of Evangelisto Garcia, the partition being from East to West;\n\nThe middle portion consisting of 24,410 sq. m., more or less, and immediately South of the cemetery, and also South of the portion adjudicated to the heirs of Alexander is now given to Zenaida Ramos Balalio as her valid share of lot 204, the partition being also East to West;\n\nSouth of the share of Zenaida consisting also of 24,410 sq. m., more or less, is the valid share of Rolando Ramos and his full blooded brother and sisters namely Robin, Corazon, Myrna and Mila, all surnamed Ramos;\n\nRolando Ramos and Eusebio Ramos are ordered jointly and severally to pay Zenaida Ramos:\n\nThousand (P10,000.00) Pesos as attorney's fees;\nOne thousand Five Hundred (P1,500.00) Pesos as appearance fees of her lawyer;\nTen Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos as incidental expenses relative to the case;\nOne Hundred Thousand Eight Hundred (P100,800.00) Pesos as the reasonable owner's share of the produce of the land of Zenaida Ramos from 1975 to the present, with an interest of 6% per annum until fully paid;\n\nThe Clerk of Court and the Sheriff are ordered to repair to the land in question and partition said land in accordance with the tenor of this decision;\n\nAnd to pay the cost.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7]\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals found that neither Zenaida nor Alexander complied with the homestead application requirements in order to acquire superior vested right. As a consequence, it reversed the decision of the trial court, to wit:\nAs a consequence of the foregoing, the Court rules in favor of appellants as to the fourth error and finds that the contract supposedly dividing that property among Zenaida, Rolando Ramos and Alexander Ramos cannot be enforced because neither of the parties therein can claim any vested right over the subject parcel land which is still part of the public domain.\n\nAlso, prescinding from the above ruling, the intervention of Eusebio Ramos and Evangelisto Garcia should likewise be dismissed. As to Eusebio, since Susana never filed an application for homestead, her right never ripened to ownership which she could have transmitted to her heirs. As to Evangelisto Garcia who supposedly purchased that share of Alexander (an heir of Susana), since the vendor never inherited anything from Susana there was nothing which he (Evangelisto) could have bought. In fine, neither of the intervenors could claim any right which they can enforce in court.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Roxas, Isabela, Branch 23, in Civil Case No. Br. 23-357 is REVERSED and the \"Complaint\" filed by plaintiff-appellee as well as the respective \"Answer in Intervention\" of Eusebio Ramos and Evangelisto Garcia are all hereby ordered DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8] Hence, this petition on the following assigned errors:\n7.1. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN REVERSING THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION AND DISMISSING THE PETITIONER'S COMPLAINT.\n\n7.2. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER IS NOT IN PRIOR POSSESSION OF THE SAID LAND, AND DECLARING THAT SHE HAS NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER TO THE DISPUTED LAND.\n\n7.3. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN IGNORING THE ISSUE OF ACCION PUBLICIANA IN THE CASE AT BAR AND CONFINED ITSELF TO THE CLAIM OF RECOVERY OF INHERITANCE. [9] The petition is partly meritorious.\n\nUnder the Regalian doctrine, all lands of the public domain belong to the State and those lands not appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State. [10] Lands of the public domain are classified into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks. Alienable lands of the public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands. [11]\n\nCommonwealth Act No. 141 (1936), or the Public Land Act, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1073 (1977), remains to be the general law governing the classification and disposition of alienable lands of the public domain. It enumerates the different modes of acquisition of these lands and prescribes the terms and conditions to enable private persons to perfect their title to them. It is, therefore, the applicable law to the case before us.\n\nA homestead patent, such as the subject of the instant case, is one of the modes to acquire title to public lands suitable for agricultural purposes. Under the Public Land Act, a homestead patent is one issued to any citizen of this country, over the age of 18 years or the head of a family, and who is not the owner of more than 24 [12] hectares of land in the country. [13] To be qualified, the applicant must show that he has resided continuously for at least one year in the municipality where the land is situated and must have cultivated at least one-fifth of the land applied for. [14]\n\nIn the case at bar, petitioner Zenaida asserts her right to a parcel of agricultural land that her parents Susana and Abundio had possessed since 1938. She claims that, for some time, the cultivation of this land was left to her and her grandfather and that, following the death of her father Abundio, the land was allegedly sold to her by her mother Susana.\n\nZenaida's argument is flawed because it assumes that her parents had perfected their title over the land and that they could validly convey the same to third persons, whether by sale or by inheritance. However, a careful examination of the records shows that petitioner has not satisfactorily established that a valid application for homestead patent was filed by her parents. The decision of the Bureau of Lands in 1958 only addressed Zenaida's family's right of preference over the land, in view of their possession and cultivation of the land. Nonetheless, the Bureau of Lands ordered the filing of an appropriate application for its registration which indicates that as of that time, there was as yet no valid application filed. [15]\n\nThe purported sale, therefore, between petitioner and her mother cannot be given effect, nor can it be a source of right for Zenaida, because Susana did not have the authority to sell what did not belong to her. The invalidation of the sale consequently nullifies the partition of the property among Zenaida, Alexander, and Rolando and his siblings because Zenaida could not have disposed of the land which she did not own.\n\nFor the same reason, neither Eusebio nor Rolando can claim any right whatsoever as heirs of Susana. Their claim evidently relies on the provision of the Public Land Act which states:\nSection 105. If at any time the applicant or grantee shall die before the issuance of the patent or the final grant of the land, or during the life of the lease, or while the applicant or grantee still has obligations pending towards the Government, in accordance with this Act, he shall be succeeded in his rights and obligations with respect to the land applied for or granted or leased under this Act by his heirs in law, who shall be entitled to have issued to them the patent or final concession if they show that they have complied with the requirements therefor, and who shall be subrogated in all his rights and obligations for the purposes of this Act. (Emphasis added) The reliance is misplaced because the cited provision speaks of an applicant, grantee , or lessee . Susana was not one of these. In her lifetime, despite her possession and cultivation of the land, she failed to apply for a homestead patent and to acquire any vested right that Eusebio or Rolando can inherit. As such, the land remains part of the public domain. Furthermore, Eusebio and Rolando cannot invoke their prior possession and occupation of the land because the same cannot be considered as adverse, open, public, peaceful and to the exclusion of all.\n\nHence, the subject land remains to be part of the public domain and rightfully belongs to the State. As held by the Court of Appeals, none of the parties obtained a defensible title to the property which can be upheld by the Court. Nonetheless, the possession of the land is different from the issue of its ownership . Petitioner argues that her petition may be treated as an accion publiciana and not merely an action for recovery of inheritance.\n\nAn accion publiciana is an action for the recovery of the right to possess and is a plenary action in an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession of realty independently of title. [16] In this case, the issue is whether Zenaida, as an applicant for public land, may be considered as having any right to the land occupied, which may entitle her to sue in courts for the return of the possession thereof.\n\nWe find that Zenaida has proven prior possession of the portion of land she claims as her share, which possession antedates the filing of the homestead application. She produced evidence showing that she has filed a verified application for the registration of the land with the Bureau of Lands on August 10, 1971, [17] which is still pending. The documents remain uncontested and the application has not been assailed by any of the parties to the case. She alleged that during the lifetime of her mother, she and her maternal grandfather cultivated and occupied the land.\n\nMoreover, Zenaida presented tax declarations both in her name and that of her predecessor-in-interest (mother Susana Bueno) covering the property. Time and again, we have held that although tax declarations or realty tax payments of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, nevertheless, they are good indicia of possession in the concept of owner for no one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his actual or at least constructive possession. [18] They constitute at least proof that the holder has a claim of title over the property. The voluntary declaration of a piece of property for taxation purposes manifests not only one's sincere and honest desire to obtain title to the property and announces his adverse claim against the State and all other interested parties, but also the intention to contribute needed revenues to the Government. [19]\n\nAll told, petitioner Zenaida's uncontested and verified application for a homestead patent coupled with her open and notorious occupation of the land convinces us of her preferential right to possess the land claimed, which entitles her to be protected by the law in such possession.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED . The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 16, 2005 is MODIFIED, insofar as to grant petitioner Zenaida Ramos-Balalio preferential possession of the portion of Lot 204, Pls-15, situated in Mu\u00f1oz, Roxas, Isabela, as delineated in the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Roxas, Isabela, Branch 23, dated July 17, 1996.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr. , and Chico-Nazario, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 29-40.

NO. 162015, March 06, 2006 ]\n\nTHE CITY GOVERNMENT OF QUEZON CITY, AND THE CITY TREASURER OF QUEZON CITY, DR. VICTOR B. ENRIGA, PETITIONERS, VS. BAYAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nTHE CITY GOVERNMENT OF QUEZON CITY, AND THE CITY TREASURER OF QUEZON CITY, DR. VICTOR B. ENRIGA, PETITIONERS, VS. BAYAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nBefore the Court, on pure questions of law , is this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to nullify and set aside the following issuances of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 227, in its Civil Case No. Q-02-47292 , to wit:\n1) Decision [1] dated June 6, 2003 , declaring respondent Bayan Telecommunications, Inc. exempt from real estate taxation on its real properties located in Quezon City; and\n\n2) Order [2] dated December 30, 2003 , denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\nThe facts:\n\nRespondent Bayan Telecommunications, Inc. [3] (Bayantel) is a legislative franchise holder under Republic Act (Rep. Act) No. 3259 [4] to establish and operate radio stations for domestic telecommunications, radiophone, broadcasting and telecasting.\n\nOf relevance to this controversy is the tax provision of Rep. Act No. 3259, embodied in Section 14 thereof, which reads:\nSECTION 14. (a) The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings and personal property, e xclusive of the franchise , as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay. (b) The grantee shall further pay to the Treasurer of the Philippines each year, within ten days after the audit and approval of the accounts as prescribed in this Act, one and one-half per centum of all gross receipts from the business transacted under this franchise by the said grantee (Emphasis supplied)\nOn January 1, 1992 , Rep. Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the \" Local Government Code of 1991 \" (LGC), took effect. Section 232 of the Code grants local government units within the Metro Manila Area the power to levy tax on real properties, thus:\nSEC. 232. \u2014 Power to Levy Real Property Tax. \u2014 A province or city or a municipality within the Metropolitan Manila Area may levy an annual ad valorem tax on real property such as land, building, machinery and other improvements not hereinafter specifically exempted.\nComplementing the aforequoted provision is the second paragraph of Section 234 of the same Code which withdrew any exemption from realty tax heretofore granted to or enjoyed by all persons, natural or juridical, to wit:\nSEC. 234 \u2014 Exemptions from Real Property Tax. The following are exempted from payment of the real property tax:\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 xxx\n\nExcept as provided herein, any exemption from payment of real property tax previously granted to, or enjoyed by, all persons, whether natural or juridical, including government-owned-or-controlled corporations is hereby withdrawn upon effectivity of this Code (Emphasis supplied).\nOn July 20, 1992, barely few months after the LGC took effect, Congress enacted Rep. Act No. 7633, amending Bayantel's original franchise. The amendatory law (Rep. Act No. 7633) contained the following tax provision:\nSEC. 11. The grantee, its successors or assigns shall be liable to pay the same taxes on their real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of this franchise , as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay. In addition thereto, the grantee, its successors or assigns shall pay a franchise tax equivalent to three percent (3%) of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications businesses transacted under this franchise by the grantee, its successors or assigns and the said percentage shall be in lieu of all taxes on this franchise or earnings thereof. Provided, That the grantee, its successors or assigns shall continue to be liable for income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code .... xxx. [Emphasis supplied]\nIt is undisputed that within the territorial boundary of Quezon City, Bayantel owned several real properties on which it maintained various telecommunications facilities. These real properties, as hereunder described, are covered by the following tax declarations:\n(a) Tax Declaration Nos. D-096-04071, D-096-04074, D-096-04072 and D-096-04073 pertaining to Bayantel's Head Office and Operations Center in Roosevelt St., San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City allegedly the nerve center of petitioner's telecommunications franchise operations, said Operation Center housing mainly petitioner's Network Operations Group and switching, transmission and related equipment;\n\n(b) Tax Declaration Nos. D-124-01013, D-124-00939, D-124-00920 and D-124-00941 covering Bayantel's land, building and equipment in Maginhawa St., Barangay East Teacher's Village, Quezon City which houses telecommunications facilities; and\n\n(c) Tax Declaration Nos. D-011-10809, D-011-10810, D-011-10811, and D-011-11540 referring to Bayantel's Exchange Center located in Proj. 8, Brgy. Bahay Toro, Tandang Sora, Quezon City which houses the Network Operations Group and cover switching, transmission and other related equipment.\nIn 1993, the government of Quezon City, pursuant to the taxing power vested on local government units by Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, infra , in relation to Section 232 of the LGC, supra , enacted City Ordinance No. SP-91, S-93, otherwise known as the Quezon City Revenue Code (QCRC), [5] imposing, under Section 5 thereof, a real property tax on all real properties in Quezon City, and, reiterating in its Section 6, the withdrawal of exemption from real property tax under Section 234 of the LGC, supra . Furthermore, much like the LGC, the QCRC, under its Section 230, withdrew tax exemption privileges in general, as follows:\nSEC. 230. Withdrawal of Tax Exemption Privileges . \u2014 Unless otherwise provided in this Code, tax exemptions or incentives granted to, or presently enjoyed by all persons, whether natural or juridical, including government owned or controlled corporations, except local water districts, cooperatives duly registered under RA 6938, non-stock and non-profit hospitals and educational institutions, business enterprises certified by the Board of Investments (BOI) as pioneer or non-pioneer for a period of six (6) and four (4) years, respectively, ... are hereby withdrawn effective upon approval of this Code (Emphasis supplied).\nConformably with the City's Revenue Code, new tax declarations for Bayantel's real properties in Quezon City were issued by the City Assessor and were received by Bayantel on August 13, 1998, except one (Tax Declaration No. 124-01013) which was received on July 14, 1999.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 16, 1995, Rep. Act No. 7925, [6] otherwise known as the \"Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines,\" envisaged to level the playing field among telecommunications companies, took effect. Section 23 of the Act provides:\nSEC. 23. Equality of Treatment in the Telecommunications Industry. \u2014 Any advantage, favor, privilege, exemption, or immunity granted under existing franchises, or may hereafter be granted, shall ipso facto become part of previously granted telecommunications franchises and shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the grantees of such franchises: Provided, however, That the foregoing shall neither apply to nor affect provisions of telecommunications franchises concerning territory covered by the franchise, the life span of the franchise, or the type of service authorized by the franchise.\nOn January 7, 1999, Bayantel wrote the office of the City Assessor seeking the exclusion of its real properties in the city from the roll of taxable real properties. With its request having been denied, Bayantel interposed an appeal with the Local Board of Assessment Appeals (LBAA). And, evidently on its firm belief of its exempt status, Bayantel did not pay the real property taxes assessed against it by the Quezon City government.\n\nOn account thereof, the Quezon City Treasurer sent out notices of delinquency for the total amount of P43,878,208.18, followed by the issuance of several warrants of levy against Bayantel's properties preparatory to their sale at a public auction set on July 30, 2002.\n\nThreatened with the imminent loss of its properties, Bayantel immediately withdrew its appeal with the LBAA and instead filed with the RTC of Quezon City a petition for prohibition with an urgent application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction, thereat docketed as Civil Case No. Q-02-47292 , which was raffled to Branch 227 of the court.\n\nOn July 29, 2002, or in the eve of the public auction scheduled the following day, the lower court issued a TRO, followed, after due hearing, by a writ of preliminary injunction via its order of August 20, 2002.\n\nAnd, having heard the parties on the merits, the same court came out with its challenged Decision of June 6, 2003, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, pursuant to the enabling franchise under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7633, the real estate properties and buildings of petitioner [now, respondent Bayantel] which have been admitted to be used in the operation of petitioner's franchise described in the following tax declarations are hereby DECLARED exempt from real estate taxation:\n\n(1) Tax Declaration No. D-096-04071 \u2014\n(2) Tax Declaration No. D-096-04074 \u2014\n(3) Tax Declaration No. D-124-01013 \u2014\n(4) Tax Declaration No. D-011-10810 \u2014\n(5) Tax Declaration No. D-011-10811 \u2014\n(6) Tax Declaration No. D-011-10809 \u2014\n(7) Tax Declaration No. D-124-00941 \u2014\n(8) Tax Declaration No. D-124-00940 \u2014\n(9) Tax Declaration No. D-124-00939 \u2014\n(10) Tax Declaration No. D-096-04072 \u2014\n(11) Tax Declaration No. D-096-04073 \u2014\n(12) Tax Declaration No. D-011-11540 \u2014\nThe preliminary prohibitory injunction issued in the August 20, 2002 Order of this Court is hereby made permanent. Since this is a resolution of a purely legal issue, there is no pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nTheir motion for reconsideration having been denied by the court in its Order dated December 30, 2003, petitioners elevated the case directly to this Court on pure questions of law , ascribing to the lower court the following errors:\nI. [I]n declaring the real properties of respondent exempt from real property taxes notwithstanding the fact that the tax exemption granted to Bayantel in its original franchise had been withdrawn by the [LGC] and that the said exemption was not restored by the enactment of RA 7633.\n\nII. [In] declaring the real properties of respondent exempt from real property taxes notwithstanding the enactment of the [QCRC] which withdrew the tax exemption which may have been granted by RA 7633.\n\nIII. [In] declaring the real properties of respondent exempt from real property taxes notwithstanding the vague and ambiguous grant of tax exemption provided under Section 11 of RA 7633.\n\nIV. [In] declaring the real properties of respondent exempt from real property taxes notwithstanding the fact that [it] had failed to exhaust administrative remedies in its claim for real property tax exemption. (Words in bracket added.)\nAs we see it, the errors assigned may ultimately be reduced to two (2) basic issues, namely:\nWhether or not Bayantel's real properties in Quezon City are exempt from real property taxes under its legislative franchise; and\n\nWhether or not Bayantel is required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief with the trial court.\nWe shall first address the second issue, the same being procedural in nature.\n\nPetitioners argue that Bayantel had failed to avail itself of the administrative remedies provided for under the LGC, adding that the trial court erred in giving due course to Bayantel's petition for prohibition. To petitioners, the appeal mechanics under the LGC constitute Bayantel's plain and speedy remedy in this case.\n\nThe Court does not agree.\n\nPetitions for prohibition are governed by the following provision of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:\nSEC. 2. Petition for prohibition. \u2014 When the proceedings of any tribunal, \u2014 are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein, or otherwise, granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.\nWith the reality that Bayantel's real properties were already levied upon on account of its nonpayment of real estate taxes thereon, the Court agrees with Bayantel that an appeal to the LBAA is not a speedy and adequate remedy within the context of the aforequoted Section 2 of Rule 65. This is not to mention of the auction sale of said properties already scheduled on July 30, 2002.\n\nMoreover, one of the recognized exceptions to the exhaustion- of-administrative remedies rule is when, as here, only legal issues are to be resolved. In fact, the Court, cognizant of the nature of the questions presently involved, gave due course to the instant petition. As the Court has said in Ty vs. Trampe : [7]\nxxx. Although as a rule, administrative remedies must first be exhausted before resort to judicial action can prosper, there is a well-settled exception in cases where the controversy does not involve questions of fact but only of law. xxx.\nLest it be overlooked, an appeal to the LBAA, to be properly considered, required prior payment under protest of the amount of P43,878,208.18, a figure which, in the light of the then prevailing Asian financial crisis, may have been difficult to raise up. Given this reality, an appeal to the LBAA may not be considered as a plain, speedy and adequate remedy. It is thus understandable why Bayantel opted to withdraw its earlier appeal with the LBAA and, instead, filed its petition for prohibition with urgent application for injunctive relief in Civil Case No. Q-02-47292. The remedy availed of by Bayantel under Section 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court must be upheld.\n\nThis brings the Court to the more weighty question of whether or not Bayantel's real properties in Quezon City are, under its franchise, exempt from real property tax.\n\nThe lower court resolved the issue in the affirmative, basically owing to the phrase \"exclusive of this franchise\" found in Section 11 of Bayantel's amended franchise, Rep. Act No. 7633. To petitioners, however, the language of Section 11 of Rep. Act No. 7633 is neither clear nor unequivocal. The elaborate and extensive discussion devoted by the trial court on the meaning and import of said phrase, they add, suggests as much. It is petitioners' thesis that Bayantel was in no time given any express exemption from the payment of real property tax under its amendatory franchise.\n\nThere seems to be no issue as to Bayantel's exemption from real estate taxes by virtue of the term \"exclusive of the franchise\" qualifying the phrase \"same taxes on its real estate, buildings and personal property,\" found in Section 14, supra , of its franchise, Rep. Act No. 3259, as originally granted.\n\nThe legislative intent expressed in the phrase \"exclusive of this franchise\" cannot be construed other than distinguishing between two (2) sets of properties, be they real or personal, owned by the franchisee, namely, (a) those actually, directly and exclusively used in its radio or telecommunications business, and (b) those properties which are not so used. It is worthy to note that the properties subject of the present controversy are only those which are admittedly falling under the first category.\n\nTo the mind of the Court, Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 3259 effectively works to grant or delegate to local governments of Congress' inherent power to tax the franchisee's properties belonging to the second group of properties indicated above, that is, all properties which, \"exclusive of this franchise,\" are not actually and directly used in the pursuit of its franchise. As may be recalled, the taxing power of local governments under both the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions solely depended upon an enabling law . Absent such enabling law, local government units were without authority to impose and collect taxes on real properties within their respective territorial jurisdictions. While Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 3259 may be validly viewed as an implied delegation of power to tax, the delegation under that provision, as couched, is limited to impositions over properties of the franchisee which are not actually, directly and exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise. Necessarily, other properties of Bayantel directly used in the pursuit of its business are beyond the pale of the delegated taxing power of local governments. In a very real sense, therefore, real properties of Bayantel, save those exclusive of its franchise , are subject to realty taxes. Ultimately, therefore, the inevitable result was that all realties which are actually, directly and exclusively used in the operation of its franchise are \"exempted\" from any property tax.\n\nBayantel's franchise being national in character, the \"exemption\" thus granted under Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 3259 applies to all its real or personal properties found anywhere within the Philippine archipelago.\n\nHowever, with the LGC's taking effect on January 1, 1992, Bayantel's \"exemption\" from real estate taxes for properties of whatever kind located within the Metro Manila area was, by force of Section 234 of the Code, supra, expressly withdrawn. But, not long thereafter, however, or on July 20, 1992, Congress passed Rep. Act No. 7633 amending Bayantel's original franchise. Worthy of note is that Section 11 of Rep. Act No. 7633 is a virtual reenacment of the tax provision, i.e. , Section 14, supra , of Bayantel's original franchise under Rep. Act No. 3259. Stated otherwise, Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 3259 which was deemed impliedly repealed by Section 234 of the LGC was expressly revived under Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 7633. In concrete terms, the realty tax exemption heretofore enjoyed by Bayantel under its original franchise, but subsequently withdrawn by force of Section 234 of the LGC, has been restored by Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 7633.\n\nThe Court has taken stock of the fact that by virtue of Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, [8] local governments are empowered to levy taxes. And pursuant to this constitutional empowerment, juxtaposed with Section 232 [9] of the LGC, the Quezon City government enacted in 1993 its local Revenue Code, imposing real property tax on all real properties found within its territorial jurisdiction. And as earlier stated, the City's Revenue Code , just like the LGC, expressly withdrew, under Section 230 thereof, supra , all tax exemption privileges in general.\n\nThis thus raises the question of whether or not the City's Revenue Code pursuant to which the city treasurer of Quezon City levied real property taxes against Bayantel's real properties located within the City effectively withdrew the tax exemption enjoyed by Bayantel under its franchise, as amended.\n\nBayantel answers the poser in the negative arguing that once again it is only \" liable to pay the same taxes, as any other persons or corporations on all its real or personal properties, exclusive of its franchise .\"\n\nBayantel's posture is well-taken. While the system of local government taxation has changed with the onset of the 1987 Constitution, the power of local government units to tax is still limited. As we explained in Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority : [10]\nThe power to tax is primarily vested in the Congress; however, in our jurisdiction, it may be exercised by local legislative bodies, no longer merely be virtue of a valid delegation as before, but pursuant to direct authority conferred by Section 5, Article X of the Constitution. Under the latter, the exercise of the power may be subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide which, however, must be consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. (at p. 680; Emphasis supplied.)\nClearly then, while a new slant on the subject of local taxation now prevails in the sense that the former doctrine of local government units' delegated power to tax had been effectively modified with Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution now in place, .the basic doctrine on local taxation remains essentially the same. For as the Court stressed in Mactan , \"the power to tax is [still] primarily vested in the Congress.\"\n\nThis new perspective is best articulated by Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J., himself a Commissioner of the 1986 Constitutional Commission which crafted the 1987 Constitution, thus:\nWhat is the effect of Section 5 on the fiscal position of municipal corporations' Section 5 does not change the doctrine that municipal corporations do not possess inherent powers of taxation. What it does is to confer municipal corporations a general power to levy taxes and otherwise create sources of revenue. They no longer have to wait for a statutory grant of these powers. The power of the legislative authority relative to the fiscal powers of local governments has been reduced to the authority to impose limitations on municipal powers. Moreover, these limitations must be \"consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.\" The important legal effect of Section 5 is thus to reverse the principle that doubts are resolved against municipal corporations. Henceforth, in interpreting statutory provisions on municipal fiscal powers, doubts will be resolved in favor of municipal corporations. It is understood, however, that taxes imposed by local government must be for a public purpose, uniform within a locality, must not be confiscatory, and must be within the jurisdiction of the local unit to pass. [11] (Emphasis supplied).\nIn net effect, the controversy presently before the Court involves, at bottom, a clash between the inherent taxing power of the legislature, which necessarily includes the power to exempt, and the local government's delegated power to tax under the aegis of the 1987 Constitution.\n\nNow to go back to the Quezon City Revenue Code which imposed real estate taxes on all real properties within the city's territory and removed exemptions theretofore \"previously granted to, or presently enjoyed by all persons, whether natural or juridical ....,\" [12] there can really be no dispute that the power of the Quezon City Government to tax is limited by Section 232 of the LGC which expressly provides that \"a province or city or municipality within the Metropolitan Manila Area may levy an annual ad valorem tax on real property such as land, building, machinery, and other improvement not hereinafter specifically exempted. \" Under this law, the Legislature highlighted its power to thereafter exempt certain realties from the taxing power of local government units. An interpretation denying Congress such power to exempt would reduce the phrase \"not hereinafter specifically exempted\" as a pure jargon, without meaning whatsoever. Needless to state, such absurd situation is unacceptable.\n\nFor sure, in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. (PLDT) vs. City of Davao , [13] this Court has upheld the power of Congress to grant exemptions over the power of local government units to impose taxes. There, the Court wrote:\nIndeed, the grant of taxing powers to local government units under the Constitution and the LGC does not affect the power of Congress to grant exemptions to certain persons, pursuant to a declared national policy. The legal effect of the constitutional grant to local governments simply means that in interpreting statutory provisions on municipal taxing powers, doubts must be resolved in favor of municipal corporations. (Emphasis supplied.)\nAs we see it, then, the issue in this case no longer dwells on whether Congress has the power to exempt Bayantel's properties from realty taxes by its enactment of Rep. Act No. 7633 which amended Bayantel's original franchise. The more decisive question turns on whether Congress actually did exempt Bayantel's properties at all by virtue of Section 11 of Rep. Act No. 7633.\n\nAdmittedly, Rep. Act No. 7633 was enacted subsequent to the LGC. Perfectly aware that the LGC has already withdrawn Bayantel's former exemption from realty taxes, Congress opted to pass Rep. Act No. 7633 using, under Section 11 thereof, exactly the same defining phrase \"exclusive of this franchise\" which was the basis for Bayantel's exemption from realty taxes prior to the LGC. In plain language, Section 11 of Rep. Act No. 7633 states that \"the grantee, its successors or assigns shall be liable to pay the same taxes on their real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of this franchise, as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay.\" The Court views this subsequent piece of legislation as an express and real intention on the part of Congress to once again remove from the LGC's delegated taxing power , all of the franchisee's (Bayantel's) properties that are actually, directly and exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Chairperson, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, and Azcuna, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Penned by then Judge Vicente Q.

ROSE MARIE ALONZO LEGASTO AND ANTONIO SALVADOR, RESPONDENTS.DECISION\nINTERCONTINENTAL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (IBC-13), REP. BY ITS PRESIDENT RENATO BELLO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. ROSE MARIE ALONZO LEGASTO AND ANTONIO SALVADOR, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari assails the March 16, 2005 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 85085 which denied the petition filed by petitioner Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC-13) for lack of merit, and its July 22, 2005 Resolution [2] denying the motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe pertinent facts as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:\nFor the purpose of putting an end to the suit for a sum of money docketed as Civil Case No. Q-96-26330 before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, petitioner, as First Party, and private respondent Antonio Salvador, as Second Party, entered into a Compromise Agreement dated 22 May 1998 which contained the following stipulations, to wit:\n\"1. The FIRST PARTY shall pay the amount of TWO MILLION (P2,000,000.00) PESOS as shown by the statement hereto attached as Annex \"A\" which was verified and and (sic) reconciled with the books of the FIRST PARTY.\n\n2. Simultaneously with the signing hereof, the FIRST PARTY shall pay 25% of the aforesaid amount and the balance to be paid in staggered payments, payable in three (3) installments\n\n3. The FIRST PARTY agrees to offset the airtime 320-30's daytime spots against the FOUR MILLION (P4,000,000.00) PESOS marketing fee due to the FIRST PARTY under the separate Marketing Agreement between IBC and Colours Network, Inc., represented by ANTONIO SALVADOR at P12,500/spot. These airtime spots shall be utilized by the SECOND PARTY on ROS basis.\n\n4. The balance of 6,080-30's primetime spots airtime shall mean usage in commercial placement for TV commercials. In the event of privatization, the said spots will be valued at the company's prevailing market price and be made payable upon demand.\n\n5. Both parties shall submit a motion to dismiss the case pending before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.\nWith the submission of the foregoing Compromise Agreement alongside the parties' 8 June 1998 joint manifestation and motion to dismiss, Civil Case No. Q-96-26330 was dismissed on July 4, 1998.\n\nOn 18 December 2000, however, petitioner commenced an action to declare the aforesaid Compromise Agreement null and void ab initio. By then already privatized and under a new management, petitioner alleged, among other matters, that aside from its non-existent cause or object, said agreement was entered into by its erstwhile management without the requisite approval of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG); and, that private respondent should refund the P2,000,000.00 he received in virtue thereof and pay his overavailment of its 506.75 ROS spots amounting to P1,140,187.50. Incorporating claims for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, petitioner's complaint was docketed as Civil Case No.Q-00-42707 before public respondent's sala.\n\nContending that petitioner unjustifiably refused to comply with its obligation under paragraph 4 of the selfsame Compromise Agreement , on the other hand, private respondent filed the 5 January 2001 complaint for Specific Performance and Damages against petitioner, its President, Boots Anson Roa, and Legal Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Atty. Azucena Garcia. Docketed as Civil Case No. Q-01-43036 before Branch 220 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, private respondent's complaint sought the grant of the following reliefs:\n\"WHEREFORE, it is prayed that judgment be rendered directing defendant IBC to comply with paragraph 4 of the compromise agreement in accordance with the tenor thereof and to order all the defendants to jointly and severally pay the plaintiff the following:\nP200,000.00 as actual damages; P500,000.00 as moral damages; and P300,000.00 for and as attorney's fees.\nPlaintiff further prays for such other equitable reliefs as may be warranted in the premises.\"\nWith the two cases subsequently consolidated before public respondent, private respondent filed a motion for issuance of a writ of attachment on September 23, 2003. Maintaining that, computed on the average price of P90,000.00 per 30-second spot, his claim already totaled P540,000.000.00 private respondent alleged, among other matters, that petitioner was guilty of gross insincerity and bad faith in instituting Civil Case No. Q-00-42707; and, that with the sale of its DMZ-FM Station to Blockbuster Broadcasting System, petitioner manifested its determination to defeat his claim by leaving no sufficient security therefore (sic). On the theory that petitioner's answer to his complaint tendered no genuine issue as to any material fact, private respondent later filed a motion for summary judgment dated 28 February 2004.\n\nOn February 5, 2004, petitioner filed a motion styled as one for dismissal and/or suspension of all proceedings in the aforesaid consolidated cases. Calling public respondent's attention to the fact that private respondent only paid P8,517.50 in docket fees, petitioner maintained that, rather than for specific performance and damages as indicated in his complaint, private respondent's cause of action was actually one for a sum of money, the totality of the latter's claim, as disclosed in his motion for issuance of a writ of attachment, translated into unpaid docket fees amounting to P5,452,237.50; and, that private respondent's suit should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or, at the very least, suspended until payment of the correct docket fees. The motion was duly opposed by private respondent on 16 February 2004 . [3] (Emphasis added)\nOn March 26, 2004, the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 99, issued an Order [4] denying petitioner's motion to dismiss and/or suspension of all proceedings pending payment by respondent of the appropriate docket fees. The trial court held that petitioner is estopped from raising the issue of deficient docket fee in view of its active participation in the proceedings; that the deficiency in the filing fees did not divest it of its jurisdiction hence the proceedings need not be dismissed or suspended. The unpaid docket fees, however, would be treated as a judgment lien if favorable to respondent.\n\nAfter the denial of its motion for reconsideration, [5] petitioner filed on July 14, 2004 a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals. On September 29, 2004, it filed a manifestation apprising the appellate tribunal that on August 20, 2004, the trial court rendered judgment on respondent's motion for summary judgment, the decretal portion of which provides:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court resolves to:\nDENY the motion for the issuance of writ of attachment for having become moot and academic; RENDERS SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND ORDERS IBC-13 to pay ANTONIO SALVADOR the sum of:\nPhp540,000,000.00 representing the rounded monetized value of the 5,980 (out of 6,080) airtimes spots with 12% interest per annum thereon from the time of the filing of the complaint in January 2001 until fully paid;\nPhp100,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees.\nSO ORDERED. [6]\nIn its Decision dated March 16, 2005, the Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion in the denial of petitioner's motion to dismiss and/or suspend the proceedings. [7] It held that non-payment of the appropriate docket fees did not divest the trial court of its jurisdiction to try the case and that the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized deputy has the responsibility to make the deficiency assessment. [8]\n\nPetitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied [9] hence this petition.\n\nPetitioner contends that respondent failed to pay the correct docket fees thus the trial court never acquired the requisite jurisdiction over the case; that granting the lower court never lost its jurisdiction notwithstanding the deficiency assessment, it should have, in the interest of prudence and fair play, at least ordered the suspension of proceedings pending payment of the appropriate docket fees. [10]\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nContrary to petitioner's assertion, jurisdiction was properly acquired in this case. In the case of Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals , [11] we declared that:\nThe Court cannot close this case without making the observation that it frowns at the practice of counsel who filed the original complaint in this case of omitting any specification of the amount of damages in the prayer although the amount of over P78 million is alleged in the body of the complaint. This is clearly intended for no other purpose than to evade the payment of the correct filing fees if not to mislead the docket clerk in the assessment of the filing fee. This fraudulent practice was compounded when, even as this Court had taken cognizance of the anomaly and ordered an investigation, petitioner through another counsel filed an amended complaint, deleting all mention of the amount of damages being asked for in the body of the complaint. It was only when in obedience to the order of this Court of October 18, 1985, the trial court directed that the amount of damages be specified in the amended complaint, that petitioners' counsel wrote the damages sought in the much reduced amount of P10,000,000.00 in the body of the complaint but not in the prayer thereof. The design to avoid payment of the required docket fee is obvious.\n\nThe Court serves warning that it will take drastic action upon a repetition of this unethical practice.\n\nTo put a stop to this irregularity, henceforth all complaints, petitions, answers and other similar pleadings should specify the amount of damages being prayed for not only in the body of the pleading but also in the prayer, and said damages shall be considered in the assessment of the filing fees in any case. Any pleading that fails to comply with this requirement shall not be accepted nor admitted, or shall otherwise be expunged from the record.\n\nThe Court acquires jurisdiction over any case only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fee. An amendment of the complaint or similar pleading will not thereby vest jurisdiction in the Court, much less the payment of the docket fee based on the amounts sought in the amended pleading. The ruling in the Magaspi case, in so far as it is inconsistent with this pronouncement is overturned and reversed. [12]\nThe aforequoted pronouncement, however, has no application in the instant case. These stringent requirements have been relaxed in the subsequent case of Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion [13] which laid down the following rules:\nIt is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject matter or the nature of the action. Where the filing of the initiatory pleading is not accompanied by payment of docket fee, the court may allow payment of the fee within a reasonable time but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.\n\nThe same rule applies to permissive counterclaims, third-party claims and similar pleadings, which shall not be considered filed until and unless the filing fee prescribed therefor is paid. The court may also allow payment of said fee within a reasonable time but also in no case beyond its applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.\n\nWhere the trial court acquires jurisdiction over a claim by the filing of the appropriate pleading and payment of the prescribed filing fee but, subsequently, the judgment awards a claim not specified in the pleading, or if specified the same has been left for determination by the court, the additional filing fee therefor shall constitute a lien on the judgment. It shall be the responsibility of the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized deputy to enforce said lien and assess and collect the additional fee. (Emphasis added)\nSubsequently in Tacay v. Regional Trial Court of Tagum, Davao Del Norte, [14] the phrase \"awards of claims not specified in the pleading\" was clarified to refer only to damages arising after the filing of the complaint or similar pleading. [15] Be that as it may, we find that the court a quo properly acquired jurisdiction over the case.\n\nIn Proton Pilipinas Corporation v. Banque Nationale de Paris , [16] a case in which the docket fees paid by the plaintiff were also insufficient, we held that:\nWith respect to petitioner's argument that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case in light of the insufficient docket fees, the same does not lie.\n\nTrue, in Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, this Court held that the court acquires jurisdiction over any case only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fees, hence, it concluded that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.\n\nIt bears emphasis, however, that the ruling in Manchester was clarified in Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion when this Court held that in the former there was clearly an effort to defraud the government in avoiding to pay the correct docket fees, whereas in the latter the plaintiff demonstrated his willingness to abide by paying the additional fees as required.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe ruling in Sun Insurance Office was echoed in the 2005 case of Heirs of Bertuldo Hinog v. Hon. Achilles Melicor [17]\nPlainly, while the payment of the prescribed docket fees is a jurisdictional requirement, even its non-payment at the time of filing does not automatically cause the dismissal of the case, as long as the fees is paid within the applicable prescriptive or reglemantary period, more so when the party involved demonstrates a willingness to abide by the rules prescribing such payment. Thus, when insufficient filing fees were initially paid by the plaintiffs and there was no intention to defraud the government, the Manchester rule does not apply.\nA perusal of respondent's January 5, 2001 complaint shows that he prayed for the following reliefs:\nWHEREFORE, it is prayed that judgment be rendered directing defendant IBC to comply with paragraph 4 of the compromise agreement in accordance with the tenor thereof and to order all the defendants to jointly and severally pay the plaintiff the following:\nP200,000.00 as actual damages; P500,000.00 as moral damages; and P300,000.00 for and as attorney's fees.\nPlaintiff further prays for such other equitable reliefs as may be warranted in the premises. [18]\nOn the other hand, paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement which is the subject of the aforequoted prayer stipulates:\n4. The balance of 6,080-30's primetime spots airtime shall mean usage in commercial placement for TV commercials. In the event of privatization, the said spots will be valued at the company's prevailing market price and be made payable upon demand. [19]\nWhen the two aforementioned portions are taken together, it becomes apparent that at the time of the filing of the January 5, 2001 complaint by the respondent, paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement cannot yet be quantified in monetary terms. The value of the 6,080 - 30's primetime spots was dependent upon the privatization of the petitioner and its prevailing market price for the primetime spots. The only basis then for the computation of the docket fees are the damages that the respondent prays to be awarded to him. It was only when the trial court rendered its summary judgment of August 20, 2004 that respondent's prayer for specific performance was valued at P540,000,000.00. [20]\n\nWe also note that prior to the filing of the complaint for specific performance, respondent requested for a meeting with the members of petitioner's Board of Directors to discuss the monetary equivalent of paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement. Thus, in the letter dated October 26, 2000 [21] addressed to petitioner's President, respondent stated thus:\nWith the upcoming privatization of IBC-13 before the year ends as published in several newspapers, may I reiterate our request to have a meeting with the present Board of Directors of IBC-13, the Committee on Privatization and/or Management Committee, so we can finally discuss and settle the price of the current market of the primetime spot of IBC-13 as embodied on (sic) paragraph 4 of our Compromise Agreement dated May 22, 1998.\n\nFor your further reference, our company took the initiative of getting the official note card of all the TV stations and we hereby forward a copy of these such as;\n\nPrimetime Rate Card per 30's\nABS-CBN Channel 2 --------------------- P 131,250.00 PTV Channel 4 -----------------------------35,000.00 ABC Channel 5 -----------------------------75,000.00 GMA Channel 7 ----------------------------117,000.00 RPN Channel 9 ------------------------------92,000.00 IBC Channel 13 ----------------------------------?\nOn November 29, 2000, respondent again wrote the petitioner in this wise:\nThis is to inform you that our Compromise Agreement dated May 22, 1998 is final.\n\nSince your auditor claims that he doesn't have basis in the computation of the spots presented by the SGV, we agreed to submit a Comparative Statement of the 6,080 spots. The primary objective is to find the truth and veracity as supported by pertinent documents/papers that became the basis of our Compromise Agreement and further your basis in paying the additional 1.5 Million Pesos Cash in pursuant to paragraph I of the Compromise Agreement. We are ready next week to meet your internal auditor.\n\nAfter this meeting, may we discuss the cost per spot in pursuant to article 4 of our Compromise Agreement before Privatization as published in the Daily Inquirer (see attached). [22]\nThe foregoing indicate that respondent did not have a clear basis in computing the exact quantitative value of paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the P8,517.00 docket fees were computed on the basis of what was legally quantifiable at the time of the filing of the complaint. Upon proof of payment of the assessed fees by the respondent, the trial court properly acquired jurisdiction over the complaint. Jurisdiction once acquired is never lost, it continues until the case is terminated. [23]\n\nIn the case at bar, the respondent relied on the assessment made by the docket clerk which turned out to be incorrect. The payment of the docket fees, as assessed, negates any imputation of bad faith or an intent to defraud the government by the respondent. Thus, when insufficient filing fees were initially paid by the respondent and there was no intention to defraud the government, the Manchester rule does not apply. [24] Hence, the trial court properly acquired jurisdiction over the instant suit.\n\nFurther, Section 2 of Rule 141 of the Rules of Court clearly provides that:\nSec. 2. Fees in lien . - Where the court in its final judgment awards a claim not alleged, or a relief different from, or more than that claimed in the pleading, the party concerned shall pay the additional fees which shall constitute a lien on the judgment in satisfaction of said lien. The clerk of court shall assess and collect the corresponding fees.\nWhile we understand petitioner's apprehension that the failure to collect the appropriate docket fees carries detrimental repercussions to the efficient administration of justice, we cannot sustain its stand that in this case the judiciary will be defrauded of considerable docket fees. Based on the computations made by the petitioner, the appropriate docket fees is no less than P5,452,237.50. Such amount, if later found to be proper, constitutes a judgment lien on the P540 million awarded to the respondent by the trial court by way of summary judgment.\n\nThus, the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 99, or his duly authorized representative is hereby ordered to assess the amount of deficient docket fees due from the respondent, which will constitute a judgment lien on the amount awarded to him by summary judgment and to enforce the said judgment lien and to collect the additional fee.\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated March 16, 2005 and Resolution dated July 22, 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 85085 are AFFIRMED.\n\nThe Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 99, or his duly authorized deputy is hereby ordered to enforce the judgment lien and to assess and collect the additional fees from the respondent.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 43-54.

CONTRERAS, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, OCAMPO, CAMARINES SUR, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore us is a Verified Complaint [1] dated December 30, 2004 of Julio B. Verzosa (complainant) charging Judge Manuel E. Contreras (respondent), Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Ocampo, Camarines Sur with Grave Abuse of Authority, Grave Misconduct (Harassment and Oppression), and Violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, relative to Criminal Case No. 2071, entitled \"People of the Philippines v. Rodrigo E. Candelaria.\"\n\nComplainant alleges: he is a forest ranger of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Protected Area Office. On April 14, 2004, while conducting surveillance on treasure hunting activities in Mt. Isarog Natural Park, Ocampo, Camarines Sur, he and his co-forest rangers discovered an open pit left in damaged condition, allegedly in violation of Republic Act No. 7586. They likewise found and confiscated in favor of the Government two metal chains used to overturn huge stones in the treasure hunting site. He found out later that the alleged treasure hunters were led by a certain Jose Credo (Credo) a.k.a. \"Labaw\" and Basilio Sumalde (Sumalde) a.k.a . \"Moren\". The Executive Director of the DENR Region V Office thereafter ordered the complainant to continue monitoring the said treasure hunting site. Because of his involvement in the treasure hunting activities and on the basis of the testimony of Credo, he was implicated as an accessory in Criminal Case No. 2071 against Rodrigo Candelaria (Candelaria), et al. for robbery. The said case arose from the alleged information relayed by respondent to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Officers of Ocampo, Camarines Sur in the morning of April 18, 2004, which led to the arrest of the principal accused. Respondent did not inhibit himself from conducting the preliminary investigation despite his proven bias against all of the accused, in apparent violation of the guiding principles of Judicial Ethics and Responsibilities. Complainant was not among the persons on board the truck when the same was apprehended by members of the PNP on April 18, 2004. On the basis of the affidavit executed by Credo, respondent hastily issued an order for complainant's arrest. After the information reducing the charge from robbery to simple theft was filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 32, Pili, Camarines Sur, Judge Nilo Malanyaon, in an Order dated September 13, 2004 dismissed the case due to lack of probable cause. Respondent is the mastermind behind the treasure hunting activities in Ocampo, Camarines Sur and the robbery case for which complainant was implicated as an accessory was a way of harassing anybody who opposes the activities.\n\nIn his Comment, [2] respondent contends: on the latter part of March 2004, he went on mountain hiking at Mt. Isarog with the Tinablanan River as his destination. While at Mt. Isarog, he received an information that Candelaria, known confidant of the personnel of the DENR and by the CARE Philippines, was looting by dismantling the tower antennae of the Philippine Long Distance and Telephone Company (PLDT) used as a relay station but already inoperational. The PLDT Tower is already a government property and declared by the provincial government as a tourist attraction and destination being strategically located at the towering heights of Mt. Isarog. The activity of looting the steel trusses and bars of the PLDT Tower had been going on since January 2004. He directed the police of Ocampo, Camarines Sur to investigate the looting of the steel trusses and bars of the PLDT Tower. The second time that he went on mountain hiking at Tinablanan River on April 18, 2004, he was again informed that the steel trusses and bars of the PLDT Tower were already being loaded in a truck bound for the junkshop in Naga City. With the use of a binocular, he was able to personally confirm the report. He immediately called the PNP Regional Intelligence Group and in a checkpoint set up by the police, the truck was apprehended with Candelaria and several men aboard. On April 19, 2004, the OIC-Chief of Police of Ocampo, Camarines Sur filed a criminal complaint for robbery before the MTC of Ocampo, Camarines Sur docketed as Criminal Case No. 2071 for preliminary investigation. Upon conclusion of the preliminary investigation and finding probable cause against the accused for robbery, respondent forwarded the records to the Provincial Prosecutor of Camarines Sur for appropriate action. However, the provincial prosecutor modified the charge of robbery to theft, and the corresponding information was filed with the RTC, Branch 32, Pili, Camarines Sur, docketed as Criminal Case No. P-3647, presided by Judge Malanyaon. The latter, finding no probable cause, dismissed the case against complainant and likewise ordered the arresting officer to adduce additional evidence against the remaining accused for determination of judicial probable cause. Having failed to do so, Judge Malanyaon dismissed Criminal Case No. P-3647. Persons motivated with ill-will against him were just making a failed and porous connection to the alleged treasure hunting activity. If respondent was subsequently seen at Zone 2, Del Rosario, Ocampo, Camarines Sur after the apprehension of those involved in the looting at the PLDT Tower, it was because he was then conducting the preliminary investigation in Criminal Case No. 2071 having inquisitorial authority to extend his investigation on the area. The complainant's surmise that he is the mastermind of the alleged treasure hunting of the group of Sumalde was based on the alleged information relayed to complainant by Myrna Dacer, Daisy Moran, Salvacion Candelaria, Analiza Candelaria, and Mary Ann Candelaria. Complainant imputed bias against him when he did not inhibit from conducting the preliminary investigation in Criminal Case No. 2071 despite prior knowledge of the looting at the PLDT Tower. Prior knowledge of the commission of a crime is not a mandatory ground for a first level court judge to recuse himself from conducting preliminary investigation. It was just incidental that he caused the apprehension of the truck loaded with stolen trusses and bars of the PLDT Tower. Preliminary investigation is a quasi-judicial function of an MTC judge. The matter of issuance of a warrant of arrest is discretionary and judicial in nature which is authorized under the rules. If ever complainant perceived that irregularities attended the issuance of a warrant of arrest against him, he has all available judicial remedies, such as filing a motion to quash warrant of arrest, habeas corpus proceedings, or certiorari, but none was availed of by complainant despite being represented and assisted by a retained counsel. Under the Rules, the result/recommendation of the investigating judge during the preliminary investigation is subject to review or appropriate action by the provincial prosecutor. The finding of probable cause against the accused in Criminal Case No. 2071 was sustained by the provincial prosecutor of Camarines Sur upon review, although the recommended charge of robbery was modified to theft. The dismissal by Judge Malanyaon of the information for theft finding that no probable cause exists should not militate or be taken against him. He discharged his duties as investigating judge regularly with faithful adherence to the law and the rules, and he acted in good faith and without malice in his conduct of the preliminary investigation. The Sangguniang Bayan of Ocampo, Camarines Sur, rendered a committee report stating that an ocular inspection had been conducted on the alleged site of treasure hunting and they were able to confirm that it was indeed a fishpond loaded with so many growing fish and not a site of treasure hunting.\n\nIn the Agenda Report, [3] the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) submitted its evaluation and recommendation, to wit:\nEVALUATION:\n\nx x x x\n\nThe complainant, in branding the respondent Judge as the mastermind of the alleged treasure hunting activities in Ocampo, Camarines Sur, relied heavily on the narrations of and affidavits executed by Myrna Dacer, Daisy Moran, Salvacion Candelaria, Analiza and Mary Ann Candelaria. Clearly, these narrations/affidavits are not based on the complainant's own personal knowledge but rather on the personal knowledge of the said persons. The same are, thus, considered hearsay because their probative force depends, in whole or in part, on the competency and credibility of some persons other tha[n] the complainant. (Estrada vs. Desierto, G.R. Nos. 146710-15, April 3, 2001). For being hearsay, the same are insufficient and inconclusive to determine the participation of the respondent Judge in the alleged treasure hunting activities in Ocampo, Camarines Sur. In this light, the complainant failed to submit substantial evidence to support his imputation that the respondent Judge is the mastermind behind the treasure hunting activities in Ocampo, Camarines Sur.\n\nWith respect to the issuance of warrant of arrest, such issue is judicial and may be best resolved through judicial adjudication. As correctly pointed out by the respondent Judge, if there are irregularities in the issuance of warrant against the complainant, the latter has all available judicial remedies, such as filing a motion to quash, an action for habeas corpus, or a special civil action for certiorari. However, the complainant chose not to avail of any judicial remedy.\n\nTo merit disciplinary sanction, the error or mistake committed by a judge should be patent, gross, malicious, deliberate, or done in bad faith and absent a clear showing that the judge has acted errantly; the issue becomes judicial in character and would not properly warrant the imposition of administrative punishment (Godinez vs. Alano, 303 SCRA 259).\n\nAt any rate, the respondent Judge followed the letter of the law, specifically Rule 112, Section 6, paragraph b, when, prior to the issuance of warrant of arrest against the complainant, he personally conducted preliminary examination in the form of searching questions and answers on witness Jose Credo and upon finding probable cause and the necessity to place the complainant under custody in order [not] to frustrate the ends of justice.\n\nAnent the respondent Judge's failure to inhibit himself in conducting the preliminary investigation in Criminal Case No. 2071, he violated Rule 3.12 of the Code of Judicial Conduct (now Canon 3, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct) for taking part in a proceeding where he has personal knowledge of the disputed evidentiary facts. Respondent Judge admitted having prior knowledge of the looting and dismantling of the PLDT Tower in Ocampo, Camarines Sur. As a matter of fact, he was able to visually confirm the said activities which he later relayed to the local PNP and led to the arrest of the principal accused in the said case. [The] Judge still conducted the preliminary investigation.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that while no motion for inhibition of respondent judge was filed by the complainant during the preliminary investigation stage of the case, this does not mean that respondent can freely act on the same despite the lingering doubt created in the minds of the parties that he would not be impartial in his judgment.\n\nA judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than those mentioned above. While the first paragraph of Article 137 provides for the specific grounds for disqualification and gives the judicial officer no discretion to sit in a case, the second paragraph leaves the matter of inhibition to the sound discretion of the judge (People vs. Serrano, 203 SCRA 17).\n\nIt does not explicitly enumerate the specific grounds for inhibition but provides a broad policy-oriented ground for disqualification of judges for just and valid reasons other than those enumerated in the first paragraph (Geotina vs. Gonzales, 41 SCRA 66).\n\nThe judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case for just and valid reasons (Parayno vs. Meneses, 231 SCRA 807) other than those mentioned in Rule 137, Section 1. The ultimate test in determining the validity of the court's inhibition is whether or not the petitioner is deprived of fair and impartial trial (Associacion de Agricultures de Talisay-Silay, Inc. vs. Talisay-Silay Milling Co., Inc., 88 SCRA 294) and the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.\n\nRECOMMENDATION : Respectfully submitted for the consideration of the Honorable Court are our recommendations that:\nThe instant matter be re-docketed as a regular administrative case;\n\nJudge Manuel E. Contreras, Municipal Trial Court of Ocampo, Camarines Sur be admonished for violation of Canon 3, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct with a warning that repetition of the same or similar offense in the future shall be dealt with more severely. On September 5, 2006 and September 26, 2006, complainant and respondent manifested their willingness to submit the case for decision/ resolution based on the pleadings filed, respectively.\n\nWe agree with the findings of the OCA except that respondent should be reprimanded instead of being merely admonished.\n\nPreliminary investigation is an inquiry or proceeding to determine whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial. [4]\n\nThe issue of whether a judge should voluntarily inhibit himself is addressed to his sound discretion pursuant to paragraph 2 of Section 1, Rule 137, Rules of Court, which provides that a judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for a just or valid reason other than those mentioned in the first paragraph. [5]\n\nHowever, respondent failed to consider the proscription under Rule 3.12(a) of Canon 3, Code of Judicial Conduct, to wit:\nRule 3.12. - A judge should take no part in a proceeding where the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. These cases include, among others, proceedings where:\n\n(a) the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.\nIn Oktubre v. Velasco , [6] citing Perez v. Suller , [7] we held that the rule on disqualification of judges under Rule 3.12 and Section 1, Rule 137 -\n[S]tems from the principle that no judge should preside in a case in which he is not wholly free, disinterested, impartial and independent. A Judge should not handle a case in which he might be perceived to be susceptible to bias and partiality. The rule is intended to preserve the people's faith and confidence in the courts of justice. [8]\nTrue, a judge should possess proficiency in law so that he can competently construe and enforce the law. However, it is more important that he should act and behave in such a manner that the parties before him have confidence in his impartiality. Indeed, even conduct that gives rise to the mere appearance of partiality is proscribed. [9]\n\nRecords reveal that respondent had prior knowledge of the looting and dismantling at the PLDT Tower in Ocampo, Camarines Sur and he was instrumental in the apprehension of the robbers. Respondent should have been aware of the impropriety of conducting the preliminary investigation considering that Rule 3.12(a), Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct enjoins a judge from taking part in proceedings where the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Respondent ignored said rule, warranting disciplinary sanction from this Court.\n\nRespondent's averment that prior knowledge of the commission of a crime is not a mandatory ground for the first level court judge to recuse himself from conducting preliminary investigation, holds no water. As a judge, respondent must keep himself abreast with the law. He should have known that it is well entrenched in the Code of Judicial Conduct, prevailing at that time, that personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding disqualifies him from taking part in such proceeding as the same would necessarily spawn a perception that he is bias and impartial. It is of no moment that the finding of probable cause was sustained by the provincial prosecutor. What is of paramount importance is the perceived bias and impartiality by the complainant against respondent in his conduct of the preliminary investigation due to respondent's prior knowledge of the looting at the PLDT Tower, respondent being instrumental in the apprehension of the robbers.\n\nAlthough respondent should have inhibited himself from conducting the preliminary investigation, it did not render as void the act of respondent in issuing a warrant of arrest. He acted within the bounds of the then existing Section 6(b), Rule 112 [10] of the Rules of Court which provides, inter alia , that without waiting for the conclusion of the investigation, the judge may issue a warrant of arrest if he finds after an examination in writing and under oath of the complainant and his witnesses in the form of searching questions and answers, that a probable cause exists and that there is a necessity of placing the respondent under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice.\n\nThe OCA rightly observed that respondent followed the letter of the existing Rule, when, prior to the issuance of warrant of arrest against complainant, respondent personally conducted preliminary examination in the form of searching questions and answers on witness Credo. The purpose of issuing the warrant of arrest was to place the respondents under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. [11] Whether it is necessary to place the accused in custody is left to the judge's sound judgment. [12]\n\nMoreover, the OCA correctly sustained respondent's claim that if ever complainant perceived that irregularities attended the issuance of warrant of arrest against him, he has all available judicial remedies, [13] such as filing a motion to quash warrant of arrest, habeas corpus proceedings, or certiorari , but none was availed of by complainant.\n\nIn Lumbos v. Baliguat, [14] we held that as a matter of policy, the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. He cannot be subjected to liability - civil, criminal, or administrative - for any of his official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as he acts in good faith. [15] To hold, otherwise, would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. [16] An inquiry into the administrative liability of a judge may be resorted to only after the available remedies have been exhausted and decided with finality. [17] For until there is a final declaration by the appellate court that the challenged order or judgment is manifestly erroneous, there will be no basis to conclude whether respondent is administratively liable. [18] The Court has to be shown acts or conduct of the judge clearly indicative of arbitrariness or prejudice before the latter can be branded the stigma of being biased and partial. [19] Thus, not every error or mistake that a judge commits in the performance of his duties renders him liable, unless he is shown to have acted in bad faith or with deliberate intent to do an injustice. [20] Good faith and absence of malice, corrupt motives or improper considerations are sufficient defenses in which a judge x x x can find refuge. [21]\n\nAnent the allegation that respondent is the mastermind behind the treasure hunting activities in Ocampo, Camarines Sur, we find the allegation to be devoid of merit.\n\nIn Espa\u00f1ol v. Mupas , [22] we held that in administrative proceedings, complainants have the burden of proving by substantial evidence the allegations in their complaints. Thus, when the complainant relies mainly on second-hand information to prove the charges against the respondent, the complaint is reduced into a bare indictment or mere speculation. [23] The Court cannot give credence to charges based on mere suspicion or speculation. In this case, complainant failed to discharge that burden. As aptly observed by the OCA, complainant has no personal knowledge of the treasure hunting by respondent as he relied only on the information relayed to him by the relatives of the accused Candelaria in the robbery case.\n\nFurthermore, we find that the affidavits of Myrna Dacer, Daisy Moran, Salvacion Candelaria, Analiza Candelaria, and Mary Ann Candelaria relate to the incident surrounding the arrest of Dante Dacer, one of the accused in the robbery case. The police blotter which is not even a certified true copy is an alleged threat made by respondent against Mary Ann Candelaria. Nowhere in the said documents do we find that respondent was being tagged as the mastermind of the treasure hunting. Taken all together, these documents have no prima facie evidentiary value as to warrant further investigation on the matter.\n\nIn Mataga v. Rosete , [24] we held that any administrative complaint leveled against a judge must always be examined with a discriminating eye, for its consequential effects are by their nature highly penal, such that the respondent judge stands to face the sanction of dismissal or disbarment. Mere imputation of judicial misconduct in the absence of sufficient proof to sustain the same will never be countenanced. [25] If a judge should be disciplined for misconduct, the evidence against him should be competent. [26]\n\nIn fine, we find that respondent is merely guilty of violating the Code of Judicial Conduct in not recusing himself from conducting preliminary investigation.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court finds Judge Manuel E. Contreras, MTC, Ocampo, Camarines Sur guilty of violation of Rule 3.12(a), Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct and is REPRIMANDED with warning that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nSantiago, (Chairperson), and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\nCallejo, Sr., J., on leave.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 1-8.\n\n[2] Id. at 48-66.\n\n[3] Id. at 429-433.\n\n[4] Sec. 1, Rule 112, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.\n\n[5] Section 1.

NO. 169393, April 07, 2006 ]\n\nTONY L. BENWAREN, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND EDWIN CRISOLOGO, RESPONDENTS.DECISION\nTONY L. BENWAREN, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND EDWIN CRISOLOGO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nAZCUNA, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for certiorari alleging that the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) en banc gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the Resolution of August 3, 2005, which denied the motion to reconsider the COMELEC's First Division Resolution dated February 18, 2005.\n\nThe COMELEC's First Divison Resolution dated February 18, 2005 dismissed petitioner's Petition to Annul Proclamation or to Suspend the Effects Thereof and Petition to Declare Illegal [the] Proceedings of the New Board of Canvassers of Tineg, Abra.\n\nThe antecedents are as follows:\n\nPetitioner Tony L. Benwaren and private respondent Edwin Crisologo were candidates for the position of Municipal Mayor of the Municipality of Tineg, Abra in the May 2004 elections. After the elections, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) of Tineg, Abra canvassed 14 out of 16 election returns from the 16 precincts that functioned on the day of the elections. The election returns from Precincts Nos. 8A and 16A were contested and became the subject of pre-proclamation controversies before the COMELEC.\n\nDuring the canvass of the election return of Precinct No. 16A on May 15, 2004, counsel for petitioner objected to the inclusion of the election return on the ground that the same was allegedly prepared under duress, force or intimidation, or was prepared by persons other than the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI) concerned. He added that the other copies of the election return were likewise tampered with, altered, falsified, inauthentic or prepared under duress, threat, intimidation or coercion or by unauthorized persons.\n\nOn May 16, 2004, the MBC issued a Ruling excluding the election return of Precinct No. 16A of Tineg, Abra insofar as the mayoralty candidates were concerned on the following grounds:\nx x x It is very apparent on the face of the election return that irregularities were attendant in its preparation and its submission to the Board. No names of BEI appeared in the ER, [the ER is] not signed and thumbmark[ed] and the copy for the ER inten[d]ed for national positions is missing. Likewise the BEIs cannot be located.\nThe MBC deferred the proclamation of the winning candidate for the position of Municipal Mayor because it contended that the contested election return from Precinct No. 16A would affect the result of the election for the position.\n\nOn May 19, 2004, Benwaren filed a petition [1] before the COMELEC, docketed as COMELEC Case No. SPC 04-091, praying for the issuance of an order granting authority to re-open the ballot box from Precinct No. 16A and to recount its ballots.\n\nOn June 28, 2004, the COMELEC's First Division dismissed the petition. However, on July 21, 2004, it issued a Supplemental Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nThus, to finally and speedily settle and put an end to the controversy at hand following the procedure laid down in Section 235 of the Omnibus Election Code, this Commission (First Division) hereby ORDERS the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Tineg, Abra to:\nReconvene, upon prior notice to the parties, candidates, and persons concerned;\n\nRetrieve the other authentic copies of subject election returns and if necessary, the copy inside the ballot box and canvass the same;\n\nRetrieve, after giving notice to the candidates concerned, the ballot box containing the ballots in the subject precinct from the Municipal Treasurer should the other copies of the return [appear] likewise to be tampered with, altered or falsified, or otherwise not authentic, or [to have been] prepared by the board of election inspectors under duress, force, intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the member[s] of the board of election inspectors;\n\nDetermine if the identity and integrity of the said ballot box and the ballots contained therein were not violated; and, proceed to recount the votes of the candidates affected and prepare a new election return for the said precinct; and then\n\nCanvass the said return and proclaim the winning candidate/s; or\n\nProclaim the winning candidate/s based on the remaining uncontested returns, [if] the integrity of the ballot box and the ballots contained therein have not been preserved and are no longer intact.\nFor the above purpose, a new board of Canvassers is hereby constituted to be composed of Atty. Armando Velasco as chairman, and Atty. Jubil Surmieda and Atty. Ma. Norina Tangaro-Casingal, as Vice Chairman and Secretary, respectively, the same to convene at the Comelec Main Office, Manila.\n\nSO ORDERED. [2]\nThe New MBC issued notices to the concerned parties that it will convene on August 3, 2004 to canvass the contested election return from the ballot box of Precinct No. 16A, Barangay Lanec, Tineg, Abra.\n\nOn August 3, 2004, the New MBC convened and the counsels for both parties were present. Petitioner alleged that before the integrity of the ballot box of Precinct No. 16A and its contents was determined, his counsel moved that the officially canvassed returns must first be tabulated, including the election return from Precinct No. 8A, to determine the actual results. However, the New MBC denied the motion and ruled that Precinct No. 8A cannot be included in the canvass because of the pending pre-proclamation case entitled In the Matter of the Petition to Exclude Election Returns of Precinct No. 8A, Municipality of Tineg, Abra, Edwin Crisologo, petitioner (SPC 2004-216), and the results therein were recorded in a Temporary Statement of Votes.\n\nAfter opening the ballot box of Precinct No. 16A, the New MBC issued a Ruling, thus:\nPursuant to the Resolution of the First Division in SPC No. 04-091 in re \"IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION FOR AUTHORITY TO RE-OPEN BALLOT BOX AND RECOUNT BALLOTS FROM PRECINCT NO. 16-A OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF TINEG, ABRA, \" the Board proceeded with the determination of the identity and integrity of the ballot box from precinct 16-A and the ballots contained therein x x x and found as follows:\nThe Board found the integrity of the ballot box to have been violated considering the fact and as borne out by the Minutes of the previous Board, [that] the ballot box of Precinct 16-A was left at the lobby of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Building unattended, it was not delivered to the Municipal Trea[s]urer of Tineg, Abra, who is the proper custodian of the same as provided under the Omnibus Election Code;\n\nThe Board likewise found that the integrity of the ballots [was] no longer intact considering the fact that the said ballots were not placed in its proper envelope and neither was it sealed with the paper seal provided for by the Commission.\nConsidering the foregoing including the manifestations and counter manifestations of both parties, the Board rules as follows:\nthe board is left with no recourse but to proceed with the implementation of paragraph six (6) of the above stated Resolution, \" To proclaim the winning candidate/s based on the remaining uncontested returns, [if] the integrity of the ballot box and the ballots contained therein have not been preserved and are no longer intact. \";\n\nthe Motion of counsel for complainant Benwaren to have a physical count of the votes for petitioner and respondent as part of the inventory is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. [3] The New MBC proclaimed private respondent Crisologo as the duly elected mayor of Tineg, Abra based on the results of the remaining uncontested election returns.\n\nOn August 9, 2004, petitioner filed a Petition to Annul Proclamation or to Suspend the Effects Thereof and Petition to Declare Illegal [the] Proceedings of the New Board of Canvassers of Tineg, Abra, docketed as SPC No. 04-297.\n\nIn a Resolution dated February 18, 2005, the COMELEC First Division dismissed the petition for lack of merit, declaring the New MBC was specifically mandated by it to determine whether the identity and integrity of the ballot box for Precinct No. 16A and its ballots were violated. Thus, it held that the matter was left to the sound discretion of the members of the New MBC, which complied with its order. It added that the New MBC is presumed to have regularly performed its official duty absent a strong proof to the contrary by petitioner.\n\nThe COMELEC First Division also ruled that the proclamation of respondent Crisologo, even without the election return from Precinct No. 8A having been canvassed, was proper under Section 20 (i) of Republic Act No. 7166, thus:\nThe Board of Canvassers shall not proclaim any candidate as winner unless authorized by the Commission after the latter has ruled on the object brought to it on appeal by the losing party. Any proclamation made in violation hereof shall be void ab initio , unless the contested returns will not adversely affect the results of the election.\nThe COMELEC First Division stated that if the votes of Benwaren and Crisologo in Precinct No. 8A are added to their votes in the uncontested precincts, Crisologo still emerges as the winner.\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied for lack of merit by the COMELEC en banc in a Resolution dated August 31, 2005.\n\nPetitioner thus filed this petition, raising the following issues:\nThe COMELEC gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it affirmed the ruling of the New MBC that the integrity of the ballot box for Precinct No. 16A, Barangay Lanec, Tineg, Abra, and its contents had been violated.\n\nThe COMELEC gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it illegally proclaimed private respondent Crisologo based on incomplete canvass of votes.\n\nThe COMELEC en banc Resolution dated August 31, 2005 was illegally promulgated since former Commissioners Virgilio O. Garcillano and Manuel A. Barcelona, Jr. were no longer members of the COMELEC at the time of promulgation. [4] Petitioner contends that the COMELEC en banc gravely abused its discretion in sustaining the First Division's Resolution that affirmed the Ruling of the New MBC that the integrity of the ballot box of Precinct No. 16A and its contents had been violated despite insufficient evidence to justify the ruling. He argues that the finding of the New MBC that the integrity of the ballot box for Precinct No. 16A and its contents was violated because the ballot box was \"left at the lobby of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan unattended,\" and that the \"ballots were not placed in its proper envelope and neither was it sealed with the paper seal provided for by the Commission\" is insufficient as basis for concluding against the integrity of the ballot box and ballots from Precinct No. 16A. Hence, he asserts that the results of Precinct No. 16A should not have been excluded.\n\nThe contention is without merit.\n\nIn its Supplemental Resolution dated July 21, 2004, the COMELEC First Division specifically mandated the New MBC to determine whether the identity and integrity of the ballot box of Precinct No. 16A and its ballots were violated. After convening for that purpose, the New MBC found that the integrity of the ballot box of Precinct No. 16A and its contents was violated and it issued a Ruling accordingly. The COMELEC upheld the factual finding of the New MBC and declared that the New MBC is presumed to have regularly performed its official duty absent any proof to the contrary by petitioner. The factual findings of administrative agencies which have acquired expertise in their field are generally binding and conclusive on the courts in the absence of grave abuse and none has been shown in this case.\n\nNext, petitioner contends that private respondent Crisologo's proclamation is void, because it was based on an incomplete canvass of votes. He claims that the New MBC hastily made the proclamation despite the pending petition for exclusion of the election return of Precinct No. 8A; hence, the votes contained in the election return of Precinct No. 8A and the votes in Precinct No. 16A, which would materially affect the result of the election, were not counted.\n\nRespondent Crisologo, on the other hand, claims that the ruling of the MBC on the election return of Precinct No. 8A is pending appeal before the COMELEC, so that it may be deduced that the MBC denied his petition to exclude from the canvass the election return of Precinct No. 8A.\n\nThe COMELEC ruled that based on Section 20 (i) of Republic Act No. 7166, [5] earlier cited, the proclamation of private respondent Crisologo was proper because the contested returns would not adversely affect the results of the election, thus: Petitioner Benwaren himself admitted that excluding the votes cast in the two contested precincts, he (Benwaren) had 807 votes, while Crisologo had 914 votes. If the votes in Precinct No. 8A as reflected on the contested return are added to their votes in the uncontested precincts, the result would be 918 as against 924, in favor of private respondent Crisologo who still emerges the winner by a margin of six (6) votes.\n\nIt bears noting that it was private respondent Crisologo, and not petitioner, who contested the election return of Precinct No. 8A, so petitioner cannot claim to get more than what is reflected in the election return of that precinct. The propriety of including or excluding the said return, therefore, is thereby rendered moot and academic. Consequently, the proclamation of respondent Crisologo has to be sustained.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the COMELEC en banc did not gravely abuse its discretion in upholding the proclamation of private respondent.\n\nLastly, petitioner contends that the COMELEC en banc Resolution promulgated on August 31, 2005 is null and void, because Commissioners Virgilio O. Garcillano and Manuel A. Barcelona, Jr., who participated in the Resolution, were no longer members of the COMELEC en banc at the time of its promulgation. Petitioner asserts that it is public knowledge that as of June 9, 2005, Garcillano and Barcelona were no longer connected with the COMELEC since their ad interim appointments were bypassed by the Commission on Appointments and they were not re-appointed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nIn his Comment, private respondent Crisologo admits that the questioned COMELEC en banc Resolution bore the signatures of former Commissioners Garcillano and Barcelona, who were no longer COMELEC Commissioners during the promulgation of the Resolution. Nevertheless, he contends that their participation will not affect the validity of the Resolution because four other Commissioners and the Chairman concurred with the ponencia . He adds that it was a unanimous decision by the sitting and actual members of the COMELEC, since no other commissioners were appointed at that time.\n\nThe Court agrees with private respondent. A decision becomes binding only after it is validly promulgated. [6] Consequently, if at the time of the promulgation of a decision or resolution, a member of the collegiate court who had earlier signed or registered his vote has vacated his office, his vote is automatically withdrawn or cancelled. [7] The Resolution, in this case, remains valid because it is still supported by a majority of the COMELEC en banc.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED . The Resolution of the Commission on Elections en banc dated August 3, 2005, denying reconsideration of the Resolution of the Commission on Elections First Division dated February 18, 2005, is AFFIRMED.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Garcia, and Velasco, Jr., JJ ., concur.\nPuno, J. ,on leave\n\n* On leave\n\n[1] Entitle d IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION FOR AUTHORITY TO RE-OPEN BALLOT BOX AND RECOUNT BALLOTS FROM PRECINCT NO. 16-A OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF TINEG, ABRA, TONY L.

National Labor Relations Commission [2] that the closure of ITC's Butuan Plant was valid should not have been applied in the instant cases which pertain to ITC's Stanply Plant.\u00a0 They further claim that the findings by the Labor Arbiter that there was a shortage of raw materials; that the wood processing plaint permit has expired; that the lease contract with IPGC was terminated; and that ITC and IPGC were not business conduits, were all debunked\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 by the NLRC.\n\nThe arguments raised have been amply discussed; at any rate, they are inconsequential as to affect the assailed Decision.\n\nOn the other hand, petitioners in G.R. No. 164518 who are also respondents in G.R. No. 164965 also filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration seeking to delete or reduce the nominal damages awarded to each employee, considering that since August 17, 1990 it had ceased operation of its business and that the award involves a huge amount considering that there are 97 workers. [3]\n\nWhile we ruled in this case that the sanction should be stiffer in a dismissal based on authorized cause where the employer failed to comply with the notice requirement than a dismissal based on just cause with the same procedural infirmity, however, in instances where the execution of a decision becomes impossible, unjust, or too burdensome, modification of the decision becomes necessary in order to harmonize the disposition with the prevailing circumstances.\n\nIn the determination of the amount of nominal damages which is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, several factors are taken into account: (1) the authorized cause invoked, whether it was a retrenchment or a closure or cessation of operation of the establishment due to serious business losses or financial reverses or otherwise; (2) the number of employees to be awarded; (3) the capacity of the employers to satisfy the awards, taken into account their prevailing financial status as borne by the records; (4) the employer's grant of other termination benefits in favor of the employees; and (5) whether there was a bona fide attempt to comply with the notice requirements as opposed to giving no notice at all.\n\nIn the case at bar, there was valid authorized cause considering the closure or cessation of ITC's business which was done in good faith and due to circumstances beyond ITC's control.\u00a0 Moreover, ITC had ceased to generate any income since its closure on August 17, 1990.\u00a0 Several months prior to the closure, ITC experienced diminished income due to high production costs, erratic supply of raw materials, depressed prices, and poor market conditions for its wood products.\u00a0 It appears that ITC had given its employees all benefits in accord with the CBA upon their termination.\n\nThus, considering the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar, we deem it wise and just to reduce the amount of nominal damages to be awarded for each employee to P10,000.00 each instead of P50,000.00 each.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration of respondents in G.R. No. 164518 who are also petitioners in G.R. No. 164965 is DENIED. The Motion for Partial Reconsideration of petitioners in G.R. No. 164518 who are also respondents in G.R. No. 164965 is GRANTED .\u00a0 The amount of nominal damages awarded to each employee is reduced from P50,000.00 to P10,000.00.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo (G.R No. 164518), p. 279.\n\n[2] 339 Phil. 395 (1997).\n\n[3] Id. at 281-283.\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

      "title": "They argue that B.P. No. 880 requires a permit before one can stage a public assembly regardless of the presence or absence of a clear and present danger. It also curtails the choice of venue and is thus repugnant to the freedom of expression clause as the time and place of a public assembly form part of the message for which the expression is sought. Furthermore, it is not content-neutral as it does not apply to mass actions in support of the government. The words \"lawful cause,\" \"opinion,\" \"protesting or influencing\" suggest the exposition of some cause not espoused by the government. Also, the phrase \"maximum tolerance\" shows that the law applies to assemblies against the government because they are being tolerated. As a content-based legislation, it cannot pass the strict scrutiny test.Petitioners Jess del Prado, et al., in turn, argue that B.P. No. 880 is unconstitutional as it is a curtailment of the right to peacefully assemble and petition for redress of grievances because it puts a condition for the valid exercise of that right. It also characterizes public assemblies without a permit as illegal and penalizes them and allows their dispersal. Thus, its provisions are not mere regulations but are actually prohibitions.Furthermore, the law delegates powers to the Mayor without providing clear standards. The two standards stated in the laws (clear and present danger and imminent and grave danger) are inconsistent.Regarding the CPR policy, it is void for being an ultra vires act that alters the standard of maximum tolerance set forth in B.P. No. 880, aside from being void for being vague and for lack of publication.Finally, petitioners KMU, et al., argue that the Constitution sets no limits on the right to assembly and therefore B.P. No. 880 cannot put the prior requirement of securing a permit. And even assuming that the legislature can set limits to this right, the limits provided are unreasonable: First, allowing the Mayor to deny the permit on clear and convincing evidence of a clear and present danger is too comprehensive. Second, the five-day requirement to apply for a permit is too long as certain events require instant public assembly, otherwise interest on the issue would possibly wane.As to the CPR policy, they argue that it is preemptive, that the government takes action even before the rallyists can perform their act, and that no law, ordinance or executive order supports the policy. Furthermore, it contravenes the maximum tolerance policy of B.P. No. 880 and violates the Constitution as it causes a chilling effect on the exercise by the people of the right to peaceably assemble.Respondents in G.R. No. 169838 are Eduardo Ermita, as Executive Secretary, Manila City Mayor Lito Atienza, Chief, of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Gen. Arturo Lomibao, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Chief, PNP Maj. Gen. Vidal Querol, and Manila Police District (MPD) Chief Gen. Pedro Bulaong.Respondents in G.R. No. 169848 are Eduardo Ermita as Executive Secretary and in his personal capacity; Angelo Reyes, as Secretary of the Interior and Local Governments; Arturo Lomibao, as Chief Vidal Querol, as Chief, NCRPO; Pedro Bulaong, as Chief, MPD, and all other public officers and private individuals acting under their control, supervision and instruction.Respondents in G.R. No. 169881 are the Honorable Executive Secretary, PNP Director General Arturo Lomibao, the Honorable Mayor Joselito Atienza, and PNP MPD Chief Pedro Bulaong.Respondents argue that:Petitioners have no standing because they have not presented evidence that they had been \"injured, arrested or detained because of the CPR,\" and that \"those arrested stand to be charged with violating Batas Pambansa [No.] 880 and other offenses.\"Neither B.P. No. 880 nor CPR is void on its face. Petitioners cannot honestly claim that the time, place and manner regulation embodied in B.P. No. 880 violates the three-pronged test for such a measure, to wit: (a) B.P. No. 880 is content-neutral, i.e., it has no reference to content of regulated speech; (b) B.P. No. 880 is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, i.e., the interest cannot be equally well served by a means that is less intrusive of free speech interests; and (c) B.P. No. 880 leaves open alternative channels for communication of the information.[6]B.P. No. 880 is content-neutral as seen from the text of the law. Section 5 requires the statement of the public assembly's time, place and manner of conduct. It entails traffic re-routing to prevent grave public inconvenience and serious or undue interference in the free flow of commerce and trade. Furthermore, nothing in B.P. No. 880 authorizes the denial of a permit on the basis of a rally's program content or the statements of the speakers therein, except under the constitutional precept of the \"clear and present danger test.\" The status of B.P. No. 880 as a content-neutral regulation has been recognized in Osme\u00f1a v. Comelec.[7]Adiong v. Comelec[8] held that B.P. No. 880 is a content-neutral regulation of the time, place and manner of holding public assemblies and the law passes the test for such regulation, namely, these regulations need only a substantial governmental interest to support them.Sangalang v. Intermediate Appellate Court[9] held that a local chief executive has the authority to exercise police power to meet \"the demands of the common good in terms of traffic decongestion and public convenience.\" Furthermore, the discretion given to the mayor is narrowly circumscribed by Sections 5 (d), and 6 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), 13 and 15 of the law.The standards set forth in the law are not inconsistent. \"Clear and convincing evidence that the public assembly will create a clear and present danger to public order, public safety, public convenience, public morals or public health\" and \"imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil\" both express the meaning of the \"clear and present danger test.\"[10]CPR is simply the responsible and judicious use of means allowed by existing laws and ordinances to protect public interest and restore public order. Thus, it is not accurate to call it a new rule but rather it is a more pro-active and dynamic enforcement of existing laws, regulations and ordinances to prevent chaos in the streets. It does not replace the rule of maximum tolerance in B.P. No. 880.Respondent Mayor Joselito Atienza, for his part, submitted in his Comment that the petition in G.R. No. 169838 should be dismissed on the ground that Republic Act No. 7160 gives the Mayor power to deny a permit independently of B.P. No. 880; that his denials of permits were under the \"clear and present danger' rule as there was a clamor to stop rallies that disrupt the economy and to protect the lives of other people; that J. B. L. Reyes v. Bagatsing,[11] Primicias v. Fugoso,[12] and Jacinto v. CA,[13] have affirmed the constitutionality of requiring a permit; that the permit is for the use of a public place and not for the exercise of rights; and that B.P. No. 880 is not a content-based regulation because it covers all rallies.The petitions were ordered consolidated on February 14, 2006. After the submission of all the Comments, the Court set the cases for oral arguments on April 4, 2006,[14] stating the principal issues, as follows:On the constitutionality of Batas Pambansa No. 880, specifically Sections 4, 5, 6, 12 13(a) and 14(a) thereof, and Republic Act No. 7160:(a) Are these content-neutral or content-based regulations?(b) Are they void on grounds of overbreadth or vagueness?(c) Do they constitute prior restraint?(d) Are they undue delegations of powers to Mayors?(e) Do they violate international human rights treaties and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?On the constitutionality and legality of the policy of Calibrated Preemptive Response (CPR):(a) Is the policy void on its face or due to vagueness?(b) Is it void for lack of publication?(c) Is the policy of CPR void as applied to the rallies of September 26 and October 4, 5 and 6, 2005?During the course of the oral arguments, the following developments took place and were approved and/or noted by the Court:Petitioners, in the interest of a speedy resolution of the petitions, withdrew the portions of their petitions raising factual issues, particularly those raising the issue of whether B.P. No. 880 and/or CPR is void as applied to the rallies of September 20, October 4, 5 and 6, 2005.The Solicitor General agreed with the observation of the Chief Justice that CPR should no longer be used as a legal term inasmuch as, according to respondents, it was merely a \"catchword\" intended to clarify what was thought to be a misunderstanding of the maximum tolerance policy set forth in B.P. No. 880 and that, as stated in the affidavit executed by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita and submitted to the Ombudsman, it does not replace B.P. No. 880 and the maximum tolerance policy embodied in that law.The Court will now proceed to address the principal issues, taking into account the foregoing developments.Petitioners' standing cannot be seriously challenged. Their right as citizens to engage in peaceful assembly and exercise the right of petition, as guaranteed by the Constitution, is directly affected by B.P. No. 880 which requires a permit for all who would publicly assemble in the nation's streets and parks. They have, in fact, purposely engaged in public assemblies without the required permits to press their claim that no such permit can be validly required without violating the Constitutional guarantee. Respondents, on the other hand, have challenged such action as contrary to law and dispersed the public assemblies held without the permit.Section 4 of Article III of the Constitution provides:Sec. 4. No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.The first point to mark is that the right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances is, together with freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press, a right that enjoys primacy in the realm of constitutional protection. For these rights constitute the very basis of a functional democratic polity, without which all the other rights would be meaningless and unprotected. As stated in Jacinto v. CA,[15] the Court, as early as the onset of this century, in U.S. v. Apurado,[16] already upheld the right to assembly and petition, as follows:There is no question as to the petitioners' rights to peaceful assembly to petition the government for a redress of grievances and, for that matter, to organize or form associations for purposes not contrary to law, as well as to engage in peaceful concerted activities. These rights are guaranteed by no less than the Constitution, particularly Sections 4 and 8 of the Bill of Rights, Section 2(5) of Article IX, and Section 3 of Article XIII. Jurisprudence abounds with hallowed pronouncements defending and promoting the people's exercise of these rights. As early as the onset of this century, this Court in U.S. vs. Apurado, already upheld the right to assembly and petition and even went as far as to acknowledge:\"It is rather to be expected that more or less disorder will mark the public assembly of the people to protest against grievances whether real or imaginary, because on such occasions feeling is always wrought to a high pitch of excitement, and the greater, the grievance and the more intense the feeling, the less perfect, as a rule will be the disciplinary control of the leaders over their irresponsible followers. But if the prosecution be permitted to seize upon every instance of such disorderly conduct by individual members of a crowd as an excuse to characterize the assembly as a seditious and tumultuous rising against the authorities, then the right to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances would expose all those who took part therein to the severest and most unmerited punishment, if the purposes which they sought to attain did not happen to be pleasing to the prosecuting authorities. If instances of disorderly conduct occur on such occasions, the guilty individuals should be sought out and punished therefor, but the utmost discretion must be exercised in drawing the line between disorderly and seditious conduct and between an essentially peaceable assembly and a tumultuous uprising.\"Again, in Primicias v. Fugoso,[17] the Court likewise sustained the primacy of freedom of speech and to assembly and petition over comfort and convenience in the use of streets and parks.Next, however, it must be remembered that the right, while sacrosanct, is not absolute. In Primicias, this Court said:The right to freedom of speech, and to peacefully assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances, are fundamental personal rights of the people recognized and guaranteed by the constitutions of democratic countries. But it is a settled principle growing out of the nature of well-ordered civil societies that the exercise of those rights is not absolute for it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having equal rights, nor injurious to the rights of the community or society. The power to regulate the exercise of such and other constitutional rights is termed the sovereign \"police power,\" which is the power to prescribe regulations, to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety, and general welfare of the people. This sovereign police power is exercised by the government through its legislative branch by the enactment of laws regulating those and other constitutional and civil rights, and it may be delegated to political subdivisions, such as towns, municipalities and cities by authorizing their legislative bodies called municipal and city councils enact ordinances for purpose.[18]Reyes v. Bagatsing[19] further expounded on the right and its limits, as follows:It is thus clear that the Court is called upon to protect the exercise of the cognate rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, arising from the denial of a permit. The Constitution is quite explicit: \"No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for redress of grievances.\" Free speech, like free press, may be identified with the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully any matter of public concern without censorship or punishment. There is to be then no previous restraint on the communication of views or subsequent liability whether in libel suits, prosecution for sedition, or action for damages, or contempt proceedings unless there be a \"clear and present danger of a substantive evil that [the State] has a right to prevent.\" Freedom of assembly connotes the right of the people to meet peaceably for consultation and discussion of matters of public concern. It is entitled to be accorded the utmost deference and respect. It is not to be limited, much less denied, except on a showing, as is the case with freedom of expression, of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil that the state has a right to prevent. Even prior to the 1935 Constitution, Justice Malcolm had occasion to stress that it is a necessary consequence of our republican institutions and complements the right of free speech. To paraphrase the opinion of Justice Rutledge, speaking for the majority of the American Supreme Court in Thomas v. Collins, it was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom of speech and of the press were coupled in a single guarantee with the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances. All these rights, while not identical, are inseparable. In every case, therefore, where there is a limitation placed on the exercise of this right, the judiciary is called upon to examine the effects of the challenged governmental actuation. The sole justification for a limitation on the exercise of this right, so fundamental to the maintenance of democratic institutions, is the danger, of a character both grave and imminent, of a serious evil to public safety, public morals, public health, or any other legitimate public interest.Nowhere is the rationale that underlies the freedom of expression and peaceable assembly better expressed than in this excerpt from an opinion of Justice Frankfurter: \"It must never be forgotten, however, that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment. Back of the guaranty of free speech lay faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the peaceful means for gaining access to the mind. It was in order to avert force and explosions due to restrictions upon rational modes of communication that the guaranty of free speech was given a generous scope. But utterance in a context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution.\" What was rightfully stressed is the abandonment of reason, the utterance, whether verbal or printed, being in a context of violence. It must always be remembered that this right likewise provides for a safety valve, allowing parties the opportunity to give vent to their views, even if contrary to the prevailing climate of opinion. For if the peaceful means of communication cannot be availed of, resort to non-peaceful means may be the only alternative. Nor is this the sole reason for the expression of dissent. It means more than just the right to be heard of the person who feels aggrieved or who is dissatisfied with things as they are. Its value may lie in the fact that there may be something worth hearing from the dissenter. That is to ensure a true ferment of ideas. There are, of course, well-defined limits. What is guaranteed is peaceable assembly. One may not advocate disorder in the name of protest, much less preach rebellion under the cloak of dissent. The Constitution frowns on disorder or tumult attending a rally or assembly. Resort to force is ruled out and outbreaks of violence to be avoided. The utmost calm though is not required. As pointed out in an early Philippine case, penned in 1907 to be precise, United States v. Apurado: \"It is rather to be expected that more or less disorder will mark the public assembly of the people to protest against grievances whether real or imaginary, because on such occasions feeling is always wrought to a high pitch of excitement, and the greater the grievance and the more intense the feeling, the less perfect, as a rule, will be the disciplinary control of the leaders over their irresponsible followers.\" It bears repeating that for the constitutional right to be invoked, riotous conduct, injury to property, and acts of vandalism must be avoided. To give free rein to one's destructive urges is to call for condemnation. It is to make a mockery of the high estate occupied by intellectual liberty in our scheme of values.There can be no legal objection, absent the existence of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil, on the choice of Luneta as the place where the peace rally would start. The Philippines is committed to the view expressed in the plurality opinion, of 1939 vintage of, Justice Roberts in Hague v. CIO: \"Whenever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights and liberties of citizens. The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but must not, in the guise of respondents, be abridged or denied.\" The above excerpt was quoted with approval in Primicias v. Fugoso. Primicias made explicit what was implicit in Municipality of Cavite v. Rojas, a 1915 decision, where this Court categorically affirmed that plazas or parks and streets are outside the commerce of man and thus nullified a contract that leased Plaza Soledad of plaintiff-municipality. Reference was made to such plaza \"being a promenade for public use,\" which certainly is not the only purpose that it could serve. To repeat, there can be no valid reason why a permit should not be granted for the proposed march and rally starting from a public park that is the Luneta.Neither can there be any valid objection to the use of the streets to the gates of the US embassy, hardly two blocks away at the Roxas Boulevard. Primicias v. Fugoso has resolved any lurking doubt on the matter. In holding that the then Mayor Fugoso of the City of Manila should grant a permit for a public meeting at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, this Court categorically declared: \"Our conclusion finds support in the decision in the case of Willis Cox v. State of New Hampshire, 312 U.S., 569. In that case, the statute of New Hampshire P.L. chap. 145, section 2, providing that no parade or procession upon any ground abutting thereon, shall be permitted unless a special license therefor shall first be obtained from the selectmen of the town or from licensing committee,\" was construed by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire as not conferring upon the licensing board unfettered discretion to refuse to grant the license, and held valid. And the Supreme Court of the United States, in its decision (1941) penned by Chief Justice Hughes affirming the judgment of the State Supreme Court, held that \"a statute requiring persons using the public streets for a parade or procession to procure a special license therefor from the local authorities is not an unconstitutional abridgment of the rights of assembly or of freedom of speech and press, where, as the statute is construed by the state courts, the licensing authorities are strictly limited, in the issuance of licenses, to a consideration of the time, place, and manner of the parade or procession, with a view to conserving the public convenience and of affording an opportunity to provide proper policing, and are not invested with arbitrary discretion to issue or refuse license, * * *. \"Nor should the point made by Chief Justice Hughes in a subsequent portion of the opinion be ignored: \"Civil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the existence of an organized society maintaining public order without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestricted abuses. The authority of a municipality to impose regulations in order to assure the safety and convenience of the people in the use of public highways has never been regarded as inconsistent with civil liberties but rather as one of the means of safeguarding the good order upon which they ultimately depend. The control of travel on the streets of cities is the most familiar illustration of this recognition of social need. Where a restriction of the use of highways in that relation is designed to promote the public convenience in the interest of all, it cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which in other circumstances would be entitled to protection.\"x x xx x x The principle under American doctrines was given utterance by Chief Justice Hughes in these words: \"The question, if the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly are to be preserved, is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects.\" There could be danger to public peace and safety if such a gathering were marked by turbulence. That would deprive it of its peaceful character. It is true that the licensing official, here respondent Mayor, is not devoid of discretion in determining whether or not a permit would be granted. It is not, however, unfettered discretion. While prudence requires that there be a realistic appraisal not of what may possibly occur but of what may probably occur, given all the relevant circumstances, still the assumption - especially so where the assembly is scheduled for a specific public place - is that the permit must be for the assembly being held there. The exercise of such a right, in the language of Justice Roberts, speaking for the American Supreme Court, is not to be \"abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\"x x xBy way of a summary. The applicants for a permit to hold an assembly should inform the licensing authority of the date, the public place where and the time when it will take place. If it were a private place, only the consent of the owner or the one entitled to its legal possession is required. Such application should be filed well ahead in time to enable the public official concerned to appraise whether there may be valid objections to the grant of the permit or to its grant but at another public place. It is an indispensable condition to such refusal or modification that the clear and present danger test be the standard for the decision reached. If he is of the view that there is such an imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil, the applicants must be heard on the matter. Thereafter, his decision, whether favorable or adverse, must be transmitted to them at the earliest opportunity. Thus if so minded, they can have recourse to the proper judicial authority. Free speech and peaceable assembly, along with the other intellectual freedoms, are highly ranked in our scheme of constitutional values. It cannot be too strongly stressed that on the judiciary, -- even more so than on the other departments - rests the grave and delicate responsibility of assuring respect for and deference to such preferred rights. No verbal formula, no sanctifying phrase can, of course, dispense with what has been so felicitiously termed by Justice Holmes \"as the sovereign prerogative of judgment.\" Nonetheless, the presumption must be to incline the weight of the scales of justice on the side of such rights, enjoying as they do precedence and primacy. x x x.B.P. No. 880 was enacted after this Court rendered its decision in Reyes.The provisions of B.P. No. 880 practically codify the ruling in Reyes:Reyes v. Bagatsing (G.R. No. L-65366, November 9, 1983,125 SCRA 553, 569)8. By way of a summary. The applicants for a permit to hold an assembly should inform the licensing authority of the date, the public place where and the time when it will take place. If it were a private place, only the consent of the owner or the one entitled to its legal possession is required. Such application should be filed well ahead in time to enable the public official concerned to appraise whether there may be valid objections to the grant of the permit or to its grant but at another public place. It is an indispensable condition to such refusal or modification that the clear and present danger test be the standard for the decision reached. If he is of the view that there is such an imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil, the applicants must be heard on the matter. Thereafter, his decision, whether favorable or adverse, must be transmitted to them at the earliest opportunity. Thus if so minded, they can have recourse to the proper judicial authority.B.P. No. 880Sec. 4. Permit when required and when not required.-- A written permit shall be required for any person or persons to organize and hold a public assembly in a public place. However, no permit shall be required if the public assembly shall be done or made in a freedom park duly established by law or ordinance or in private property, in which case only the consent of the owner or the one entitled to its legal possession is required, or in the campus of a government-owned and operated educational institution which shall be subject to the rules and regulations of said educational institution. Political meetings or rallies held during any election campaign period as provided for by law are not covered by this Act.Sec.5. Application requirements.-- All applications for a permit shall comply with the following guidelines:(a) The applications shall be in writing and shall include the names of the leaders or organizers; the purpose of such public assembly; the date, time and duration thereof, and place or streets to be used for the intended activity; and the probable number of persons participating, the transport and the public address systems to be used.(b) The application shall incorporate the duty and responsibility of applicant under Section 8 hereof.(c) The application shall be filed with the office of the mayor of the city or municipality in whose jurisdiction the intended activity is to be held, at least five (5) working days before the scheduled public assembly.(d) Upon receipt of the application, which must be duly acknowledged in writing, the office of the city or municipal mayor shall cause the same to immediately be posted at a conspicuous place in the city or municipal building.Sec. 6. Action to be taken on the application. -(a) It shall be the duty of the mayor or any official acting in his behalf to issue or grant a permit unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the public assembly will create a clear and present danger to public order, public safety, public convenience, public morals or public health.(b) The mayor or any official acting in his behalf shall act on the application within two (2) working days from the date the application was filed, failing which, the permit shall be deemed granted. Should for any reason the mayor or any official acting in his behalf refuse to accept the application for a permit, said application shall be posted by the applicant on the premises of the office of the mayor and shall be deemed to have been filed.(c) If the mayor is of the view that there is imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil warranting the denial or modification of the permit, he shall immediately inform the applicant who must be heard on the matter.(d) The action on the permit shall be in writing and served on the applica[nt] within twenty-four hours.(e) If the mayor or any official acting in his behalf denies the application or modifies the terms thereof in his permit, the applicant may contest the decision in an appropriate court of law.(f) In case suit is brought before the Metropolitan Trial Court, the Municipal Trial Court, the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, the Regional Trial Court, or the Intermediate Appellate Court, its decisions may be appealed to the appropriate court within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of the same. No appeal bond and record on appeal shall be required. A decision granting such permit or modifying it in terms satisfactory to the applicant shall be immediately executory.(g) All cases filed in court under this section shall be decided within twenty-four (24) hours from date of filing. Cases filed hereunder shall be immediately endorsed to the executive judge for disposition or, in his absence, to the next in rank.(h) In all cases, any decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court.(i) Telegraphic appeals to be followed by formal appeals are hereby allowed.It is very clear, therefore, that B.P. No. 880 is not an absolute ban of public assemblies but a restriction that simply regulates the time, place and manner of the assemblies. This was adverted to in Osme\u00f1a v. Comelec,[20] where the Court referred to it as a \"content-neutral\" regulation of the time, place, and manner of holding public assemblies.[21]A fair and impartial reading of B.P. No. 880 thus readily shows that it refers to all kinds of public assemblies[22] that would use public places. The reference to \"lawful cause\" does not make it content-based because assemblies really have to be for lawful causes, otherwise they would not be \"peaceable\" and entitled to protection. Neither are the words \"opinion,\" \"protesting\" and \"influencing\" in the definition of public assembly content based, since they can refer to any subject. The words \"petitioning the government for redress of grievances\" come from the wording of the Constitution, so its use cannot be avoided. Finally, maximum tolerance is for the protection and benefit of all rallyists and is independent of the content of the expressions in the rally.Furthermore, the permit can only be denied on the ground of clear and present danger to public order, public safety, public convenience, public morals or public health. This is a recognized exception to the exercise of the right even under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, thus:Universal Declaration of Human RightsArticle 20Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.x x xArticle 29Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.The International Covenant on Civil and Political RightsArticle 19.Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.Contrary to petitioner's claim, the law is very clear and is nowhere vague in its provisions. \"Public\" does not have to be defined. Its ordinary meaning is well-known. Webster's Dictionary defines it, thus:[23]public, n, x x x 2a: an organized body of people x x x 3: a group of people distinguished by common interests or characteristics x x x.Not every expression of opinion is a public assembly. The law refers to \"rally, demonstration, march, parade, procession or any other form of mass or concerted action held in a public place.\" So it does not cover any and all kinds of gatherings.Neither is the law overbroad. It regulates the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly and petition only to the extent needed to avoid a clear and present danger of the substantive evils Congress has the right to prevent.There is, likewise, no prior restraint, since the content of the speech is not relevant to the regulation.As to the delegation of powers to the mayor, the law provides a precise and sufficient standard -the clear and present danger test stated in Sec. 6(a). The reference to \"imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil\" in Sec. 6(c) substantially means the same thing and is not an inconsistent standard. As to whether respondent Mayor has the same power independently under Republic Act No. 7160[24] is thus not necessary to resolve in these proceedings, and was not pursued by the parties in their arguments.Finally, for those who cannot wait, Section 15 of the law provides for an alternative forum through the creation of freedom parks where no prior permit is needed for peaceful assembly and petition at any time:Sec. 15. Freedom parks. - Every city and municipality in the country shall within six months after the effectivity of this Act establish or designate at least one suitable \"freedom park\" or mall in their respective jurisdictions which, as far as practicable, shall be centrally located within the poblacion where demonstrations and meetings may be held at any time without the need of any prior permit.In the cities and municipalities of Metropolitan Manila, the respective mayors shall establish the freedom parks within the period of six months from the effectivity this Act.This brings up the point, however, of compliance with this provision.The Solicitor General stated during the oral arguments that, to his knowledge, only Cebu City has declared a freedom park \" Fuente Osme\u00f1a.That of Manila, the Sunken Gardens, has since been converted into a golf course, he added.If this is so, the degree of observance of B.P. No. 880's mandate that every city and municipality set aside a freedom park within six months from its effectivity in 1985, or 20 years ago, would be pathetic and regrettable. The matter appears to have been taken for granted amidst the swell of freedom that rose from the peaceful revolution of 1986.Considering that the existence of such freedom parks is an essential part of the law's system of regulation of the people's exercise of their right to peacefully assemble and petition, the Court is constrained to rule that after thirty (30) days from the finality of this Decision, no prior permit may be required for the exercise of such right in any public park or plaza of a city or municipality until that city or municipality shall have complied with Section 15 of the law. For without such alternative forum, to deny the permit would in effect be to deny the right. Advance notices should, however, be given to the authorities to ensure proper coordination and orderly proceedings.The Court now comes to the matter of the CPR. As stated earlier, the Solicitor General has conceded that the use of the term should now be discontinued, since it does not mean anything other than the maximum tolerance policy set forth in B.P. No. 880. This is stated in the Affidavit of respondent Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita, submitted by the Solicitor General, thus:The truth of the matter is the policy of \"calibrated preemptive response\" is in consonance with the legal definition of \"maximum tolerance\" under Section 3 (c) of B.P. Blg. 880, which is the \"highest degree of restraint that the military, police and other peacekeeping authorities shall observe during a public assembly or in the dispersal of the same.\" Unfortunately, however, the phrase \"maximum tolerance\" has acquired a different meaning over the years. Many have taken it to mean inaction on the part of law enforcers even in the face of mayhem and serious threats to public order. More so, other felt that they need not bother secure a permit when holding rallies thinking this would be \"tolerated.\" Clearly, the popular connotation of \"maximum tolerance\" has departed from its real essence under B.P. Blg. 880.It should be emphasized that the policy of maximum tolerance is provided under the same law which requires all pubic assemblies to have a permit, which allows the dispersal of rallies without a permit, and which recognizes certain instances when water cannons may be used. This could only mean that \"maximum tolerance\" is not in conflict with a \"no permit, no rally policy\" or with the dispersal and use of water cannons under certain circumstances for indeed, the maximum amount of tolerance required is dependent on how peaceful or unruly a mass action is. Our law enforcers should calibrate their response based on the circumstances on the ground with the view to preempting the outbreak of violence.Thus, when I stated that calibrated preemptive response is being enforced in lieu of maximum tolerance I clearly was not referring to its legal definition but to the distorted and much abused definition that it has now acquired. I only wanted to disabuse the minds of the public from the notion that law enforcers would shirk their responsibility of keeping the peace even when confronted with dangerously threatening behavior. I wanted to send a message that we would no longer be lax in enforcing the law but would henceforth follow it to the letter. Thus I said, \"we have instructed the PNP as well as the local government units to strictly enforce a no permit, no rally policy . . . arrest all persons violating the laws of the land . . . unlawful mass actions will be dispersed.\" None of these is at loggerheads with the letter and spirit of Batas Pambansa Blg. 880. It is thus absurd for complainants to even claim that I ordered my co-respondents to violate any law.[25]At any rate, the Court rules that in view of the maximum tolerance mandated by B.P. No. 880, CPR serves no valid purpose if it means the same thing as maximum tolerance and is illegal if it means something else. Accordingly, what is to be followed is and should be that mandated by the law itself, namely, maximum tolerance, which specifically means the following:Sec. 3. Definition of terms. - For purposes of this Act:x x x(c) \"Maximum tolerance\" means the highest degree of restraint that the military, police and other peace keeping authorities shall observe during a public assembly or in the dispersal of the same.x x xSec. 9. Non-interference by law enforcement authorities. - Law enforcement agencies shall not interfere with the holding of a public assembly. However, to adequately ensure public safety, a law enforcement contingent under the command of a responsible police officer may be detailed and stationed in a place at least one hundred (100) meters away from the area of activity ready to maintain peace and order at all times.Sec. 10. Police assistance when requested. - It shall be imperative for law enforcement agencies, when their assistance is requested by the leaders or organizers, to perform their duties always mindful that their responsibility to provide proper protection to those exercising their right peaceably to assemble and the freedom of expression is primordial. Towards this end, law enforcement agencies shall observe the following guidelines:(a) Members of the law enforcement contingent who deal with the demonstrators shall be in complete uniform with their nameplates and units to which they belong displayed prominently on the front and dorsal parts of their uniform and must observe the policy of \"maximum tolerance\" as herein defined;(b) The members of the law enforcement contingent shall not carry any kind of firearms but may be equipped with baton or riot sticks, shields, crash helmets with visor, gas masks, boots or ankle high shoes with shin guards;(c) Tear gas, smoke grenades, water cannons, or any similar anti-riot device shall not be used unless the public assembly is attended by actual violence or serious threats of violence, or deliberate destruction of property.Sec. 11. Dispersal of public assembly with permit. - No public assembly with a permit shall be dispersed. However, when an assembly becomes violent, the police may disperse such public assembly as follows:(a) At the first sign of impending violence, the ranking officer of the law enforcement contingent shall call the attention of the leaders of the public assembly and ask the latter to prevent any possible disturbance;(b) If actual violence starts to a point where rocks or other harmful objects from the participants are thrown at the police or at the non-participants, or at any property causing damage to such property, the ranking officer of the law enforcement contingent shall audibly warn the participants that if the disturbance persists, the public assembly will be dispersed;(c) If the violence or disturbance prevailing as stated in the preceding subparagraph should not stop or abate, the ranking officer of the law enforcement contingent shall audibly issue a warning to the participants of the public assembly, and after allowing a reasonable period of time to lapse, shall immediately order it to forthwith disperse;(d) No arrest of any leader, organizer or participant shall also be made during the public assembly unless he violates during the assembly a law, statute, ordinance or any provision of this Act. Such arrest shall be governed by Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended;(d) Isolated acts or incidents of disorder or breach of the peace during the public assembly may be peacefully dispersed.x x xSec. 12. Dispersal of public assembly without permit. - When the public assembly is held without a permit where a permit is required, the said public assembly may be peacefully dispersed.Sec. 13. Prohibited acts. - The following shall constitute violations of the Act:(e) Obstructing, impeding, disrupting or otherwise denying the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly;(f) The unnecessary firing of firearms by a member of any law enforcement agency or any person to disperse the public assembly;(g) Acts described hereunder if committed within one hundred (100) meters from the area of activity of the public assembly or on the occasion thereof:x x xthe carrying of firearms by members of the law enforcement unit;the interfering with or intentionally disturbing the holding of a public assembly by the use of a motor vehicle, its horns and loud sound systems.Furthermore, there is need to address the situation adverted to by petitioners where mayors do not act on applications for a permit and when the police demand a permit and the rallyists could not produce one, the rally is immediately dispersed. In such a situation, as a necessary consequence and part of maximum tolerance, rallyists who can show the police an application duly filed on a given date can, after two days from said date, rally in accordance with their application without the need to show a permit, the grant of the permit being then presumed under the law, and it will be the burden of the authorities to show that there has been a denial of the application, in which case the rally may be peacefully dispersed following the procedure of maximum tolerance prescribed by the law.In sum, this Court reiterates its basic policy of upholding the fundamental rights of our people, especially freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In several policy addresses, Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban has repeatedly vowed to uphold the liberty of our people and to nurture their prosperity. He said that \"in cases involving liberty, the scales of justice should weigh heavily against the government and in favor of the poor, the oppressed, the marginalized, the dispossessed and the weak. Indeed, laws and actions that restrict fundamental rights come to the courts with a heavy presumption against their validity. These laws and actions are subjected to heightened scrutiny.\"[26]For this reason, the so-called calibrated preemptive response policy has no place in our legal firmament and must be struck down as a darkness that shrouds freedom. It merely confuses our people and is used by some police agents to justify abuses. On the other hand, B.P. No. 880 cannot be condemned as unconstitutional; it does not curtail or unduly restrict freedoms; it merely regulates the use of public places as to the time, place and manner of assemblies. Far from being insidious, \"maximum tolerance\" is for the benefit of rallyists, not the government. The delegation to the mayors of the power to issue rally \"permits\" is valid because it is subject to the constitutionally-sound \"clear and present danger\" standard.In this Decision, the Court goes even one step further in safeguarding liberty by giving local governments a deadline of 30 days within which to designate specific freedom parks as provided under B.P. No. 880. If, after that period, no such parks are so identified in accordance with Section 15 of the law, all public parks and plazas of the municipality or city concerned shall in effect be deemed freedom parks; no prior permit of whatever kind shall be required to hold an assembly therein. The only requirement will be written notices to the police and the mayor's office to allow proper coordination and orderly activities.WHEREFORE, the petitions are GRANTED in part, and respondents, more particularly the Secretary of the Interior and Local Governments, are DIRECTED to take all necessary steps for the immediate compliance with Section 15 of Batas Pambansa No. 880 through the establishment or designation of at least one suitable freedom park or plaza in every city and municipality of the country. After thirty (30) days from the finality of this Decision, subject to the giving of advance notices, no prior permit shall be required to exercise the right to peaceably assemble and petition in the public parks or plazas of a city or municipality that has not yet complied with Section 15 of the law. Furthermore, Calibrated Preemptive Response (CPR), insofar as it would purport to differ from or be in lieu of maximum tolerance, is NULL and VOID and respondents are ENJOINED to REFRAIN from using it and to STRICTLY OBSERVE the requirements of maximum tolerance. The petitions are DISMISSED in all other respects, and the constitutionality of Batas Pambansa No. 880 is SUSTAINED.No costs.SO ORDERED.Panganiban, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Garcia, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.Puno, J., on leave.Chico-Nazario, J., on official leave.[1] Petition for Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order filed by Bayan, Karapatan, Kilusang Magbubukid Ng Pilipinas (KMP), COURAGE, GABRIELA, Fr.

PEDRO BULAONG, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nAZCUNA, J.:\n\nPetitioners come in three groups.\n\nThe first petitioners, Bayan, et al. , in G.R. No. 169838, [1] allege that they are citizens and taxpayers of the Philippines and that their rights as organizations and individuals were violated when the rally they participated in on October 6, 2005 was violently dispersed by policemen implementing Batas Pambansa (B.P.) No. 880.\n\nThe second group consists of 26 individual petitioners, Jess del Prado, et al. , in G.R. No. 169848, [2] who allege that they were injured, arrested and detained when a peaceful mass action they held on September 26, 2005 was preempted and violently dispersed by the police. They further assert that on October 5, 2005, a group they participated in marched to Malaca\u00f1ang to protest issuances of the Palace which, they claim, put the country under an \"undeclared\" martial rule, and the protest was likewise dispersed violently and many among them were arrested and suffered injuries.\n\nThe third group, Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), et al ., petitioners in G.R. No. 169881, [3] allege that they conduct peaceful mass actions and that their rights as organizations and those of their individual members as citizens, specifically the right to peaceful assembly, are affected by Batas Pambansa No. 880 and the policy of \"Calibrated Preemptive Response\" (CPR) being followed to implement it.\n\nKMU, et al., claim that on October 4, 2005, a rally KMU co-sponsored was to be conducted at the Mendiola bridge but police blocked them along C.M. Recto and Lepanto Streets and forcibly dispersed them, causing injuries to several of their members. They further allege that on October 6, 2005, a multi-sectoral rally which KMU also co-sponsored was scheduled to proceed along Espa\u00f1a Avenue in front of the University of Santo Tomas and going towards Mendiola bridge. Police officers blocked them along Morayta Street and prevented them from proceeding further. They were then forcibly dispersed, causing injuries on one of them. [4] Three other rallyists were arrested.\n\nAll petitioners assail Batas Pambansa No. 880, some of them in toto and others only Sections 4, 5, 6, 12, 13(a), and 14(a), as well as the policy of CPR. They seek to stop violent dispersals of rallies under the \"no permit, no rally\" policy and the CPR policy recently announced.\nB.P. No. 880, \"The Public Assembly Act of 1985,\" provides:\n\nBatas Pambansa Blg. 880\n\nAn Act Ensuring The Free Exercise By The People Of Their Right Peaceably To Assemble And Petition The Government [And] For Other Purposes\n\nBe it enacted by the Batasang Pambansa in session assembled:\n\nSection 1. Title . -This Act shall be known as \"The Public Assembly Act of 1985.\"\n\nSec. 2.

No. 169848, thus:\nMalaca\u00f1ang Official\nManila, Philippines NEWS\n\nRelease No. 2 September 21, 2005\n\nSTATEMENT OF EXECUTIVE SECRETARY EDUARDO ERMITA\n\nOn Unlawful Mass Actions\n\nIn view of intelligence reports pointing to credible plans of anti-government groups to inflame the political situation, sow disorder and incite people against the duty constituted authorities, we have instructed the PNP as well as the local government units to strictly enforce a \"no permit, no rally\" policy, disperse groups that run afoul of this standard and arrest all persons violating the laws of the land as well as ordinances on the proper conduct of mass actions and demonstrations.\n\nThe rule of calibrated preemptive response is now in force, in lieu of maximum tolerance. The authorities will not stand aside while those with ill intent are herding a witting or unwitting mass of people and inciting them into actions that are inimical to public order, and the peace of mind of the national community.\nUnlawful mass actions will be dispersed. The majority of law-abiding citizens have the right to be protected by a vigilant and proactive government.\n\nWe appeal to the detractors of the government to engage in lawful and peaceful conduct befitting of a democratic society.\n\nThe President's call for unity and reconciliation stands, based on the rule of law.\nPetitioners Bayan, et al., contend that Batas Pambansa No. 880 is clearly a violation of the Constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other human rights treaties of which the Philippines is a signatory. [5]\n\nThey argue that B.P. No. 880 requires a permit before one can stage a public assembly regardless of the presence or absence of a clear and present danger. It also curtails the choice of venue and is thus repugnant to the freedom of expression clause as the time and place of a public assembly form part of the message for which the expression is sought. Furthermore, it is not content-neutral as it does not apply to mass actions in support of the government. The words \"lawful cause,\" \"opinion,\" \"protesting or influencing\" suggest the exposition of some cause not espoused by the government. Also, the phrase \"maximum tolerance\" shows that the law applies to assemblies against the government because they are being tolerated. As a content-based legislation, it cannot pass the strict scrutiny test.\n\nPetitioners Jess del Prado, et al., in turn, argue that B.P. No. 880 is unconstitutional as it is a curtailment of the right to peacefully assemble and petition for redress of grievances because it puts a condition for the valid exercise of that right. It also characterizes public assemblies without a permit as illegal and penalizes them and allows their dispersal. Thus, its provisions are not mere regulations but are actually prohibitions.\n\nFurthermore, the law delegates powers to the Mayor without providing clear standards. The two standards stated in the laws (clear and present danger and imminent and grave danger) are inconsistent.\n\nRegarding the CPR policy, it is void for being an ultra vires act that alters the standard of maximum tolerance set forth in B.P. No. 880, aside from being void for being vague and for lack of publication.\n\nFinally, petitioners KMU, et al. , argue that the Constitution sets no limits on the right to assembly and therefore B.P. No. 880 cannot put the prior requirement of securing a permit. And even assuming that the legislature can set limits to this right, the limits provided are unreasonable: First, allowing the Mayor to deny the permit on clear and convincing evidence of a clear and present danger is too comprehensive. Second, the five-day requirement to apply for a permit is too long as certain events require instant public assembly, otherwise interest on the issue would possibly wane.\n\nAs to the CPR policy, they argue that it is preemptive, that the government takes action even before the rallyists can perform their act, and that no law, ordinance or executive order supports the policy. Furthermore, it contravenes the maximum tolerance policy of B.P. No. 880 and violates the Constitution as it causes a chilling effect on the exercise by the people of the right to peaceably assemble.\n\nRespondents in G.R. No. 169838 are Eduardo Ermita , as Executive Secretary, Manila City Mayor Lito Atienza, Chief, of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Gen. Arturo Lomibao, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Chief, PNP Maj . Gen. Vidal Querol , and Manila Police District (MPD) Chief Gen. Pedro Bulaong.\n\nRespondents in G.R. No. 169848 are Eduardo Ermita as Executive Secretary and in his personal capacity; Angelo Reyes , as Secretary of the Interior and Local Governments; Arturo Lomibao, as Chief Vidal Querol, as Chief, NCRPO; Pedro Bulaong, as Chief, MPD, and all other public officers and private individuals acting under their control, supervision and instruction.\n\nRespondents in G.R. No. 169881 are the Honorable Executive Secretary, PNP Director General Arturo Lomibao , the Honorable Mayor Joselito Atienza, a nd PNP MPD Chief Pedro Bulaong.\n\nRespondents argue that:\nPetitioners have no standing because they have not presented evidence that they had been \"injured, arrested or detained because of the CPR,\" and that \"those arrested stand to be charged with violating Batas Pambansa [No.] 880 and other offenses.\"\n\nNeither B.P. No. 880 nor CPR is void on its face. Petitioners cannot honestly claim that the time, place and manner regulation embodied in B.P. No. 880 violates the three-pronged test for such a measure, to wit: (a) B.P. No. 880 is content-neutral, i.e., it has no reference to content of regulated speech; (b) B.P. No. 880 is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, i.e., the interest cannot be equally well served by a means that is less intrusive of free speech interests; and (c) B.P. No. 880 leaves open alternative channels for communication of the information. [6]\n\nB.P. No. 880 is content-neutral as seen from the text of the law. Section 5 requires the statement of the public assembly's time, place and manner of conduct. It entails traffic re-routing to prevent grave public inconvenience and serious or undue interference in the free flow of commerce and trade. Furthermore, nothing in B.P. No. 880 authorizes the denial of a permit on the basis of a rally's program content or the statements of the speakers therein, except under the constitutional precept of the \"clear and present danger test.\" The status of B.P. No. 880 as a content-neutral regulation has been recognized in Osme\u00f1a v. Comelec. [7]\n\nAdiong v. Comelec [8] held that B.P. No. 880 is a content-neutral regulation of the time, place and manner of holding public assemblies and the law passes the test for such regulation, namely, these regulations need only a substantial governmental interest to support them.\n\nSangalang v. Intermediate Appellate Court [9] held that a local chief executive has the authority to exercise police power to meet \"the demands of the common good in terms of traffic decongestion and public convenience.\" Furthermore, the discretion given to the mayor is narrowly circumscribed by Sections 5 (d), and 6 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), 13 and 15 of the law.\n\nThe standards set forth in the law are not inconsistent. \"Clear and convincing evidence that the public assembly will create a clear and present danger to public order, public safety, public convenience, public morals or public health\" and \"imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil\" both express the meaning of the \"clear and present danger test.\" [10]\n\nCPR is simply the responsible and judicious use of means allowed by existing laws and ordinances to protect public interest and restore public order. Thus, it is not accurate to call it a new rule but rather it is a more pro-active and dynamic enforcement of existing laws, regulations and ordinances to prevent chaos in the streets. It does not replace the rule of maximum tolerance in B.P. No. 880.\nRespondent Mayor Joselito Atienza, for his part, submitted in his Comment that the petition in G.R. No. 169838 should be dismissed on the ground that Republic Act No. 7160 gives the Mayor power to deny a permit independently of B.P. No. 880; that his denials of permits were under the \"clear and present danger' rule as there was a clamor to stop rallies that disrupt the economy and to protect the lives of other people; that J. B. L. Reyes v. Bagatsing , [11] Primicias v. Fugoso , [12] and Jacinto v. CA, [13] have affirmed the constitutionality of requiring a permit; that the permit is for the use of a public place and not for the exercise of rights; and that B.P. No. 880 is not a content-based regulation because it covers all rallies.\n\nThe petitions were ordered consolidated on February 14, 2006. After the submission of all the Comments, the Court set the cases for oral arguments on April 4, 2006, [14] stating the principal issues, as follows:\nOn the constitutionality of Batas Pambansa No. 880, specifically Sections 4, 5, 6, 12 13(a) and 14(a) thereof, and Republic Act No. 7160:\n(a) Are these content-neutral or content-based regulations?\n(b) Are they void on grounds of overbreadth or vagueness?\n(c) Do they constitute prior restraint?\n(d) Are they undue delegations of powers to Mayors?\n(e) Do they violate international human rights treaties and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?\n\nOn the constitutionality and legality of the policy of Calibrated Preemptive Response (CPR):\n(a) Is the policy void on its face or due to vagueness?\n(b) Is it void for lack of publication?\n(c) Is the policy of CPR void as applied to the rallies of September 26 and October 4, 5 and 6, 2005?\nDuring the course of the oral arguments, the following developments took place and were approved and/or noted by the Court:\nPetitioners, in the interest of a speedy resolution of the petitions, withdrew the portions of their petitions raising factual issues, particularly those raising the issue of whether B.P. No. 880 and/or CPR is void as applied to the rallies of September 20, October 4, 5 and 6, 2005.\n\nThe Solicitor General agreed with the observation of the Chief Justice that CPR should no longer be used as a legal term inasmuch as, according to respondents, it was merely a \"catchword\" intended to clarify what was thought to be a misunderstanding of the maximum tolerance policy set forth in B.P. No. 880 and that, as stated in the affidavit executed by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita and submitted to the Ombudsman, it does not replace B.P. No. 880 and the maximum tolerance policy embodied in that law.\nThe Court will now proceed to address the principal issues, taking into account the foregoing developments.\n\nPetitioners' standing cannot be seriously challenged. Their right as citizens to engage in peaceful assembly and exercise the right of petition, as guaranteed by the Constitution, is directly affected by B.P. No. 880 which requires a permit for all who would publicly assemble in the nation's streets and parks. They have, in fact, purposely engaged in public assemblies without the required permits to press their claim that no such permit can be validly required without violating the Constitutional guarantee. Respondents, on the other hand, have challenged such action as contrary to law and dispersed the public assemblies held without the permit.\n\nSection 4 of Article III of the Constitution provides:\nSec. 4. No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.\nThe first point to mark is that the right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances is, together with freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press, a right that enjoys primacy in the realm of constitutional protection. For these rights constitute the very basis of a functional democratic polity, without which all the other rights would be meaningless and unprotected. As stated in Jacinto v. CA, [15] the Court, as early as the onset of this century, in U.S. v. Apurado , [16] already upheld the right to assembly and petition, as follows:\nThere is no question as to the petitioners' rights to peaceful assembly to petition the government for a redress of grievances and, for that matter, to organize or form associations for purposes not contrary to law, as well as to engage in peaceful concerted activities. These rights are guaranteed by no less than the Constitution, particularly Sections 4 and 8 of the Bill of Rights, Section 2(5) of Article IX, and Section 3 of Article XIII. Jurisprudence abounds with hallowed pronouncements defending and promoting the people's exercise of these rights. As early as the onset of this century, this Court in U.S. vs. Apurado , already upheld the right to assembly and petition and even went as far as to acknowledge:\n\n\"It is rather to be expected that more or less disorder will mark the public assembly of the people to protest against grievances whether real or imaginary, because on such occasions feeling is always wrought to a high pitch of excitement, and the greater, the grievance and the more intense the feeling, the less perfect, as a rule will be the disciplinary control of the leaders over their irresponsible followers. But if the prosecution be permitted to seize upon every instance of such disorderly conduct by individual members of a crowd as an excuse to characterize the assembly as a seditious and tumultuous rising against the authorities, then the right to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances would expose all those who took part therein to the severest and most unmerited punishment, if the purposes which they sought to attain did not happen to be pleasing to the prosecuting authorities. If instances of disorderly conduct occur on such occasions, the guilty individuals should be sought out and punished therefor, but the utmost discretion must be exercised in drawing the line between disorderly and seditious conduct and between an essentially peaceable assembly and a tumultuous uprising.\"\nAgain, in Primicias v. Fugoso, [17] the Court likewise sustained the primacy of freedom of speech and to assembly and petition over comfort and convenience in the use of streets and parks.\n\nNext, however, it must be remembered that the right, while sacrosanct, is not absolute. In Primicias, this Court said:\nThe right to freedom of speech, and to peacefully assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances, are fundamental personal rights of the people recognized and guaranteed by the constitutions of democratic countries. But it is a settled principle growing out of the nature of well-ordered civil societies that the exercise of those rights is not absolute for it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having equal rights, nor injurious to the rights of the community or society. The power to regulate the exercise of such and other constitutional rights is termed the sovereign \"police power,\" which is the power to prescribe regulations, to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety, and general welfare of the people. This sovereign police power is exercised by the government through its legislative branch by the enactment of laws regulating those and other constitutional and civil rights, and it may be delegated to political subdivisions, such as towns, municipalities and cities by authorizing their legislative bodies called municipal and city councils enact ordinances for purpose. [18]\nReyes v. Bagatsing [19] further expounded on the right and its limits, as follows:\nIt is thus clear that the Court is called upon to protect the exercise of the cognate rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, arising from the denial of a permit. The Constitution is quite explicit: \"No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for redress of grievances.\" Free speech, like free press, may be identified with the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully any matter of public concern without censorship or punishment. There is to be then no previous restraint on the communication of views or subsequent liability whether in libel suits, prosecution for sedition, or action for damages, or contempt proceedings unless there be a \"clear and present danger of a substantive evil that [the State] has a right to prevent.\" Freedom of assembly connotes the right of the people to meet peaceably for consultation and discussion of matters of public concern. It is entitled to be accorded the utmost deference and respect. It is not to be limited, much less denied, except on a showing, as is the case with freedom of expression, of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil that the state has a right to prevent. Even prior to the 1935 Constitution, Justice Malcolm had occasion to stress that it is a necessary consequence of our republican institutions and complements the right of free speech. To paraphrase the opinion of Justice Rutledge, speaking for the majority of the American Supreme Court in Thomas v. Collins, it was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom of speech and of the press were coupled in a single guarantee with the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances. All these rights, while not identical, are inseparable. In every case, therefore, where there is a limitation placed on the exercise of this right, the judiciary is called upon to examine the effects of the challenged governmental actuation. The sole justification for a limitation on the exercise of this right, so fundamental to the maintenance of democratic institutions, is the danger, of a character both grave and imminent, of a serious evil to public safety, public morals, public health, or any other legitimate public interest.\n\nNowhere is the rationale that underlies the freedom of expression and peaceable assembly better expressed than in this excerpt from an opinion of Justice Frankfurter: \"It must never be forgotten, however, that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment. Back of the guaranty of free speech lay faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the peaceful means for gaining access to the mind. It was in order to avert force and explosions due to restrictions upon rational modes of communication that the guaranty of free speech was given a generous scope. But utterance in a context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution.\" What was rightfully stressed is the abandonment of reason, the utterance, whether verbal or printed, being in a context of violence. It must always be remembered that this right likewise provides for a safety valve, allowing parties the opportunity to give vent to their views, even if contrary to the prevailing climate of opinion. For if the peaceful means of communication cannot be availed of, resort to non-peaceful means may be the only alternative. Nor is this the sole reason for the expression of dissent. It means more than just the right to be heard of the person who feels aggrieved or who is dissatisfied with things as they are. Its value may lie in the fact that there may be something worth hearing from the dissenter. That is to ensure a true ferment of ideas. There are, of course, well-defined limits. What is guaranteed is peaceable assembly. One may not advocate disorder in the name of protest, much less preach rebellion under the cloak of dissent. The Constitution frowns on disorder or tumult attending a rally or assembly. Resort to force is ruled out and outbreaks of violence to be avoided. The utmost calm though is not required. As pointed out in an early Philippine case, penned in 1907 to be precise, United States v. Apurado: \"It is rather to be expected that more or less disorder will mark the public assembly of the people to protest against grievances whether real or imaginary, because on such occasions feeling is always wrought to a high pitch of excitement, and the greater the grievance and the more intense the feeling, the less perfect, as a rule, will be the disciplinary control of the leaders over their irresponsible followers.\" It bears repeating that for the constitutional right to be invoked, riotous conduct, injury to property, and acts of vandalism must be avoided. To give free rein to one's destructive urges is to call for condemnation. It is to make a mockery of the high estate occupied by intellectual liberty in our scheme of values. There can be no legal objection, absent the existence of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil, on the choice of Luneta as the place where the peace rally would start. The Philippines is committed to the view expressed in the plurality opinion, of 1939 vintage of, Justice Roberts in Hague v. CIO: \"Whenever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights and liberties of citizens. The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but must not, in the guise of respondents, be abridged or denied.\" The above excerpt was quoted with approval in Primicias v. Fugoso. Primicias made explicit what was implicit in Municipality of Cavite v. Rojas, a 1915 decision, where this Court categorically affirmed that plazas or parks and streets are outside the commerce of man and thus nullified a contract that leased Plaza Soledad of plaintiff-municipality. Reference was made to such plaza \"being a promenade for public use,\" which certainly is not the only purpose that it could serve. To repeat, there can be no valid reason why a permit should not be granted for the proposed march and rally starting from a public park that is the Luneta.\nNeither can there be any valid objection to the use of the streets to the gates of the US embassy, hardly two blocks away at the Roxas Boulevard. Primicias v. Fugoso has resolved any lurking doubt on the matter. In holding that the then Mayor Fugoso of the City of Manila should grant a permit for a public meeting at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, this Court categorically declared: \"Our conclusion finds support in the decision in the case of Willis Cox v. State of New Hampshire, 312 U.S., 569. In that case, the statute of New Hampshire P.L. chap. 145, section 2, providing that no parade or procession upon any ground abutting thereon, shall be permitted unless a special license therefor shall first be obtained from the selectmen of the town or from licensing committee,\" was construed by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire as not conferring upon the licensing board unfettered discretion to refuse to grant the license, and held valid. And the Supreme Court of the United States, in its decision (1941) penned by Chief Justice Hughes affirming the judgment of the State Supreme Court, held that \"a statute requiring persons using the public streets for a parade or procession to procure a special license therefor from the local authorities is not an unconstitutional abridgment of the rights of assembly or of freedom of speech and press, where, as the statute is construed by the state courts, the licensing authorities are strictly limited, in the issuance of licenses, to a consideration of the time, place, and manner of the parade or procession, with a view to conserving the public convenience and of affording an opportunity to provide proper policing, and are not invested with arbitrary discretion to issue or refuse license, * * *. \"Nor should the point made by Chief Justice Hughes in a subsequent portion of the opinion be ignored: \"Civil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the existence of an organized society maintaining public order without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestricted abuses. The authority of a municipality to impose regulations in order to assure the safety and convenience of the people in the use of public highways has never been regarded as inconsistent with civil liberties but rather as one of the means of safeguarding the good order upon which they ultimately depend. The control of travel on the streets of cities is the most familiar illustration of this recognition of social need. Where a restriction of the use of highways in that relation is designed to promote the public convenience in the interest of all, it cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which in other circumstances would be entitled to protection.\"\nx x x\nx x x The principle under American doctrines was given utterance by Chief Justice Hughes in these words: \"The question, if the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly are to be preserved, is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects.\" There could be danger to public peace and safety if such a gathering were marked by turbulence. That would deprive it of its peaceful character. It is true that the licensing official, here respondent Mayor, is not devoid of discretion in determining whether or not a permit would be granted. It is not, however, unfettered discretion. While prudence requires that there be a realistic appraisal not of what may possibly occur but of what may probably occur, given all the relevant circumstances, still the assumption - especially so where the assembly is scheduled for a specific public place - is that the permit must be for the assembly being held there. The exercise of such a right, in the language of Justice Roberts, speaking for the American Supreme Court, is not to be \"abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\"\nx x x\nBy way of a summary. The applicants for a permit to hold an assembly should inform the licensing authority of the date, the public place where and the time when it will take place. If it were a private place, only the consent of the owner or the one entitled to its legal possession is required. Such application should be filed well ahead in time to enable the public official concerned to appraise whether there may be valid objections to the grant of the permit or to its grant but at another public place. It is an indispensable condition to such refusal or modification that the clear and present danger test be the standard for the decision reached. If he is of the view that there is such an imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil, the applicants must be heard on the matter. Thereafter, his decision, whether favorable or adverse, must be transmitted to them at the earliest opportunity. Thus if so minded, they can have recourse to the proper judicial authority. Free speech and peaceable assembly, along with the other intellectual freedoms, are highly ranked in our scheme of constitutional values. It cannot be too strongly stressed that on the judiciary, -- even more so than on the other departments - rests the grave and delicate responsibility of assuring respect for and deference to such preferred rights. No verbal formula, no sanctifying phrase can, of course, dispense with what has been so felicitiously termed by Justice Holmes \"as the sovereign prerogative of judgment.\" Nonetheless, the presumption must be to incline the weight of the scales of justice on the side of such rights, enjoying as they do precedence and primacy. x x x.\nB.P.

No. 880 is not an absolute ban of public assemblies but a restriction that simply regulates the time, place and manner of the assemblies. This was adverted to in Osme\u00f1a v. Comelec, [20] where the Court referred to it as a \"content-neutral\" regulation of the time, place, and manner of holding public assemblies. [21]\n\nA fair and impartial reading of B.P. No. 880 thus readily shows that it refers to all kinds of public assemblies [22] that would use public places. The reference to \"lawful cause\" does not make it content-based because assemblies really have to be for lawful causes, otherwise they would not be \"peaceable\" and entitled to protection. Neither are the words \"opinion,\" \"protesting\" and \"influencing\" in the definition of public assembly content based, since they can refer to any subject. The words \"petitioning the government for redress of grievances\" come from the wording of the Constitution, so its use cannot be avoided. Finally, maximum tolerance is for the protection and benefit of all rallyists and is independent of the content of the expressions in the rally.\n\nFurthermore, the permit can only be denied on the ground of clear and present danger to public order, public safety, public convenience, public morals or public health. This is a recognized exception to the exercise of the right even under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, thus:\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nArticle 20\nEveryone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\nx x x\n\nArticle 29\nEveryone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.\n\nIn the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.\n\nThese rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n\nArticle 19.\nEveryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.\n\nEveryone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.\n\nThe exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:\n(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;\n(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.\nContrary to petitioner's claim, the law is very clear and is nowhere vague in its provisions. \"Public\" does not have to be defined. Its ordinary meaning is well-known. Webster's Dictionary defines it, thus: [23]\npublic, n, x x x 2a: an organized body of people x x x 3: a group of people distinguished by common interests or characteristics x x x.\nNot every expression of opinion is a public assembly . The law refers to \"rally, demonstration, march, parade, procession or any other form of mass or concerted action held in a public place.\" So it does not cover any and all kinds of gatherings.\n\nNeither is the law overbroad. It regulates the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly and petition only to the extent needed to avoid a clear and present danger of the substantive evils Congress has the right to prevent.\n\nThere is, likewise, no prior restraint, since the content of the speech is not relevant to the regulation.\n\nAs to the delegation of powers to the mayor, the law provides a precise and sufficient standard -the clear and present danger test stated in Sec. 6(a). The reference to \"imminent and grave danger of a substantive evil\" in Sec. 6(c) substantially means the same thing and is not an inconsistent standard. As to whether respondent Mayor has the same power independently under Republic Act No. 7160 [24] is thus not necessary to resolve in these proceedings, and was not pursued by the parties in their arguments.\n\nFinally, for those who cannot wait, Section 15 of the law provides for an alternative forum through the creation of freedom parks where no prior permit is needed for peaceful assembly and petition at any time:\nSec. 15. Freedom parks. - Every city and municipality in the country shall within six months after the effectivity of this Act establish or designate at least one suitable \"freedom park\" or mall in their respective jurisdictions which, as far as practicable, shall be centrally located within the poblacion where demonstrations and meetings may be held at any time without the need of any prior permit.\n\nIn the cities and municipalities of Metropolitan Manila, the respective mayors shall establish the freedom parks within the period of six months from the effectivity this Act.\nThis brings up the point, however, of compliance with this provision.\n\nThe Solicitor General stated during the oral arguments that, to his knowledge, only Cebu City has declared a freedom park \" Fuente Osme\u00f1a.\n\nThat of Manila, the Sunken Gardens, has since been converted into a golf course, he added.\n\nIf this is so, the degree of observance of B.P. No. 880's mandate that every city and municipality set aside a freedom park within six months from its effectivity in 1985, or 20 years ago , would be pathetic and regrettable. The matter appears to have been taken for granted amidst the swell of freedom that rose from the peaceful revolution of 1986.\n\nConsidering that the existence of such freedom parks is an essential part of the law's system of regulation of the people's exercise of their right to peacefully assemble and petition, the Court is constrained to rule that after thirty (30) days from the finality of this Decision, no prior permit may be required for the exercise of such right in any public park or plaza of a city or municipality until that city or municipality shall have complied with Section 15 of the law. For without such alternative forum, to deny the permit would in effect be to deny the right. Advance notices should, however, be given to the authorities to ensure proper coordination and orderly proceedings.\n\nThe Court now comes to the matter of the CPR. As stated earlier, the Solicitor General has conceded that the use of the term should now be discontinued, since it does not mean anything other than the maximum tolerance policy set forth in B.P. No. 880. This is stated in the Affidavit of respondent Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita, submitted by the Solicitor General, thus:\nThe truth of the matter is the policy of \"calibrated preemptive response\" is in consonance with the legal definition of \"maximum tolerance\" under Section 3 (c) of B.P. Blg. 880, which is the \"highest degree of restraint that the military, police and other peacekeeping authorities shall observe during a public assembly or in the dispersal of the same.\" Unfortunately, however, the phrase \"maximum tolerance\" has acquired a different meaning over the years. Many have taken it to mean inaction on the part of law enforcers even in the face of mayhem and serious threats to public order. More so, other felt that they need not bother secure a permit when holding rallies thinking this would be \"tolerated.\" Clearly, the popular connotation of \"maximum tolerance\" has departed from its real essence under B.P. Blg. 880.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the policy of maximum tolerance is provided under the same law which requires all pubic assemblies to have a permit, which allows the dispersal of rallies without a permit, and which recognizes certain instances when water cannons may be used. This could only mean that \"maximum tolerance\" is not in conflict with a \"no permit, no rally policy\" or with the dispersal and use of water cannons under certain circumstances for indeed, the maximum amount of tolerance required is dependent on how peaceful or unruly a mass action is. Our law enforcers should calibrate their response based on the circumstances on the ground with the view to preempting the outbreak of violence.\n\nThus, when I stated that calibrated preemptive response is being enforced in lieu of maximum tolerance I clearly was not referring to its legal definition but to the distorted and much abused definition that it has now acquired. I only wanted to disabuse the minds of the public from the notion that law enforcers would shirk their responsibility of keeping the peace even when confronted with dangerously threatening behavior. I wanted to send a message that we would no longer be lax in enforcing the law but would henceforth follow it to the letter. Thus I said, \" we have instructed the PNP as well as the local government units to strictly enforce a no permit, no rally policy . . . arrest all persons violating the laws of the land . . . unlawful mass actions will be dispersed. \" None of these is at loggerheads with the letter and spirit of Batas Pambansa Blg. 880. It is thus absurd for complainants to even claim that I ordered my co-respondents to violate any law. [25]\nAt any rate, the Court rules that in view of the maximum tolerance mandated by B.P. No. 880, CPR serves no valid purpose if it means the same thing as maximum tolerance and is illegal if it means something else. Accordingly, what is to be followed is and should be that mandated by the law itself, namely, maximum tolerance, which specifically means the following:\nSec. 3. Definition of terms . - For purposes of this Act:\n\nx x x\n\n(c) \"Maximum tolerance\" means the highest degree of restraint that the military, police and other peace keeping authorities shall observe during a public assembly or in the dispersal of the same.\n\nx x x\n\nSec. 9. Non-interference by law enforcement authorities. - Law enforcement agencies shall not interfere with the holding of a public assembly. However, to adequately ensure public safety, a law enforcement contingent under the command of a responsible police officer may be detailed and stationed in a place at least one hundred (100) meters away from the area of activity ready to maintain peace and order at all times.\n\nSec. 10. Police assistance when requested. - It shall be imperative for law enforcement agencies, when their assistance is requested by the leaders or organizers, to perform their duties always mindful that their responsibility to provide proper protection to those exercising their right peaceably to assemble and the freedom of expression is primordial. Towards this end, law enforcement agencies shall observe the following guidelines:\n\n(a) Members of the law enforcement contingent who deal with the demonstrators shall be in complete uniform with their nameplates and units to which they belong displayed prominently on the front and dorsal parts of their uniform and must observe the policy of \"maximum tolerance\" as herein defined;\n\n(b) The members of the law enforcement contingent shall not carry any kind of firearms but may be equipped with baton or riot sticks, shields, crash helmets with visor, gas masks, boots or ankle high shoes with shin guards;\n\n(c) Tear gas, smoke grenades, water cannons, or any similar anti-riot device shall not be used unless the public assembly is attended by actual violence or serious threats of violence, or deliberate destruction of property.\n\nSec. 11. Dispersal of public assembly with permit . - No public assembly with a permit shall be dispersed. However, when an assembly becomes violent, the police may disperse such public assembly as follows:\n\n(a) At the first sign of impending violence, the ranking officer of the law enforcement contingent shall call the attention of the leaders of the public assembly and ask the latter to prevent any possible disturbance;\n\n(b) If actual violence starts to a point where rocks or other harmful objects from the participants are thrown at the police or at the non-participants, or at any property causing damage to such property, the ranking officer of the law enforcement contingent shall audibly warn the participants that if the disturbance persists, the public assembly will be dispersed;\n\n(c) If the violence or disturbance prevailing as stated in the preceding subparagraph should not stop or abate, the ranking officer of the law enforcement contingent shall audibly issue a warning to the participants of the public assembly, and after allowing a reasonable period of time to lapse, shall immediately order it to forthwith disperse;\n\n(d) No arrest of any leader, organizer or participant shall also be made during the public assembly unless he violates during the assembly a law, statute, ordinance or any provision of this Act. Such arrest shall be governed by Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended;\n\n(d) Isolated acts or incidents of disorder or breach of the peace during the public assembly may be peacefully dispersed.\n\nx x x\n\nSec. 12. Dispersal of public assembly without permit. - When the public assembly is held without a permit where a permit is required, the said public assembly may be peacefully dispersed.\n\nSec. 13. Prohibited acts . - The following shall constitute violations of the Act:\n\n(e) Obstructing, impeding, disrupting or otherwise denying the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly;\n\n(f) The unnecessary firing of firearms by a member of any law enforcement agency or any person to disperse the public assembly;\n\n(g) Acts described hereunder if committed within one hundred (100) meters from the area of activity of the public assembly or on the occasion thereof:\n\nx x x\nthe carrying of firearms by members of the law enforcement unit;\n\nthe interfering with or intentionally disturbing the holding of a public assembly by the use of a motor vehicle, its horns and loud sound systems.\nFurthermore, there is need to address the situation adverted to by petitioners where mayors do not act on applications for a permit and when the police demand a permit and the rallyists could not produce one, the rally is immediately dispersed. In such a situation, as a necessary consequence and part of maximum tolerance, rallyists who can show the police an application duly filed on a given date can, after two days from said date, rally in accordance with their application without the need to show a permit, the grant of the permit being then presumed under the law, and it will be the burden of the authorities to show that there has been a denial of the application, in which case the rally may be peacefully dispersed following the procedure of maximum tolerance prescribed by the law.\n\nIn sum, this Court reiterates its basic policy of upholding the fundamental rights of our people, especially freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In several policy addresses, Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban has repeatedly vowed to uphold the liberty of our people and to nurture their prosperity. He said that \"in cases involving liberty, the scales of justice should weigh heavily against the government and in favor of the poor, the oppressed, the marginalized, the dispossessed and the weak. Indeed, laws and actions that restrict fundamental rights come to the courts with a heavy presumption against their validity. These laws and actions are subjected to heightened scrutiny.\" [26]\n\nFor this reason, the so-called calibrated preemptive response policy has no place in our legal firmament and must be struck down as a darkness that shrouds freedom. It merely confuses our people and is used by some police agents to justify abuses. On the other hand, B.P. No. 880 cannot be condemned as unconstitutional; it does not curtail or unduly restrict freedoms; it merely regulates the use of public places as to the time, place and manner of assemblies. Far from being insidious, \"maximum tolerance\" is for the benefit of rallyists, not the government. The delegation to the mayors of the power to issue rally \"permits\" is valid because it is subject to the constitutionally-sound \"clear and present danger\" standard.\n\nIn this Decision, the Court goes even one step further in safeguarding liberty by giving local governments a deadline of 30 days within which to designate specific freedom parks as provided under B.P. No. 880. If, after that period, no such parks are so identified in accordance with Section 15 of the law, all public parks and plazas of the municipality or city concerned shall in effect be deemed freedom parks; no prior permit of whatever kind shall be required to hold an assembly therein. The only requirement will be written notices to the police and the mayor's office to allow proper coordination and orderly activities.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petitions are GRANTED in part, and respondents, more particularly the Secretary of the Interior and Local Governments, are DIRECTED to take all necessary steps for the immediate compliance with Section 15 of Batas Pambansa No. 880 through the establishment or designation of at least one suitable freedom park or plaza in every city and municipality of the country. After thirty (30) days from the finality of this Decision, subject to the giving of advance notices, no prior permit shall be required to exercise the right to peaceably assemble and petition in the public parks or plazas of a city or municipality that has not yet complied with Section 15 of the law. Furthermore, Calibrated Preemptive Response (CPR) , insofar as it would purport to differ from or be in lieu of maximum tolerance, is NULL and VOID and respondents are ENJOINED to REFRAIN from using it and to STRICTLY OBSERVE the requirements of maximum tolerance. The petitions are DISMISSED in all other respects, and the constitutionality of Batas Pambansa No. 880 is SUSTAINED.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Garcia, and Velasco, Jr. , JJ., concur.\nPuno, J ., on leave.\nChico-Nazario, J. , on official leave.\n\n[1] Petition for Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order filed by Bayan, Karapatan, Kilusang Magbubukid Ng Pilipinas (KMP), COURAGE, GABRIELA, Fr.

NO. 05-5-05-CA, January 27, 2006 ]\n\nRE: ALLEGED ILLEGAL ACQUISITION OF A CAREER SERVICE ELIGIBILITY BY MA. AURORA P. SANTOS, RECORDS OFFICER I, COURT OF APPEALS,\nD E C I S I O N\nRE: ALLEGED ILLEGAL ACQUISITION OF A CAREER SERVICE ELIGIBILITY BY MA. AURORA P. SANTOS, RECORDS OFFICER I, COURT OF APPEALS,\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nAurora P. Santos, Records Officer I of the Court of Appeals, joined the said office in 1984 as a temporary employee. In 1994, she became a permanent employee upon presentation of a certificate of civil service eligibility stating that she passed the October 17, 1993 Career Service Professional Examination in Quezon City. [1]\n\nOn January 20, 2005, Santos requested [2] for an authenticated copy of her civil service eligibility. Upon authentication by the Integrated Records Management Office of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), [3] it was noted that \"Aurora P. Santos\" referred to in the Picture Seat Plan (PSP) of the examinees was a \"male.\" [4]\n\nThe CSC thus required Santos to show cause and explain why she should not be held administratively liable for employing fraud in the acquisition of her career service eligibility.\n\nSantos admitted that she solicited the help of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfixers\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd after repeatedly failing the civil service examination. She insisted though that she was unaware of the scheme employed by the fixers of allowing another person to take the examination in her place. She begged for compassion and mercy so that she will not be charged administratively.\n\nOn May 11, 2005, Commissioner J. Waldemar V. Valmores of the CSC endorsed the case of Santos to this Court in view of our disciplinary authority over court personnel. [5] We referred the matter to Justice Romulo S. Quimbo, Consultant, Office of the Court Administrator, for investigation, report and recommendation. [6]\n\nIn his report, the Investigating Justice found that Santos employed dishonest means in procuring her civil service eligibility [7] and recommended her dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all retirement privileges, except accrued leaves, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in any division or instrumentality of the government or in any government owned or controlled corporation. [8]\n\nWe adopt the findings and recommendation of the Investigating Justice. The evidence, coupled with Santos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd admission, sufficiently established her dishonesty and grave misconduct. It is clear that she knew all along that her certificate of eligibility was spurious and was obtained through illegal means. Her claim of good faith deserves no credence.\n\nUnder Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, dishonesty and grave misconduct are grave offenses punishable by dismissal even if committed for the first time. In particular, we held in Civil Service Commission, NCR v. Sta. Ana, [9] that the use of a false certificate of eligibility constitutes an act of dishonesty under civil service rules warranting the penalty of dismissal.\n\nThe Code of Conduct for Court Personnel stresses that employees of the judiciary serve as sentinels of justice and any act of impropriety on their part immeasurably affects the honor and dignity of the Judiciary and the people's confidence in it. Although every office in the government service is a public trust, no position exacts a greater demand for moral righteousness and uprightness from an individual than in the judiciary. [10]\n\nEvery employee of the judiciary should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty. Like any public servant, he must exhibit the highest sense of honesty and integrity not only in the performance of his official duties but in his personal and private dealings with other people, to preserve the court\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds good name and standing. It cannot be overstressed that the image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the personnel who work thereat, from the judge to the lowest of its personnel. Court employees have been enjoined to adhere to the exacting standards of morality and decency in their professional and private conduct in order to preserve the good name and integrity of courts of justice. [11]\n\nWHEREFORE , Aurora P. Santos, Records Officer I of the Court of Appeals is ordered DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement privileges, except accrued leaves, with prejudice from re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Puno, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 11.\n\n[2] Id . at 9-10.\n\n[3] Id . at 5.\n\n[4] Id . at 7.\n\n[5] Id . at 3-4.\n\n[6] Id . at 31.\n\n[7] Id . at 41.\n\n[8] Id . at 42-43.\n\n[9] 435 Phil. 1, 11 (2002).\n\n[10] Rabe v.

NO. 05-8-233-MTC, January 31, 2006 ]\n\nRE: FINAL REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED AT THE MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT OF MIDSAYAP, NORTH COTABATO,D E C I S I O N\nRE: FINAL REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED AT THE MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT OF MIDSAYAP, NORTH COTABATO,\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nSince May 1998, Clerk of Court II Joselito S. Fontilla (Fontilla) of the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Midsayap, North Cotabato, failed to submit the monthly reports of collections and deposits to the Accounting Division, Financial Management Office. [1] Thus, on May 31, 2004, an audit team proceeded to Midsayap, North Cotabato to conduct a cash count. [2]\n\nIn the course of the audit, the team required Freddie C. Eruela (Eruela), Clerk II of MTC-Midsayap, to produce the necessary documents as he was allegedly in-charge of the collections in the absence of Fontilla but he disclaimed knowledge of the whereabouts of the documents. However, when some members of the audit team returned to Midsayap on June 2, 2004, they found the missing documents in a sack under Eruela's table. This time, Eruela admitted that he had been assisting Fontilla in the collections and deposits of the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) and Fiduciary Fund (FF).\n\nIn the investigation conducted by Presiding Judge Teresita Carreon-Llaban (Judge Carreon-Llaban), Eruela admitted that he altered the entries in the passbook of Savings Account (SA) No. 1001-0360-64 and made it appear that the total collections were deposited. He confessed that he and his officemates borrowed from the collections of the court; that some were erroneously deposited to the JDF account while the rest were stolen. [ 3]\n\nIn the report dated November 30, 2004, [4] the audit team noted that: (1) collections amounting to P3,060.00 were deposited to their corresponding fund accounts only after the cash count audit; (2) Fontilla did not submit the monthly reports for the FF and the General Fund (GF) while the last monthly report submitted for the JDF was in April 1998; (3) MTC-Midsayap started collecting fees for the GF only in October 2003 despite the mandate of Administrative Circular No. 11-94 dated June 28, 1994 to start collecting on August 1, 1994; (4) several official receipts were missing; (5) interest earned from the FF deposits from November 1996 to March 2004 (excluding the period July 2000 to June 2001 when the passbook for this deposit was missing) in the amount of P24,636.11 was not remitted to the JDF; (6) collections amounting to P174,000.00 were not deposited to the FF account and several entries in the passbook for SA No. 1001-0360-64 were altered to make it appear that the amounts deposited equal the amounts collected; and (7) the total accountability of Fontilla is P182,013.25 for the JDF and P298,086.72 for the FF.\n\nIn a Memorandum dated November 30, 2004, [5] Deputy Court Administrator Christopher O. Lock (DCA Lock) directed Eruela to explain his failure to submit for audit the documents relative to the cash count and the alterations found in the passbooks. [6] Eruela explained that he personally helped the team look for the audit documents. When they could not find the documents and after the team had left, he continued looking and found the documents inside the stock room. He stated that these were the sacks the team saw under his table. He alleged that he altered the entries in the passbook with no malice or intent to defraud and that he intended to pay any deficiency. [7]\n\nIn another Memorandum dated December 7, 2004, [8] DCA Lock directed Fontilla to explain his continued defiance in submitting the required monthly reports; his failure to collect the fees accruing to the GF from August 1, 1994 to September 30, 2003; and the alterations in the passbook of SA No. 1001-0360-64. Fontilla was also directed to account for the missing official receipts, as well as submit the missing passbook covering the period from August 10, 2000 to August 16, 2001, supporting documents of all FF withdrawals and other proofs of remittances to the JDF. Finally, Fontilla was ordered to pay the amounts of P182,013.25 and P298,086.76, representing the balance of his accountability for the JDF and the FF, respectively.\n\nIn a Memorandum dated August 15, 2005, [9] the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recomputed the accountability of Fontilla and found that it amounted to P2,855,987.36. Likewise, it found Fontilla accountable for the missing and unaccounted official receipts.\nThe OCA thus recommended [10]\nto docket the audit report as a regular administrative complaint against Fontilla and Eruela;\n\nto direct Fontilla to pay P182,013.25 and P2,673,974.11 representing his accountabilities for the JDF and FF and submit to the Fiscal Monitoring Division the unaccounted official receipts; [11]\n\nto adopt the recommendations of Judge Carreon-Llaban that Eruela be ordered to restitute the amount of P56,000.00 representing the altered amount of deposits and be suspended pending resolution of the administrative matter;\n\nto direct Alcantara to withdraw the interest income of FF deposits amounting to P24,636.11 and deposit the same to the JDF account; submit to the Fiscal Monitoring Division the corresponding withdrawal and deposit slips as proofs of compliance; exert all efforts to locate the unaccounted official receipts;\n\nto direct the National Bureau of Investigation to locate Fontilla and serve him a copy of the resolution of the Court on this matter; and\n\nto issue a Hold Departure Order against Fontilla and Eruela.\n\nWe agree with the findings of the OCA. Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. [12] Those charged with the dispensation of justice, from the justices and judges to the lowliest clerks, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. Not only must their conduct at all times be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, it must be beyond suspicion. [13]\n\nFontilla misappropriated the collections for the FF and JDF amounting to P2,673,974.11 and P182,013.25 respectively; failed to submit the monthly reports despite orders from the court; failed to collect fees accruing to the GF from August 1, 1994 to September 30, 2003; altered the passbooks of SA No. 1001-0360-64; neglected to keep the official receipts of the court; and has been absent from work without filing leave of absence.\n\nIt appears that in the Resolution of this Court dated March 30, 2005 [14] in Administrative Matter No. 05-2-37-MTC, [15] Fontilla was dropped from the rolls for having been absent without official leave since September 1, 2003 and his position as Clerk of Court II was declared vacant.\n\nAs regards Eruela, it is clear that he took advantage of his position. The audit report and the preliminary investigation show that he assisted Fontilla in the collection and deposit of the JDF and FF; hid the necessary documents from the audit team; altered the entries in the passbook of SA No. 1001-0360-64; appropriated the money from the collections of the court; and kept the altered deposit slips inside his drawer. His protestation that he acted without malice is inconsistent with his acts of misappropriating the judiciary funds and altering the entries in the passbook to make it appear that the collections were deposited intact.\n\nNo position demands greater moral righteousness and uprightness from the occupant than does the judicial office. [16] The safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly administration of justice and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the Circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds. The failure to remit the funds in due time constitutes gross dishonesty and gross misconduct and even malversation of funds which cannot be countenanced by the Court for they diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary. [17] The act of misappropriating judiciary funds constitutes dishonesty and grave misconduct which are grave offenses punished by dismissal [18] even if committed for the first time. [19]\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, (1) Respondents Joselito S. Fontilla and Clerk II Freddie C. Eruela are found GUILTY of grave misconduct and dishonesty; (2) Respondent Freddie C. Eruela is ordered DISMISSED from the service effective immediately. All his retirement benefits, excluding earned leave credits, are ordered forfeited in favor of the government with prejudice to reemployment in any government office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. He is further ordered to restitute the amount of P56,000.00 representing the altered amount of deposits; (3) The Employees Leave Division, Office of Administrative Services-OCA is DIRECTED to compute the balance of respondent Freddie C. Eruela's accrued leave credits and forward the same to the Finance Division, Fiscal Management Office-OCA for the computation of its monetary value. The resulting amount, as well as other monetary benefits Eruela may still be entitled to, shall be applied as part of the restitution of the shortage; (4) Respondent Joselito S. Fontilla is directed to RESTITUTE the amount of P2,855,987.36 representing the unaccounted shortages in the Fiduciary Fund (P2,431,887.39) and Judiciary Development Fund (P182,013.25) and to SUBMIT to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office, this Office, the following unaccounted official receipts: 7844501-7844550; 7844551-7844600; 7844601-7844650; 7844651-7844700; 7844851-7844900; 7844901-7844950; 7844951-7845000; 5312501-5312550; 6356351-6356400; 9875001-9875050; 9875051-9875100; 11923451-11923500; 18121301-18121350; 18121401-18121450; 18121701-18121750; (5) Officer-in-Charge Jaime S. Alcantara is DIRECTED to withdraw the interest income of the Fiduciary Fund account and deposit the same to the Judiciary Development Fund; submit to the Fiscal Monitoring Division the corresponding withdrawal and deposit slips as proof of compliance and exert all efforts to locate the unaccounted official receipts; (6) The National Bureau of Investigation is DIRECTED to locate Joselito S. Fontilla and serve him a copy of this Decision; (7) The Office of the Court Administrator is DIRECTED to coordinate with the Department of Justice to ensure the expeditious prosecution of the criminal liabilities of respondents Joselito S. Fontilla and Freddie C. Eruela; (8) The Bureau of Immigration is DIRECTED to issue a Hold-Departure Order against respondents Joselito S. Fontilla and Freddie C. Eruela to prevent them from leaving the country.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Puno, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 1.\n\n[2] Id. at 13.\n\n[3] Id. at 43.\n\n[4] Id. at 13-20.\n\n[5] Id . at 36.\n\n[6] Id.\n\n[7] Id . at 39-40.\n\n[8] Id . at 33-34.\n\n[9] Id . at 1-15.\n\n[10] Id . at 4-5.\n\n[11] 7844501-7844550; 7844551-7844600; 7844601-7844650; 7844651-7844700; 7844851-7844900; 7844901-7844950; 7844951-7845000; 5312501-5312550; 6356351-6356400; 9875001-9875050; 9875051-9875100; 11923451-11923500; 18121301-18121350; 18121401-18121450; 18121701-18121750.\n\n[12] CONSTITUTION, Art.

NO. 165476, March 10, 2006 ]\n\nAGRIPINO V. MOLINA, PETITIONER, VS. PACIFIC PLANS, INC., RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nAGRIPINO V. MOLINA, PETITIONER, VS. PACIFIC PLANS, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision [1] and Resolution [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 81298 reversing the Decision [3] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC-NCR (South) Case No. 30-07-03393-01.\n\nPacific Plans, Inc. (PPI) is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of selling pre-need plans, such as educational, pension, and memorial plans. [4] It maintains regional offices throughout the Philippines.\u00a0 At the time material to this case, Metro Manila regional offices were divided into two sales divisions \u2014 the South Sales Division and the North Sales Division. Metro Manila VI was part of the North Sales Division. [5] Among the corporate officers of PPI were Geoffrey Martinez, Executive Vice-President for Finance; Luciano Abia, Senior Assistant Vice-President, Metro Manila Marketing Division; and Atty. Manuel Reyes, the Head of the Legal Department. [6] Roy Padiernos then occupied the position of Regional Manager of Metro Manila VI. [7]\n\nPPI solicited subscribers and buyers of its pre-need plans through clusters of sales associates.\u00a0 One of them was Ruth Padiernos, wife of Roy Padiernos. [8]\n\nSometime in October 1994, PPI hired Agripino Molina as Regional Manager of Metro Manila VI, replacing Roy Padiernos who was promoted as First Vice-President for Marketing Operations. As Regional Manager, Molina performed both administrative and marketing functions, whose duties and responsibilities included the following:\nformulating and recommending short and long range marketing plans for the Region and executing approved plans;\ngenerating new and conserving existing pre-need plan businesses;\nmotivating, training, and developing a dedicated and effective counselor force;\nconducting researches to determine sales potentials and share of the market, pricing, and profitability of Company's products, competition and the directing of product development for the Region;\nhiring and terminating counselors, unit managers or group managers in accordance with policies previously laid out;\nrecommending the creation of additional positions or termination of services of any employee within the Region;\nrecommending promotions or changes in salaries of personnel within the Region and lateral shifts of supervisor, their assistants, understudies of positions of equal rank;\ntraining and developing understudies for each position within the Region to provide immediate replacement whenever vacated;\nchanging methods and procedures not affecting the other Regions, provided, however, that radical changes should first be cleared with [the] superior;\ncontrolling the operations of the Region and establishing a system of periodic work reporting;\ncoordinating the Region's activities with those of the other Regions;\nkeeping [the] superior informed of [the] Region's activities and specially of [the] decision on matters for which he may be held responsible;\nrealizing the Company's objective for service, growth, and profit;\nestablishing and maintaining harmonious and dignified relationship with plan holders, counselors, employees, the public, government instrumentalities, other pre-need plan companies; [and]\nfurther enhancing the prestige of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Company\u00a0 and\u00a0 maintaining\u00a0 its position of leadership in its field. [9] Since Metro Manila VI was consistently on top in terms of nationwide sales and productivity, Molina was promoted Assistant Vice-President with the same functions as those of a regional manager of the same sales region. [10]\n\nCaritas Health Shield, Inc. (Caritas for brevity), a health maintenance organization (HMO) engaged in selling health and hospitalization plans, was established on December 16, 1998. Geoffrey Martinez resigned as Executive Vice-President of PPI and became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Caritas. [11] Among the incorporators and members of the Board of Directors were Luciano Abia and Atty. Manuel Reyes. [12] Molina was hired as Assistant Vice-President and Marketing Head of Area 10.\u00a0 His wife, Fe Molina, was the head of a sales agency of Caritas.\n\nIn the meantime, from February 2000, there was a considerable decrease in the sales output production of PPI's Metro Manila Region VI. [13]\n\nOn March 21, 2000, Molina received a Memorandum from PPI, through its Senior Assistant Vice-President for Human Relations, Patricio A. Picazo, informing him that, based on written reports, he committed the following: 1) recruiting and pirating activities in favor of Caritas, in particular, initiating talks and enticing associates to join Caritas, and a number of associates have already signed up; 2) he called for a meeting with his associates sometime in November 1999, and solicited contributions from them for the bill but later asked for reimbursement from the company; and 3) acts of misdemeanor on several occasions, such as coming to the office under the influence of liquor, initiating a smear campaign against PPI, and other acts inimical to the company's interest. [14] Molina was also required to submit, on March 23, 2000, a written explanation why he should not be held administratively liable for said acts which, it opined, might constitute conduct unbecoming of an officer, conflict of interest, and breach of trust and\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0confidence. Molina was also informed that he was preventively suspended pending formal investigation effective immediately until April 24, 2000. [14]\n\nIn a letter addressed to Picazo dated March 22, 2000, Molina categorically denied the acts attributed to him.\u00a0 He, however, requested that he be furnished with copies of the alleged written reports to enable him to prepare the required written explanation. [16] However, instead of acceding to the request of copies of the written reports, Picazo wrote a letter dated April 3, 2000, citing the particulars of the charges against Molina, thus:\nI. Conflict of Interest\nRecruiting and pirating activities in favor of Caritas Health Shield, Inc.\n* You have acted as conduit for Caritas in recruiting/pirating Mr. Restie Acosta on March 04, 2000 and Ms. Eppie Acosta on March 06, 2000.\n*Your failure to stop and/or tolerating your wife's activities in recruiting for Caritas Ms. Lennie Gatmaitan who belongs to Ms. Celeste Villena, a PPI GA.\n\nII. Misappropriation of Funds\nSolicitation of associates' personal funds in the amount of P200.00 per person, to which 12 persons contributed for a total P2,400.00, for payment of official function during the meeting held at Barrio Fiesta last November 27, 1999. Amount solicited was subsequently reimbursed from the company but not returned to the associates concerned.\nIII.Dereliction of Duties\nYou failed to prevent associates from leaving the company in favor of competitors, thus causing demoralization among your sales associates.\nYou even encouraged associates to transfer to Caritas.\nIV. Conduct unbecoming of a Company Officer\nOften reporting to office under the influence of liquor.\nSowing intrigue in the case of Vilma del Rosario which almost caused her early retirement from the company and transfer to Caritas.\nSowing intrigues between Mr. Roy Padiernos and Mr. Abia.\nShowing disrespect to immediate superior, Mr. Roy Padiernos, by shouting at him and walking out in one of the meetings called by him after the retirement of Atty. Haceta. [17]\nDuring the investigation the following day, April 4, 2000, Molina reiterated his request to be provided with a copy of the written reports. [17] Picazo denied the request in a Memorandum dated April 6, 2000, and reiterated his order for Molina to submit his written explanation on April 11, 2000, and to address his concerns during the investigation scheduled on April 14, 2000. [19] Molina failed to submit any written explanation.\u00a0 On April 24, 2000, PPI issued a Memorandum advising Molina that he would be reinstated in the payroll effective April 25, 2000 without requiring him to report for work during the pendency of his investigation. [20]\n\nMolina filed a \"Motion to Dismiss Complaints and Motion for Full Reinstatement\" on May 2, 2000. [21] He asserted that the charges should be dismissed since he was compelled to prepare a written explanation on the basis of \"summarized specific acts,\" denying him the right to be informed of the exact charges and to confront those who made written reports against him.\u00a0 As to the issue of reinstatement, he alleged that he should be allowed to report for work, conformably with Rule XIV, Section 4 of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code. [22]\n\nOn May 11, 2000, Picazo wrote Molina that his motion to dismiss the charges would be resolved after the investigation.\u00a0 He was warned that his non-appearance at the investigation would be considered a waiver of his right to be heard. [23]\n\nOn the same day, May 11, 2000, Abia issued an inter-office Memorandum announcing the appointment of Sercy F. Picache as the Officer-In-Charge (OIC) for Metro VI and XVI effective May 6, 2000. [24]\n\nMolina and his counsel attended the May 19, 2000 investigation and filed a Motion to Suspend Proceedings, [25] praying that the administrative investigation be deferred until the resolution of the \"prejudicial\" issues raised in his previous motion. [26]\n\nWhen Picazo failed to respond, Molina filed, on June 1, 2000, a complaint for damages with a prayer for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction based on Article 19 of the New Civil Code.\u00a0 PPI filed a Motion to Dismiss, maintaining that the courts have no jurisdiction over matters arising from employee-employer relationship.\u00a0 The trial court denied the motion as well as PPI's motion for reconsideration. [27]\n\nMeanwhile, in letter dated June 13, 2000, Molina was notified of the termination of administrative investigation.\u00a0 PPI considered his failure to submit a written explanation as a waiver of his right to be heard, and as such, the investigating committee had evaluated the evidence at hand and submitted its recommendations to the \"higher management\" for decision.\u00a0 Also, it confirmed the denial of his Motion to Suspend Proceedings. [28]\n\nOn June 23, 2000, the trial court issued an Order granting Molina's prayer for temporary restraining order, which was later made permanent per its Order dated July 12, 2000.\u00a0 The motion for reconsideration filed by PPI on July 26, 2000 was likewise denied. Thereafter, it filed a petition for certiorari before the CA, assailing the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC and its order denying the motion to dismiss the complaint.\u00a0 On July 16, 2001, the CA rendered judgment in favor of PPI and nullified the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC as well as the order denying the motion of PPI for the dismissal of the complaint. [28]\n\nOn July 30, 2001, PPI resolved to dismiss Molina from employment on its finding that the latter violated its standard operating procedure. [30]\n\nMolina forthwith filed a complaint with the NLRC against PPI and Alfredo C. Antonio, Patricio A. Picazo, and Certerio B. Uy, in their capacity as President, Senior Assistant Vice-President of Human Resources Development, and Division Head, respectively, for illegal dismissal and illegal suspension with claim for monetary benefits.\n\nIn his Position Paper, [31] Molina principally argued that he was denied the right to due process due to the failure of PPI to furnish him a copy of the written reports of the sales associates and co-employees, the basis of the accusations against him.\u00a0 Since an OIC for his position was already appointed even before all his pending motions were resolved, he surmised that there were really no such reports, and that the alleged accusations were merely concocted in order to replace him with someone close to Picazo.\u00a0 Molina maintained that since he was denied the opportunity to dispute the authenticity and substantive contents of the reports, his alleged violations of company rules and policies were hearsay and, therefore, lacked probative value.\u00a0 Besides, the termination of his employment was made without the 30-day prior notice; his dismissal from employment took effect immediately, only six days after PPI received the CA decision decreeing that the NLRC has the rightful jurisdiction over the case.\u00a0 Thus, he prayed for the following relief:\nTotal Money Claims\na)\u00a0 Salary with (overriding) commission from March 21 to April 24, 2000 \u2014 suspended w/o pay \u2014 P45,000.00 (P25,000[.00] mo. salary & P20,000[.00] [overriding])\nb)\u00a0 Unpaid (overriding) commission from April 25, 2000 to present \u2014 P400,000[.00]\nc)\u00a0 Unpaid salary from August 1, 2001 to present \u2014 P125,000[.00]\nd)\u00a0 One mo. salary for every yr. of service in lieu of reinstatement \u2014 7 years = P175,000.00\nLeave Credits \u2014 P100,000.00 for 7 years\nProfit Bonus for Year 2000 & 2001 \u2014 P400,000.00\nMoral Damages \u2014 P300,000.00\nExemplary Damages \u2014 P500,000.00\nActual Damages \u2014 for lifetime medical attendance and medicines at 16 more years life expectancy \u2014 P1,249,384.00\nAttorney's Fees \u2014 P300,000.00\nAmount debited from complainant's ATM [as partial payment for hospitalization expenses incurred by him which PPI had advanced] \u2014 P12,000.00\nRetention of complainant's car, as additional penalty for illegal dismissal. [32] For its part, PPI stressed that Caritas was its competitor in the pre-need plans business, and that Molina and his wife recruited and enticed some of the sales associates of PPI to work for Caritas, in violation of its policy against conflict of interest.\u00a0 Some of these sales associates were the spouses Eppie and Restie Acosta, Lenita Gatmaitan, Lolita Casaje, Lydia Magalso, Lydia San Miguel, and Alice Halili, and including Vilma del Rosario, the secretary of Roy Padiernos.\u00a0 PPI, likewise, averred that Molina had the habit of coming to the office under the influence of liquor; he constantly shouted to lady employees and solicited money from his sales associates in\u00a0 connection with an official company function without returning the same after PPI reimbursed him for the expenses incurred; disseminated intrigues and created divisiveness among the employees and PPI's senior officers; and disrespected Padiernos, his superior, by shouting at him during one of the meetings with other senior officers, and walked out of the meeting afterwards.\u00a0 Supporting its claims that Molina committed breach of trust, serious misconduct, fraud, and gross neglect of duty by reason thereof, PPI appended to its position paper the statements/affidavits of Marivic Uy, Ruth and Roy Padiernos, Eppie and Restie Acosta, Celeste Villena, and Vilma del Rosario. [33]\n\nOn the claim of Molina that he was denied due process, PPI averred that he was given sufficient opportunity to present his personal submissions before finally issuing the notice of dismissal but Molina persistently refused to submit his explanation. [34] PPI further argued that he was not entitled to the payment of 13th and 14th month salaries, overriding commission, profit bonus, actual, moral or exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. PPI maintained that, under Article 217(a) of the Labor Code, as amended, and the ruling of this Court in Ba\u00f1ez v. Valdevilla, [35] Molina should be held liable for P1,000,000 as moral damages and an amount not less than P428,400.00 for the salary he received during the time when the restraining order/ writ of injunction was erroneously enforced. [36]\n\nIn his Reply, Molina averred that the affidavits submitted by PPI were antedated since he was never furnished copies of said reports/affidavits despite demands. PPI even failed to present the reports/affidavits before the RTC where his complaint for damages against PPI and its officers was pending. He and Roy Padiernos had been at odds because the latter appointed his brother and wife as agency manager and group manager of PPI to which he objected.\u00a0 Molina averred that the P200.00 collected from each of the employees of PPI during their luncheon meeting was a voluntary contribution, and that they spent P4,000.00, more than the amount collected from the employees. He contended that he had no motive to recruit sales associates or employees of PPI to be employed by Caritas because the depletion of sales associates would diminish his effectiveness as an area manager, including his overriding commission, profit bonus and fringe benefits.\u00a0 He admitted that he may have raised his voice in the heat of arguing a point during meetings, but averred that it should not be considered as disrespect or misdemeanor.\n\nMolina further emphasized that Caritas was not a competitor of PPI, as the former was engaged in selling health care and is supervised by the Department of Health (DOH), while the latter is into the business of selling pre-need plans and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Finally, he averred that the so-called \"associates\" of PPI were not actually employees but \"independent journeymen\" who derived income on commission basis, free to engage in any kind of selling activities not in direct competition with PPI.\n\nMolina admitted having had drinking sessions with Certerio Uy, Ilustre Acosta and Reynaldo Villena, who provided the hard liquor and pulutan , but only after office hours. He claimed that his officemates mistook him for being drunk when he went to his office even after office hours because of his \" mestizo complexion. \"\n\nIn its response, PPI averred that, based on the sales data, the acts of Molina caused demoralization of the sales associates, resulting in a sudden decrease of the region's output from P343,009,643.00 in 1998 to P263,099,773.00 in 1999, and P228,752,090.00 in 2000. [37] PPI insisted that he should be held liable for not less than P507,348.00, P2,000,000, and P1,000,000 as actual, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, respectively, and P273,600.00 which was the balance on his car plan agreement with PPI. [38]\n\nIn his Rejoinder [39] and Sur-Rejoinder [40] Molina submitted the affidavit of Geoffrey Martinez, who belied the reports of Uy, Villena, Del Rosario, and the spouses Padiernos and Acosta. [41] He also appended the affidavits of Natividad Gatchalian, [42] San Miguel, [43] Gatmaitan, [44] and Magalso, [45] who all disputed, in one way or another, Molina's alleged violations.\u00a0 To counter the imputations of conflict of interest, Molina also alleged that Abia and Atty.\u00a0 Reyes were incorporators of Caritas, [46] and that Villena had in her possession a license to sell Caritas products. [47] With regard to the declining sales output of his region, Molina attributed the same to the Asian regional crisis that hit the Philippines sometime in 1997.\u00a0 He noted, however, that the same records revealed that despite the financial bane, Metro VI still managed to be on top from 1998 up to 2000 in terms of its sales relative to the other regions.\n\nMolina denied any liability for the car plan, claiming that he already settled the obligation when PPI demanded full payment as, in fact, all the papers related thereto, including the Release of Mortgage, were already in his possession.\n\nIn its Sur-Rejoinder, [48] PPI stressed its claim that Caritas was a business competitor, as may be inferred from the benefits available under its health care agreement and the pre-need contract of PPI.\u00a0 Particularly with regard to the pension plan contract, it noted the following similarities:\u00a0 (a) Caritas also provides Term Life Insurance, Accidental Death Insurance, Credit Life Insurance, and Waiver of Installment Due to Disability;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) there are similarities in the provisions on contract price, grace period, cancellation, reinstatement, and transfer and termination; and (c) unlike other health care programs that provide a one-year coverage, renewable every year thereafter, Caritas offers a continuous five year coverage and sells the same in units payable in five-year installment basis, with maturity period and guaranteed return of investment in the form of Full-Term Medical Expense Fund computed at P10,000.00 for every unit purchased with increment of 10% yearly after the maturity period, which may be withdrawn in cash by its member.\u00a0 It stressed that this was similar to the pension program offered by PPI which was also sold in per unit basis, payable by installment in certain number of years or lump sum payment, and upon maturity also gives P10,000.00 pension benefit per unit purchased by the plan holder. With respect to the alleged interest of Atty. Reyes with Caritas, PPI adduced in evidence a Deed of Sale to prove that as early as February 1999 he had already divested his stockholdings in Caritas. [49]\n\nOn November 18, 2002, Labor Arbiter Roma C. Asinas rendered a Decision [50] dismissing the complaint and the counterclaims for lack of merit.\u00a0 The labor arbiter ruled that Molina was lawfully dismissed from his employment for serious misconduct in office and fraud or willful breach of trust and confidence. It declared that Molina's mere denial of the charges against him did not overthrow the overwhelming evidence against him tending to show that he committed the allegations against him. Moreover, his wife was then an agency manager of Caritas, and some PPI sales associates were with Caritas because they were recruited by Molina. The labor arbiter also ruled that other employees of respondent attested to the fact that they were being recruited and enticed by the complainant to join Caritas. This act of pirating constituted serious misconduct in office, fraud or willful breach of trust and confidence, which are just causes for termination of employment under Article 282 of the Labor Code, as amended. As such, PPI could not legally be compelled to continue Molina's employment due to breach of trust.\n\nThe labor arbiter likewise held that Molina was afforded his right to due process, but that he refused to give an answer to the charges leveled against him, and instead insisted that he be furnished a copy of the alleged reports against him.\u00a0 Since he was given ample opportunity to answer the charges and explain his side during the investigation, and a formal or trial-type hearing is not at all times essential, Molina's right to due process was not violated. The labor arbiter stressed that the requirements of due process are satisfied where the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their side of the controversy at hand. [51]\n\nMolina appealed the decision to the NLRC, which rendered judgment in his favor.\u00a0 The NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and ordered Molina's immediate reinstatement to his former position as Assistant Vice President without demotion in rank and salary; and the payment of his backwages from August 1, 2001 up to his actual reinstatement, and other accrued monetary benefits. However, the NLRC denied all other claims for damages. [52]\n\nAccording to the NLRC, the charges of coming to the office under the influence of liquor and making PPI reimburse the expenses already paid by Molina's co-employees were not supported by the records. The \"loss of trust and confidence\" had no factual basis since the alleged acts of Molina did not result to any loss in favor of PPI.\n\nAnent Molina's recruitment activities, the NLRC ratiocinated that PPI failed to show that Caritas was a competitor of PPI. Caritas caters to the health care needs of its clients while PPI to the pre-need (pension, educational, and memorial) requirements of its plan holders.\u00a0 Any similarity between PPI and Caritas' extra features like term life insurance, accidental death insurance, credit life insurance, and waiver of installment due to disability, did not ipso facto make Caritas a competitor of PPI.\u00a0 Thus, there was no conflict of interest in Molina's act of trying to recruit counselors for Caritas to help his wife.\u00a0 Moreover, PPI failed to establish that recruiting for Caritas affected Molina's decisions in the performance of his duties with PPI.\u00a0 According to the NLRC, the drop in the sales and productivity of complainant's area of responsibility may be due to market forces and depressed economic condition at that time; absent any clear and convincing proof, it cannot be attributed to the alleged acts of Molina which constituted willful breach of trust or confidence. [53]\n\nPPI filed a motion for reconsideration, and appended a Letter dated June 13, 2002 from the SEC to Caritas, indicating that its HMO Plan was similar to the previous plans offered by pre-need companies, hence, under the regulatory suspension of the SEC; [54] another letter of SEC ordering Caritas to immediately desist from selling its HMO plan with the full term medial expense fund; [55] and the letter of Caritas, through counsel, endorsing the objectionable features of the HMO plan. [56]\n\nThe NLRC, however, was not persuaded, and resolved to deny PPI's motion in its Order dated September 30, 2003. [57] On November 19, 2003, the NLRC declared its Decision final and executory as of November 14, 2003. [58]\n\nPPI filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA for the nullification of the decision and resolution of the NLRC and the reinstatement of the decision of the Labor Arbiter. [59]\n\nOn August 13, 2004, the CA rendered a decision reversing the Decision and Resolution of the NLRC, and reinstating the November 18, 2002 Decision of the Labor Arbiter. [60] Later, the CA denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration [61] in its Resolution dated September 27, 2004. [62]\n\nThe issues for resolution are the following: whether the decision of the NLRC was already final and executory when PPI filed its petition for certiorari in the CA; and whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed decision and resolution.\n\nOn the first issue, we find and so hold that the decision of the NLRC had become final and executory when PPI filed its Petition for Certiorari in the CA.\u00a0 PPI received a copy of the NLRC Decision on July 11, 2003 and filed the Motion for Reconsideration thereof on July 18, 2003, which motion was denied on September 30, 2003.\u00a0 Under Rule VII, Section 2 of the NLRC Omnibus Rules of Procedure, the decision of the NLRC becomes final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the same.\u00a0 PPI received a copy of the NLRC decision on November 30, 2003; hence, such decision became final and executory on December 3, 2003.\u00a0 Nonetheless, the Court ruled in St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC [63] that, although the 10-day period for finality of the NLRC decision may have elapsed as contemplated in the last paragraph of Section 223 of the Labor Code, the CA may still take cognizance of and resolve a petition for certiorari for the nullification of the decision of the NLRC on jurisdictional and due process considerations.\u00a0 Indeed, the remedy of the aggrieved party from an adverse decision of the NLRC is to timely file a motion for reconsideration as a precondition for any further or subsequent remedy, and if the motion is denied, such party may file a special civil action in accordance with law and jurisprudence considering that these matters are inseparable in resolving the main issue of whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion.\n\nThe Labor Arbiter and the NLRC act in quasi-judicial capacity in resolving cases after hearing and on appeal, respectively. On the presumption that they have already acquired expertise in their jurisdiction, which is confined on specific matters, their findings of facts are oftentimes accorded not only with respect but even finality if supported by substantial evidence.\u00a0 However, in spite of the statutory provision making \"final\" the decision of the NLRC, the Court has taken cognizance of petitions challenging such decision where there is a clear showing that there is want of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, violation of due process, denial of substantial justice, or erroneous interpretation of law. [64]\n\nIn this case, the Labor Arbiter declared that there is substantial evidence on record warranting the dismissal of petitioner as Assistant Vice President for serious misconduct in office, fraud or willful breach of trust and confidence.\u00a0 The NLRC disagreed with the Labor Arbiter and reversed the latter's findings.\u00a0 The CA, for its part, concurred with the findings of the Labor Arbiter.\u00a0 In view of the discordance between the findings of the Labor Arbiter and the CA on one hand, and the NLRC on the other, there is a need for the Court to review the factual findings and the conclusions based on the said findings. As this Court held in Diamond Motors Corporation v. Court of Appeals : [65]\nA disharmony between the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission opens the door to a review thereof by this Court.\u00a0 Factual findings of administrative agencies are not infallible and will be set aside when they fail the test of arbitrariness.\u00a0 Moreover, when the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission contradict those of the labor arbiter, this Court, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, may look into the records of the case and reexamine the questioned findings. [66]\nArticle 282 of the Labor Code of the Philippines provides:\nArt. 282. Termination by employer.\u00a0 \u2014 An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:\nSerious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;\n\nGross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;\n\nFraud or willful breach by the employee of his duties of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;\n\nCommission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representative; and\n\nOther causes analogous to the foregoing.\nMisconduct has been defined as improper or wrong conduct; the transgression of some established and definite rule of action; a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, unlawful in character and implies wrongful intent and not mere error of judgment.\u00a0 The misconduct to be serious must be of such grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial and unimportant.\u00a0 Such misconduct, however, serious, must nevertheless, be in connection with the employee's work to constitute just cause for his separation. [67]\n\nThe loss of trust and confidence, in turn, must be based on the willful breach of the trust reposed in the employee by his employer. Ordinary breach will not suffice.\u00a0 A breach of trust is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly and purposely without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. [68]\n\nThe Court has laid down the guidelines for the application of the doctrine for loss of confidence, thus:\nthe loss of confidence must not be simulated;\n\nit should not be used as a subterfuge for causes which are illegal, improper or unjustified;\n\nit may not be arbitrarily asserted in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary;\n\nit must be genuine, not a mere afterthought, to justify earlier action taken in bad faith; and\n\nthe employee involved holds a position of trust and confidence. [69]\nIn Samson v. Court of Appeals , [70] the Court enumerated the conditions for one to be considered a managerial employee:\n(1) Their primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or subdivision thereof;\n\n(2) They customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more employees therein;\n\n(3) They have the authority to hire or fire other employees of lower rank; or their suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring and firing and as to the promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight. [71]\nAs a general rule, employers are allowed wide latitude of discretion in terminating the employment of managerial personnel. [72] The mere existence of a basis for believing that such employee has breached the trust and confidence of his employer would suffice for his dismissal. [73]\n\nIn this case, petitioner was not a mere employee of respondent.\u00a0 He was the Assistant Vice-President with the same functions of a regional manager of the same sales region, Metro Manila VI. \u00a0Taking into account his job description, he was one of the top managers of the respondent, tasked to perform key and sensitive functions in the interest of his employer and, thus, bound by the more exacting work ethic.\n\nWe find, however, that the charge of misappropriation of funds was not proven with substantial evidence. As gleaned from the handwritten statement of Ilustre Acosta, the General Manager of the Springs and Blessings General Agency under Metro Manila VI, it appears that, aside from him and petitioner, there were 10 other attendees during the luncheon conference on November 27, 1999 at the Barrio Fiesta, Cubao, Quezon City.\u00a0 Petitioner received the amount of only P2,386.00 from respondent to pay for the cost of the luncheon for the conference, based on\u00a0 Petty Cash Voucher signed by petitioner, [74] but the conferees spent more than P4,000.00.\u00a0 Upon petitioner's suggestion, the conferees agreed to contribute P200.00 each, or the total amount of P2000.00 to answer for the difference.\u00a0 Petitioner had no obligation to return the contributions of the conferees, nor was he liable for said amount. Significantly, except for Ilustre Acosta, the other attendees in the conference never complained against petitioner or requested him to return their respective contributions of P200.00.\n\nRegarding the charge that the petitioner peddled false and malicious informations against Abia and Padiernos, Abia has not executed any affidavit to confirm paragraph 9 of the affidavit of Roy Padiernos.\u00a0 As admitted by del Rosario, the informations allegedly relayed to her by the petitioner pertaining to Roy Padiernos were confirmed by Zita Domingo. [75]\n\nThe petitioner does not deny having had a heated exchange of words with Roy Padiernos in the course of a meeting.\u00a0 However, such incident does not constitute proof that the petitioner thereby showed disrespect to Roy Padiernos, nor a valid cause for petitioner's dismissal.\u00a0 It does happen that in the course of exchange of views during a meeting, participants may become so assertive to the point of being overbearing or unyielding and in the process lose their temper, on their sincere belief of being right. There is no evidence on record that petitioner committed the same or similar acts thereafter.\n\nTo prove its charge of conduct unbecoming of a company officer, more specifically of drinking alcoholic beverages within the premises of the company during office hours or going to work drunk, respondent relied on the statement/affidavit of Celeste Villena, the Agency Manager of the Wondrous and Miraculous General Agency under Metro Manila VI; [76] and\n\nMarivic Uy, the General Manager of the D'MBP General Agency under Metro Manila VI. Both claimed that they always saw petitioner drunk during office hours, most especially during cut-offs when many sales counselors were present. [77] Petitioner admitted having had drinking sessions with Certerio Uy, the husband of Marivic Uy, Ilustre Acosta and Reynaldo Villena, the husband of Celeste Villena, and who, according to petitioner, provided the hard liquor and the pulutan . [78] He, however, denied reporting to office drunk and insisted that he reported for work sober.\n\nWe are inclined to give credence to petitioner's claim, noting that in her handwritten letter-report to Norman Gonzales dated March 10, 2000, Villena made no mention of the petitioner going to office drunk. [79] It was only in her affidavit dated January 16, 2002 that Villena made such declaration. [80] Villena did not explain her failure to report the matter to Gonzales on March 10, 2000, and why she made the charge for the first time in her Affidavit dated January 16, 2002.\u00a0 Uy is the wife of no less than Certerio Uy, the Senior Vice-President of the Manila North Sales Division of respondent. If petitioner's \"drinking problem\" had any ring of truth, she should have immediately reported the matter to her husband or to other officials concerned. Uy's unexplained silence until March 10, 2000 thus renders her report implausible.\n\nRespondent avers that petitioner served directly as agent of Caritas, a business competitor of the respondent, when he connived with his wife in recruiting Sales Associates of the Metro Sales Division VI to transfer to Caritas as sales associates. Respondent claims that, by his acts, petitioner failed to dedicate his full time on the job with respondent and prevented said sales associates from doing the same. Aside from violating its policy against conflict of interest, petitioner's acts adversely affected his decisions in the performance of his duties and obligations to respondent. [81]\n\nLoyalty of an employee to his employer consists of certain very basic and common sense obligations.\u00a0 An employee must not, while employed, act contrary to the employer's interest. [82] The scope of the duty of loyalty that an employee owes to his employer may vary with the nature of their relationship.\u00a0 Employees occupying a position of trust and confidence owe a higher duty than those performing low-level tasks. Assisting an employee's competitor can even constitute a breach of the employee's duty of loyalty.\u00a0 An employee's self-dealing may breach that duty. [83] However, it has been ruled that\nA reality of contemporary life is that many families will consist of two wage earners, one wage earner with two jobs, or both. For some employees, particularly those earning low or modest incomes, second sources of income are an economic necessity. For them, a second job or \"moonlighting\" is the only way to make ends meet. Conversely, employers need the assurance that employees will not disserve them by furthering their own interests or those of competitors at the employers' expense. [84]\nA slight assistance to a direct competitor could constitute a breach of the employee's duty of loyalty.\u00a0 However, when competition is indirect or minimal, the employer may be required to show that the employee received substantial assistance from the competitor.\u00a0 If an employee usurped a corporate opportunity or secretly profited from a competitive activity, the employer may receive the value of the lost opportunity or the secret profit. [85]\n\nAn employee's skill, aptitude, and other subjective knowledge obtained in the course of employment are not the property of his employer. [86] However, an employee occupying a managerial position or office is obliged to protect the trade secret of his employer consisting of formula, process, device or compilation which it uses in its business and gives it an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know of such trade secret.\u00a0 However, the rule does not apply to a matter of public knowledge or of general knowledge within the industry. [87] Moreover, an employer has a protectible interest in the customer relationships of its former employee established and/or nurtured while employed by the employer, and is entitled to protect itself from the risk that a former employee might appropriate customers by taking unfair advantage of the contract developed while working for the employer. [88] While acting as an agent of his employer, an employee owes the duty of fidelity and loyalty. Being a fiduciary, he cannot act inconsistently with his agency or trust.\u00a0 He cannot solicit his employer's customers or co-employees for himself or for a business competitor of his employer.\u00a0 If such employee or officer connives with and induces another to betray his employer in favor of a business competitor of his employer, he is held accountable for his mischief. [89]\n\nIn this case, we are not persuaded that Caritas is the business competitor of respondent.\u00a0 The evidence on record shows that while Abia, the Senior Vice-President of respondent's Metro Manila Marketing, is one of the incorporators of Caritas and is even a member of the Board of Directors, respondent did not dismiss him from employment. The Head of the Legal Division of the respondent, Atty. Reyes, was also an incorporator of Caritas and a member of its Board of Directors, and although he appears to have sold his shares to Herminigildo C. Belen for P127,312.34, he only did so on March 7, 1999.\u00a0 There is no evidence on record whether the transfer of such shares of stocks has already been reflected in the books of Caritas.\u00a0 Celeste Villena, one of the Sales Associates of respondent, is herself licensed by Caritas to sell plans for the latter.\u00a0 Villena has likewise not been prohibited from selling pre-need plans for Caritas.\u00a0 Fe Molina, who is the head of a sales agency of Caritas, is also a sales agency head of respondent.\n\nPetitioner, his wife, and Villena were not charged nor meted any sanction by the respondent for conflict of interest. Petitioner was the Assistant Vice-President, Marketing Head, Area 10, of Caritas, and for a while, without any protest from respondent. If Caritas is a business competitor of the respondent, it should have meted sanctions not only on petitioner but also on Abia, Reyes, Fe Molina and Villena as well.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that, as averred by Caritas President Geoffrey Martinez, Caritas is engaged in health care and hospitalization package, whereas respondent sells educational, pension, and pre-need plans.\u00a0 Caritas is an HMO and is directly supervised by the DOH, while respondent is under the supervision of the SEC. The so-called sales associates of the respondent are non-salaried employees and are paid on commission basis only.\u00a0 Their commissions are based on their individual initiative and industry. That the contracts executed by the beneficiaries of both corporations have similar provisions regarding contract price, grace period, cancellation, reinstatement, transfer and termination, do not constitute proof that Caritas and respondent are business competitors.\u00a0 There is also no proof that the two corporations compete with each other in the same or similar business; in fact, the business of Caritas and that of the respondent complement each other.\n\nRespondent relied on the declarations of Ruth Padiernos, Spouses Eppie and Ilustre Acosta, Celeste Villena, and Marivic Uy to prove its charge that Fe Molina pirated sales associates working for respondent and that petitioner tolerated the actuations of his wife and even connived with her.\n\nThe Court finds, however, that the evidence adduced by respondent insufficient to warrant the petitioner's dismissal from employment.\n\nRuth Padiernos, wife of Roy Padiernos, averred in her written statement dated March 8, 2000, that as far back as July 1999, she had a conference with her husband and Abia where she reported that petitioner connived with his wife in pirating sales associates. She was assured that something would be done to arrest the problem. [90] However, Ruth Padiernos failed to name any such sales associate who was recruited by Fe Molina.\u00a0 There is likewise no evidence that Abia ever confronted petitioner relative to the charge.\u00a0 Roy Padiernos confronted petitioner, but the latter denied the charge.\u00a0 Since then, no further action was taken against the petitioner by respondent, until the letter of Picazo dated March 21, 2000 was sent to him.\u00a0 Roy Padiernos did not explain why he executed his affidavit regarding the matter almost three years later, only on January 18, 2002. In an Affidavit dated January 18, 2002, it was made to appear that Ruth Padiernos claimed that petitioner's wife, the Unit Manager of the Ark Group under Metro Manila Sales Group VI and also an Agency Manager of Caritas, recruited sales associates under respondent to work for Caritas, and that petitioner did the same; and that she (Padiernos) learned that almost all the productive Sales Associates in Metro Manila VI were already connected with Caritas, using \"different names.\" [91] Although notarized, the affidavit has no probative weight because it was unsigned .\n\nCeleste Villena, for her part, declared in her handwritten statement dated March 10, 2000 that Fe Molina recruited Lenie Gatmaitan to join Caritas and that she confronted petitioner. [92] In her Affidavit dated January 16, 2002, she alleged that petitioner and his wife, Fe Molina, recruited Gatmaitan to join Caritas. [93] However, the signature of the notary public does not appear in said affidavit.\u00a0 For his part, Ilustre Acosta, averred in his handwritten statement dated March 11, 2000, that on March 4, 2000, petitioner informed him that Geoffrey Martinez called petitioner to inquire if petitioner would have no objection for him (Ilustre) to be with Caritas and that petitioner replied that he had no objection if that was Ilustre's decision. [94] Ilustre maintained this claim in his Affidavit dated January 16, 2002. [95] Eppie Acosta, the wife of Ilustre Acosta, averred in her handwritten statement of March 12, 2000, that on March 6, 2000, petitioner commented about their low sales production, and she retorted that he was the cause, hence, may have grudges against him.\u00a0 Petitioner replied that he and his wife did not interfere with each other's business dealings, and that petitioner even declared \"Mare, for all you know , ikaw na lang ang hindi nag-ca-Caritas.\" She reiterated her claim in her affidavit dated January 16, 2000. [96] Marivic Uy averred that the wife of petitioner had been pirating sales associates of respondent since 1999 to join Caritas and that she tried to recruit Morena Siasoco, one of the Group Managers.\u00a0 Petitioner failed to stop his wife, but rather tolerated her actuations. [97] She reiterated her claim in her Affidavit dated January 16, 2002. [98]\n\nHowever, there is no evidence on record to prove that respondent expressly prohibited its Sales Associates from selling for Caritas.\u00a0 Neither is there evidence on record to prove that Caritas prohibited its sales associates from selling pre-need plans of respondent.\n\nRespondent likewise failed to present the affidavits of Siasoco, Casaje, Magalso, San Miguel and Halili.\u00a0 In contrast to the evidence of respondent, Gatchalian, San Miguel, Siasoco, and Gatmaitan executed their respective affidavits declaring that neither petitioner nor his wife ever recruited them. [99] They admitted that they sold plans for Caritas, but without any prodding from petitioner and his wife. Geoffrey Martinez declared, in his affidavit, that Siasoco, San Miguel, Casaje, Magalso, and Halili joined Caritas voluntarily and individually, through him, and he was not aware that petitioner and his wife recommended them to Caritas.\u00a0 Lenita Gatmaitan called him and inquired if she could join Caritas, and he replied in the affirmative.\u00a0 He never called petitioner concerning Ilustre Acosta; on the contrary, it was the latter who called to inquire if he was entitled to a discount if he purchased a Caritas health plan. He talked to Vilma Del Rosario and convinced her to apply as Branch Manager of Caritas, which she did, but backed out later on.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. The August 13, 2004 Decision and September 27, 2004 Resolution of the Court of Appeals are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The decision and resolution of the NLRC are reinstated.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez, and Chico-Nazario, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Delilah Vidallon-Magtolis, with Associate Justices Eliezer R.

CV No. 71990 , reinstating private respondents\u2019 appeal in said case despite previous dismissal thereof by the same court, and even as an entry of judgment had already been made thereon. The prohibition aspect of the petition seeks to enjoin the CA from further proceeding with said case.\n\nThe material facts:\n\nOn February 5, 2001, in the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, herein private respondents who are heirs of one Soterania Si\u00f1el, filed, through their counsel, Atty. Florencio D. Gonzales, a complaint [3] for Annulment of Documents, Real Estate Mortgages, Promissory Notes, Annulment of Foreclosure Proceedings, Accounting and Damages against the herein corporate petitioners and the Provincial Sheriff of Aklan. Docketed in the same court as Civil Case No. 6247 and raffled to Branch VI thereof, the complaint substantially alleged that the real estate mortgages and promissory notes therein mentioned executed by respondents\u2019 predecessor-in-interest in favor of petitioner Moneytrend Lending Corporation (Moneytrend) and the deeds of assignments executed by the latter in favor of co-petitioner Mercantile Credit Resources Corporation (Mercantile) as well as the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings conducted by the Provincial Sheriff\u00a0 of Aklan which evidently resulted in the sale of the mortgaged properties to co-petitioner RMJ Agro-Industrial Development Corporation (RMJ) were all null and void for lack of consideration.\n\nIn time, petitioner Mercantile, followed later by petitioners Moneytrend and RMJ filed their respective motions to dismiss on the common ground of litis pendentia. The motions uniformly alleged that about two (2) years earlier, or on April 16, 1999, some of the respondents, as plaintiffs, had already filed against petitioners a similar complaint for annulment of the same real estate mortgages, which complaint, docketed in the same court as Civil Case No. 5735, was dismissed by Branch V thereof and presently on appeal with the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 66559.\n\nIn an Order [4] dated June 27, 2001, the trial court granted petitioners\u2019 motions to dismiss and accordingly dismissed Civil Case No. 6247 , \u00a0ratiocinating as follows:\nThere is no dispute that on April 16, 1999, herein plaintiff Antonio G. Si\u00f1el, Jr., filed before the Regional Trial Court, 6th Judicial Region, Branch 5, Kalibo, Aklan, Civil Case No. 5735, entitled \u2018Antonio G. Si\u00f1el vs. Viola S. Cahilig and Moneytrend Lending Corporation\u2019. The case is for annulment and/or declaration of nullity of real estate mortgage and damages. It is now pending appeal before the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 66559.\n\nDefendant Viola S. Cahilig in Civil Case No. 5735 is the same Viola S. Cahilig as one of the herein Plaintiffs while herein defendant Moneytrend Lending Corporation is the same defendant Moneytrend Lending Corporation in Civil Case No. 5735. defendant Mercantile Credit Resources Corporation which is not one of the defendants in Civil Case No. 5735 is admittedly a successor-in-interest of defendant Moneytrend Lending Corporation. Other plaintiffs in the present case are successors-in-interest of Soterania Si\u00f1el, one of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 5735. Hence, according to movants, there is an identity of the parties in the instant case with that of the parties in Civil Case No. 5735. The identity of parties need not be absolute but merely substantial (Anticamora vs. Ong, 82 SCRA 337,342).\n\nIn their opposition to the motion filed by defendants Moneytrend Corporation and RMJ Ago-Industrial Development Corporation, plaintiffs, however, did not seriously dispute the identity of parties in Civil Case No. 5735 with the present case. Plaintiffs simply pointed out that the present complaint involves six (6) causes of action while Civil Case No. 5735 is only for Annulment of Real Estate Mortgage and Damages.\n\nWhile the present complaint mentions six (6) causes of action, yet the prayer only seeks for the annulment of the Real Estate Mortgage and the foreclosure proceedings as well as damages. This is the same relief being sought by the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 5735.\n\nIt is therefore clear that there is another action (Civil Case No. 5735, now pending in the Honorable Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 66559, entitled \u2018Antonio G. Si\u00f1el, Jr., etc. vs. Viola S. Macahilig and Moneytrend Lending Corp.\u2019) for the same cause of action.\nAgainst said order of dismissal, respondents, as plaintiffs below, filed with the trial court a Notice of Appeal, [5] therein making known their intention to appeal to the CA the dismissal order. Consequently, the records of Civil Case No. 6247 were elevated to the CA whereat respondents\u2019 appellate recourse was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 71990.\n\nIn time, the CA issued a notice [6] to file brief,\u00a0 requiring respondents, as appellants, to file their Appellants\u2019 Brief within forty-five days from notice. It is not disputed that, respondents\u2019 counsel, Atty. Florencio Gonzales, received his copy of the notice on January 29, 2002, which means that respondents had only up to March 16, 2002 within which to file their Appellants\u2019 Brief.\n\nThe 45-day period came and went but no appellants\u2019 brief was ever filed. Neither did Atty. Gonzales file any motion for extension of time therefor.\n\nHence, in a Resolution [7] dated July 9, 2002, the CA deemed respondents\u2019 appeal as having been abandoned and accordingly dismissed the same, to wit:\nFor failure of counsel for appellants [respondents] to file appellants\u2019 brief, the appeal is hereby deemed ABANDONED and DISMISSED , pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nAgain, it is a matter of record that respondents\u2019 counsel, Atty. Gonzales, received copy of said dismissal resolution on July 17, 2002. [8] And neither is it disputed that counsel never filed any motion for reconsideration of the same dismissal resolution.\n\nAccordingly, with said resolution having become final and executory, the CA caused to be made an Entry of Judgment [9] in CA-G.R. CV No. 6247 on August 2, 2002.\n\nThen, on January 20, 2003, or more than six (6) months after Entry of Judgment, Atty. Cesar Verano filed his Entry of Appearance [10] as respondents\u2019 new counsel. And simultaneously therewith, Atty. Verano filed in CA-G.R. CV No. 71990 the following pleadings, all dated January 20, 2003, to wit:\nMOTION TO ADMIT HEREIN ATTACHED MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE RESOLUTION DATED JULY 9, 2002; [11]\n\nMOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION (OF RESOLUTION DATED JULY 9, 2002); [12] and}\n\nMOTION TO ADMIT HEREIN ATTACHED BRIEF FOR PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS [13] (with the appellants\u2019 brief [14] thereto attached).\nTo the foregoing motions, petitioners filed their\u00a0 comment/opposition. [15]\n\nAfter a further exchange of pleadings by the parties, the CA came out with the herein assailed Resolution [16] dated August 12, 2003, setting aside its dismissal resolution of July 9, 2002 and admitting respondents\u2019 Appellants\u2019 Brief. Partly says the CA in its challenged resolution:\nIn the interest of justice and equity, the appellants [respondents] may not be made to bear the unfavorable effect of the gross negligence of their counsel, and lose their right to be heard.\u00a0 The right to counsel proceeds from the fundamental principle of due process which basically means that a person must be heard.\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\nIt is on the basis of these pronouncements of the Supreme Court that equity should be applied. What is sought to be applied in the absence of the law is the pervading principle of equity and justice above strict legalism.\u00a0 Strict application of the Rules cannot work to prejudice the right of the appellants [respondents]. (Words in brackets supplied).\nWith their motion for reconsideration having been denied by the CA in its equally challenged resolution [17] of October 8, 2004, petitioners have come to this Court via \u00a0the present recourse\u00a0 on the following grounds:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN GIVING DUE COURSE TO RESPONDENTS\u2019 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION FILED SIX (6) MONTHS AFTER SAID COURT HAD ALREADY DISMISSED CA G.R. CV. NO.71990, FOR FAILURE OF THE RESPONDENTS TO FILE THEIR APPELLANTS\u2019 BRIEF AND AFTER THE COURT OF APPEALS HAD ALREADY MADE AN ENTRYOF JUDGMENT IN SAID CASE.\n\nCONSIDERING THE ADMISSION OF PRIVATE RESPONDENTS THROUGH ATTY. CEASAR T. VERANO THAT THE FAILURE OF THEIR FORMER COUNSEL, ATTY. FLORENCIO D. GONZALES, TO FILE THEIR APPELLANTS\u2019 BRIEF ON TIME, \u201cWAS SOLELY DUE TO THE\u00a0 GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF APPELLANT\u2019S (sic) FORMER COUNSEL, WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF HEREIN PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS (private respondents in this case) \u201d, THE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN REINSTATING PRIVATE RESPONDENTS\u2019 APPEAL, CONTRARY TO THE WELL-ENSCONSED RULE THAT THE PARTIES ARE BOUND BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THEIR COUNSEL.\nThe petition is impressed with merit.\n\nIn the disposition of judicial controversies, reasonable and justifiable liberality in the application of procedural rules should be the guiding principle, where otherwise substantial justice would be jeopardized. Inadequacies and errors of form should be overlooked when they would defeat rather than help the judge in arriving at a just and fair result as to the essential merits of any case. This is not to say, however, that the rules fixing periods within which certain acts must be done either by the parties or by the court come within the realm of liberality in adjective law. Public interest demands that there be limits of time in the procedure laid down for the administration of justice. Otherwise, through inadvertence, negligence or indolence, not to speak of malice, suits may be unduly prolonged, thereby giving veracity to that lamentable situation of justice delayed, justice denied. In other words, when it comes to compliance with time rules, the Court cannot afford unexcusable delay. [18]\n\nIt may be that mere lapse of the period to file an appellant\u2019s brief does not automatically result in the dismissal of the appeal and loss of jurisdiction by the appellate court. It ought to be stressed, however, the relaxation of the rules on pleadings and practice to relieve a party-litigant of an injustice must be for most persuasive reasons. [19] And in case of delay, the lapse must be for a reasonable period.\u00a0 The element of reasonableness does not obtain in the present case.\u00a0 The 45-day period within which private respondents were supposed to file their brief expired on March 16, 2002. This notwithstanding, no attempt was made to move for extension on or before that date.\u00a0 Then, too, on July 14, 2002, when Atty. Florencio Gonzales received the July 9, 2002 Resolution of the CA dismissing private respondents\u2019 appeal for his failure to file his clients\u2019 brief,\u00a0 no motion for reconsideration was filed within fifteen (15) days from his receipt of such notice of dismissal explaining his failure to file the required brief.\n\nYet, despite the lapse of six (6) months from the finality of its Resolution of Dismissal of July 9, 2002, and even as Entry of Judgment had already been made in the case, the CA proceeded to reinstate private respondents\u2019 appeal purportedly \u201c in the interest of substantial justice. \u201d \u00a0Considering the period involved, the CA\u2019s act of reinstating a belated appeal amounts to grave abuse of discretion. The Court can allow that the power or discretion to reinstate an appeal that had been dismissed is included in or implied from the power or discretion to dismiss an appeal.\u00a0 Nonetheless, such power or discretion must be exercised upon showing of good and sufficient cause, in like manner as the power or discretion vested in the appellate court to allow extensions of time for the filing of briefs.\n\nIn a long line of decisions, the Court has repeatedly held that, while the rules of procedure are liberally construed, the provisions on reglementary periods are strictly applied, indispensable as they are to the prevention of needless delays and are necessary to the orderly and speedy discharge of judicial business. The same is true with respect to the rules on the manner and periods for perfecting appeals. [20] It bears stressing that the timely perfection of an appeal is a mandatory requirement not to be trifled with as a \u201cmere technicality\u201d to suit the interest of a party. The rules on periods for filing appeals are to be observed religiously, and parties who seek to avail themselves of the privilege must comply with the rules. [21] The failure to perfect an appeal as required by law renders the judgment final, immutable\u00a0 and executory. [22]\n\nIn their motion to admit their brief, respondents emphasized therein that their failure to timely file the same was due to the gross negligence of their former counsel who neither informed them of the necessity therefor nor of his failure to do so, even as the adverse resolution dated July 9, 2002 deemed their appeal as abandoned and thus dismissed. It cannot be over-emphasized that the client is, as a rule, bound by his counsel\u2019s negligence and mistakes in handling the case. A client who suffers prejudice by reason of his counsel\u2019s inexcusable negligence in the discharge of his duty may, however, file an action for damages against him. He may also institute a disbarment proceeding. Both actions can proceed independently of the other. [23]\n\nHere, the CA\u2019s Resolution of Dismissal had indisputably become final. Well-settled is the rule that a judgment which has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and, hence, may no longer be set aside, modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of law or fact. The fundamental policy is that all litigations must, at some time, come to an end, however unjust the result of error may appear. [24] Otherwise, litigation would become more intolerable than the wrong or injustice it is designed to correct. [25] And since the CA had already lost jurisdiction over CA-G.R. CV No. 71990 when the finality of its dismissal resolution of July 9, 2002, had set in, not to mention that an entry of judgment had already been made thereon, that court cannot justify the reinstatement of private respondents\u2019 appeal by invoking its equity jurisdiction.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the assailed CA resolutions dated August 12, 2003 and October 8, 2004 in CA G.R. CV No. 71990 are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE and its resolution of July 9, 2002 dismissing the appeal in said case is REINSTATED . A writ of prohibition is thus issued enjoining the CA from taking further action thereon, except to remand the records to the court of origin.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nPuno, (Chairman) and Azcuna, JJ. , concur.\nCorona, J. , on leave.\nSandoval-Gutierrez, J., on sick leave.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice S.

IGONIA, CASHIER I, OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, SAN PEDRO, LAGUNA, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is an administrative complaint filed by Raul H. Sesbre\u00f1o (\"complainant\") against Lorna O. Igonia (\"respondent\"), Cashier I, former officer-in-charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna. Complainant charged respondent with dishonesty, grave misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, violation of Article 213, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, violation of Sec. 3 paragraph (e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (\"RA 3019\"), [1] and violation of Republic Act No. 6713 (\"RA 6713\"). [2]\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna rendered a judgment in favor of complainant in a civil case for ejectment against the spouses Licerio and Belen de Borja (\"de Borja spouses\"). [3] Pursuant to the judgment, a Notice to Vacate and Writ of Execution was served on the de Borja spouses in October 2001. Complainant admitted that he \"assisted in serving the Court processes involved.\" This prompted the de Borja spouses to file a complaint against him for \"threats\" before the Barangay Lupon of San Vicente, San Pedro, Laguna. [4]\n\nOn 9 January 2002, Punong Barangay Norvic D. Solidum (\"Solidum\") summoned complainant to appear before the Lupon for conciliation proceedings. Complainant disregarded the summons and instead wrote a letter to Solidum saying he did not attend because \"the implementation of the writ of execution and notice to vacate cannot be considered a threat\" and \"there is nothing to be subject of amicable settlement since the matters involved were already resolved in final and executory court judgments.\" [5]\n\nSolidum sent a second letter dated 10 January 2002 to complainant, ordering him to comply with the summons and to appear on the scheduled hearing on 15 January 2002. Otherwise, Solidum declared he would be constrained to file the necessary charges of Indirect Contempt of Court against complainant. [6]\n\nOn 1 February 2002, Solidum filed a Petition for Indirect Contempt of Court (\"petition\") in the Municipal Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna where respondent was designated officer-in-charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court. Solidum's petition alleges that complainant failed to appear \"without any justifiable reason\" at the mediation hearing before the Barangay Lupon. [ 7] Although a petition for contempt, the pleading is captioned \"People of the Philippines v. Atty. Raul H. Sesbre\u00f1o.\" The petition was docketed as Criminal Case No. 38504. It was later raffled to Branch 1 of the Municipal Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna (\"MTC\").\n\nThe Clerk of Court of Branch 1, Ruben Albaytar (\"Albaytar\"), inquired from the Office of the Clerk of Court on the correctness of the classification of Criminal Case No. 38504. In her letter-reply, respondent explained:\nPlease take notice that the pleading in itself is a pleading for a criminal complaint, hence, it was docketed a criminal case number.\n\nIn your inquiry however, may I refer you to the Rules of Court x x x where Contempt of Court x x x is classified as a Special Civil Action.\n\nWe may be in a dilemna (sic), because the title is for a criminal complaint and the gist of the petition itself is for Contempt of Court under Rule 71, which is for a special civil action, and perhaps, it is now up to the court to issue an order regarding to this (sic), and order the amendment, if necessity requires and an orderly proceedings (sic) mandates. [8] On 15 April 2002, complainant filed a motion in Criminal Case No. 38504 seeking to have respondent declared in contempt of court. [9] Complainant cited as grounds respondent's act of docketing the petition as a criminal complaint and her failure to collect the docket fee. Complainant argued that respondent erred in receiving the petition since it was not verified and not accompanied by certified true copies of supporting documents, as required by the Rules of Court.\n\nBefore the trial court could resolve the motion, complainant filed this administrative complaint against respondent before the Office of the Court Administrator (\"OCA\") on 17 April 2002, raising essentially the same arguments as those in the motion. Complainant alleges that respondent exhibited dishonesty when she \"deliberately, willfully and with criminal intent to cheat or defraud the government of the fees due it, refused and failed to collect the full docket and other legal fees from Mr. Solidum, thru the scheme of docketing Mr. Solidum's complaint for indirect contempt as a criminal case.\" [10]\n\nOn the charge of gross ignorance of the law, complainant cited respondent's acceptance of the petition \"despite the fact that it is not verified x x x and the documents attached to it are not certified true copies, in gross violation of [par. 2], Sec. 4, Rule 71 x x x.\" [11]\n\nOn the charge of violation of Article 213 of the Revised Penal Code, [12] complainant asserted that the \"unjustified and irregular act of respondent Igonia constitutes the making 'use of any other scheme to defraud the government\" as this phrase is used in par. 1, Art. 213, Revised Penal Code on 'frauds against the public treasury and similar offenses'.\" [13]\n\nOn the charge of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, complainant accused respondent of giving Solidum \"unwarranted benefits or advantage\" as a result of which \"the government is also unnecessarily injured and damaged for the fees due it which were not collected.\" [14]\n\nFinally, complainant accused respondent of violating RA 6713, [15] claiming that \"the act of respondent x x x shows that she failed to discharge her duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence and justice, making her liable under Sec. 2, in relation with Sec. 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.\" [16]\n\nIn her letter [17] dated 23 May 2002, respondent adopted as her Comment in the administrative case, her Comment [18] (\"Comment\") dated 29 April 2002 filed in the MTC. In her Comment, respondent admitted that she assigned Solidum's petition a criminal case number solely because of its title. However, respondent denied knowing at the time of docketing that the petition was a special civil action, \"for the allegations in the complaint (petition) were examined when Mr. Albaytar wrote the letter of inquiry dated February 4, 2002 x x x.\" [19]\n\nRespondent further made the following assertions: (1) that if there was an error in the docketing of the case, it was up to the trial court to issue the appropriate order for correction; (2) that the function of her office is only to docket complaints; (3) that she should not be held liable because what she committed was \"perhaps, an inadvertence or an honest mistake;\" (4) that regarding \"compliance with the requirements of the Rules of Court as to the filing of initiatory pleadings,\" the trial court may just issue an order of dismissal or require the parties to comply with the Rules of Court; and (5) that \"we are performing our assigned tasks and functions to the best of our knowledge and ability in the Office of the Clerk of Court, and errors or omissions that may have been committed anent the filing of complaints are not deliberate x x x.\" [20]\n\nThe OCA's Findings\n\nIn its Report (\"Report\") dated 22 January 2004, the OCA found that \"respondent did not give even a modicum of attention to what was filed and immediately concluded that [the petition] was a criminal complaint because it was initiated in the name of the People of the Philippines x x x.\" [21] Thus, the OCA recommended that respondent be reprimanded for slight (or simple) neglect of duty. The OCA based its recommendation on the following facts:\nRespondent Lorna O. Igonia has been in the service for almost twenty (20) years. She was appointed as Cashier 1 of MTC-OCC, San Pedro, Laguna on November 5, 1984. Her personal file shows that she was twice designated as OIC-Clerk of Court of the same court. The first was on January 12, 1999 until February 17, 1999, the second was on September 12, 1999 which was revoked on April 16, 2002. Respondent's long years of service, coupled with her stint as OIC-Clerk of Court must have given her enough exposure to familiarize herself with the nature of the works in the OCC x x x. [22] On 8 March 2004, this Court issued a resolution re-docketing the case as a regular administrative matter.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nWe agree with the findings and recommendation of the OCA.\n\nIndisputably, the pleading filed by Solidum is a petition for indirect contempt although its caption pertains to a criminal case. Solidum should have filed his petition in accordance with Section 4, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, thus:\nSEC. 4. How proceedings commenced. \u2013 Proceedings for indirect contempt may be initiated motu proprio by the court against which the contempt was committed by an order or any other formal charge requiring the respondent to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt.\n\nIn all other cases, charges for indirect contempt shall be commenced by a verified petition with supporting particulars and certified true copies of documents or papers involved therein, and upon full compliance with the requirements for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the court concerned x x x. (Emphasis supplied) A charge of indirect contempt must be filed in the form of a verified petition if it is not initiated directly by the court against which the contemptuous act was committed. We clarified on previous occasions [23] that such petition is by a special civil action. Certified true copies of related documents must be submitted with the petition and appropriate docket fees must be paid. The requirement of a verified petition is mandatory. As Justice Florenz D. Regalado [24] has explained:\nThis new provision clarifies with a regulatory norm the proper procedure for commencing contempt proceedings. While such proceeding has been classified as a special civil action under the former Rules, the heterogeneous practice, tolerated by the courts, has been for any party to file a mere motion without paying any docket or lawful fees therefor and without complying with the requirements for initiatory pleadings, which is now required in the second paragraph of [Section 4].\n\nx x x x On Respondent's Administrative Liability\n\nRespondent claims that she docketed the petition for contempt as a criminal case because of the petition's caption. Paragraph 7 of respondent's Comment also states that \"no docket fees were collected when the instant case was filed, this because of the fact that it was docketed as a criminal case and is not a money claim (as in Estafa and Violation of B.P. 22).\" [25]\n\nRespondent's explanation fails on at least two counts. First, just one inch below the caption appears the title, \"Petition for Indirect Contempt of Court,\" written in bigger font size, underlined, and in bold capital letters, thus:\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES\n- versus -\nATTY. RAUL H. SESBRE\u00d1O,\n# 4 Ninth St., Cor. Pacita Ave.\nPhase 3, Pacita Complex I,\nSan Pedro, Laguna,\nRespondent,\nx--------------------------------------x\n\nPETITION FOR INDIRECT CONTEMPT OF COURT\n\nx x x x [26]\n\nIf respondent made even a cursory reading of the petition, she would have known immediately that it was for indirect contempt. The petition prays that \"the respondent, Atty. Raul H. Sesbre\u00f1o, be cited for indirect contempt of court.\" [27] More importantly, the allegation of facts in the body of the pleading imputes a contemptuous act [28] because complainant supposedly \"failed to appear during the mediation hearing of the case without any justifiable reason which as a result (sic) the administration of justice was jeopardized.\" [29]\n\nWe have consistently ruled that it is not the caption but the allegations in the complaint or other initiatory pleading which give meaning to the pleading, and on the basis of such allegations, the pleading may be legally characterized. [30] In other words, to determine the nature of a pleading, one must not rely on its caption or title, but on the contents or allegations of the body of the pleading.\n\nSecond, even granting that the petition involved a criminal case, respondent should still have read the pleading \u2014 or more particularly the criminal complaint \u2014 in order to know the crime charged against the \"accused.\" Under Section 20 of Rule 141, complaints charging certain crimes such as estafa and violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 require the payment of fees upon filing. [31]\n\nRespondent seems to have gone through the motions of receiving and docketing the pleading almost mechanically, basing her acts upon a mere glance at the caption. Given her experience of serving as clerk of court for more than two years, she should have known the procedure for the filing of criminal and civil cases, including special civil actions. If she were not conversant with petitions for indirect contempt, then the prudent solution would have been to refer to Rule 71 on contempt proceedings.\n\nAs clerk of court, respondent performs administrative functions that are vital to the prompt and sound administration of justice. [32] She is tasked, among others, with receiving cases for docketing and assessing filing fees. [33] True, her duty on the filing of pleadings is confined merely to their receipt and docketing. On the other hand, she should discharge such responsibility with thoroughness and utmost prudence. The administration of justice is a sacred task. It demands the highest degree of efficiency, dedication and professionalism. [34] Respondent displayed an obvious lack of care and attention in the performance of her duty. She failed to observe the high standards expected of an officer of the court, for which she must be held administratively liable.\n\nNonetheless, the record does not support complainant's charges of grave misconduct, dishonesty and gross ignorance of the law. To constitute gross ignorance of the law, the acts complained of must not only be contrary to existing law and jurisprudence but must also be motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty and corruption. [35] For serious or grave misconduct to exist, there must be substantial evidence showing that the acts complained of were corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law or were in persistent disregard of well-known legal rules. [36] It does not appear to the Court that the actuations of respondent were motivated by any of these. To our mind, the errors committed by respondent were not deliberate but arose out of negligence and sheer carelessness.\n\nIt is elementary in law that bad faith is not presumed and he who alleges the same has the onus of proving it. [37] Complainant's evidence does not suffice to meet the burden.\n\nOn the charge of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, there is not enough evidence to hold respondent administratively liable.\n\nWe have repeatedly emphasized the heavy burden and responsibility which court officials and employees must observe, in view of their positions as sentinels in the administration of justice. They must constantly act beyond reproach, always mindful that any misbehavior, whether true or only perceived, could cast doubt on the integrity of the courts. [38]\n\nOn the Appropriate Penalty to be Imposed\n\nThe Court agrees with the recommendation of the OCA that respondent is administratively liable for simple neglect of duty, defined as the failure to give proper attention to a task expected of an employee resulting from either carelessness or indifference. [39] Considering that this is respondent's first infraction and on the belief that she acted in good faith, in view of the fact that the petition for indirect contempt against complainant was dismissed by the trial court in an Order dated 14 October 2002, [40] we accept the recommended penalty of reprimand.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court finds respondent Lorna O. Igonia, Cashier I of the Metropolitan Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna, guilty of simple neglect of duty. The Court REPRIMANDS her, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar infraction shall merit a more severe sanction.\n\nLet a copy of this decision be attached to the personnel records of Lorna O. Igonia.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales, and Tinga, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Otherwise known as the \"Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.\" Sec. 3(e) of this law provides:\n\nSec. 3.

MAXIMA LENSICO, RUFINA LENSICO, ROGELIO LENSICO AND VICTOR LENSICO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nIn denying this Petition, the Court relies on a well-established doctrine. Thus, subject to some exceptions that do not apply here, the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals affirming those of the trial court cannot be disturbed, modified or reversed by this Court in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n\nThe Case\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review [1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 30, 2003 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 46045. The dispositive part of the assailed Decision disposed as follows:\n\"WHEREFORE, except for the award of attorney's fees and costs of suit which are hereby DELETED , the appealed decision is otherwise AFFIRMED .\" [3]\nThe Facts\n\nThe facts of the case are narrated by the CA as follows:\n\"x x x. This land was originally a part of the Friar Land known as Lot No. 2833, Fls-644 of the Naic Estate, containing an area of 16,459 square meters, and was registered on February 4, 1913 under Act No. 496 and issued Original Certificate of Title No. 181. Its then occupant of 34 years, the now deceased Melanio Lensico, on September 8, 1964 filed an Application to Purchase Friar Lands. An investigation was conducted by Land Investigator Dominador Bayot who found the information contained in the application to be true, and recommended that the lot be sold at private sale without auction in favor of Melanio Lensico, and gave its appraised value. After drawing three (3) favorable endorsements, said recommendation was approved. Whereupon Sales Contract No. V-270 was executed between the Bureau of Lands as the vendor and Melanio Lensico married to Donata Mojica as the vendees who paid the purchase price in full. This sale was acknowledged on August 8, 1968 by the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources with Deed No. V-1-0193. Eventually, Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-78832 was issued on September 8, 1975 in the names of Melanio Lensico and Donata Mojica.\n\n\"Out of the 16,459 square meters total area of the property, Cavite College occupies a portion of some 11,650. Their squabble began after the death of the registered owners, their children and heirs namely the litigants Maxima, Rufina, Rogelio and Victor, surnamed Lensico, required the payment of rentals for the occupancy of the area. Their demands having been ignored, the Lensicos required Cavite College compensation for occupancy and to either vacate or buy the premises. The Republic of the Philippines on the other hand made moves to cancel the issued Transfer Certificate of Title. Their disagreements resulted in the filing of Civil Case No. NC-934 and Civil Case No. NC-963.\n\n\" Civil Case No. NC-934 is a suit styled to be for Recovery of Possession of Property or Payment of Price of Land filed by the Lensicos against Cavite College. They alleged that they are the legitimate children of the registered owners; that it was only after the death of their parents when they learned that Cavite College has been occupying a portion of the lot sans payment of rentals; that apart from verbal demands they also sent three (3) letters to Cavite College but to no avail.\n\n\"Cavite College admitted the existence of TCT T-78332 but insisted that by its actual occupation since 1961 and the immense improvements it had introduced, it has a better and superior right to the property. Cavite College traced its right of possession on the following occurrences: that Congress on June 18, 1960 enacted Republic Act [2] 661 which was AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SCHOOL OF FISHERIES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF NAIC, PROVINCE OF CAVITE; that pursuant to this, the Naic Municipal Council on August 6, 1961 passed a resolution designated as KAPASIYAHANG IPINAGKAKALOOB SA CAVITE SCHOOL OF FISHERIES ANG MGA SANGAB (FORESHORE LAND) SIMULA SA NGAYON MGA BAGONG KARSADA (BOUNDARY) HANGGANG SA NAYON NG BUCANA, PARA MAGAMIT SA KANILANG PAGTUTURO. That after this, Cavite College started to construct its school buildings without objection from the Lensicos or their parents. It averred that the property in question was mostly an area reclaimed from the sea by the construction of rock groins. Although Cavite College admitted that the property was covered by a title, it argued that its issuance to the registered owners is null and void because the lot is actually a part of the foreshore land which is a public domain. The sales application of the registered owners was only on 1964 whereas Cavite College had been occupying the area since 1961. And that the Information Sheet for the sales application did not disclose the true improvements on the property because despite the buildings that Cavite College have constructed thereon and which occupies the greater area, what was reflected as improvements are only the following: \"one house of strong materials, 1 small nipa hut, 6 coconut trees, and 1 tamarind tree, valued P500.00\" Cavite College stressed that with its continued possession and introduction of valuable improvements thereon, it should be given a superior right to the property because had it not been for the rock groins it constructed, then the whole property which faces Manila Bay would have been lost to the sea.\n\n\" Civil Case No. NC-963 , on the other hand, is a suit for Annulment of Title and Reversion of Land to the State filed by the Republic of the Philippines against the Lensicos and the Register of Deeds for the Province of Cavite. Through this action, the Republic of the Philippines sought the cancellation of TCT No. T-78832 which it claims to be null and void, and that the Lensicos have no vested rights whatsoever on the property which is part of the foreshore land and could not be titled as private property. According to the Republic of the Philippines, the particulars given by Melanio Lensico in the Application to Purchase Friar Lands and the Information Sheet were false, and so also was the recommendation submitted by Land Investigator Dominador Bayot in the Information Sheet because it did not declare as one of the improvements in the property the school buildings and other developments introduced by Cavite College. That were it not for these false informations, then there would have been no sale between the Bureau of Lands and Melanio Lensico. In trying to invalidate the issuance of the TCT, it was argued by the Republic of the Philippines that the Bureau of Lands or the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had no jurisdiction or authority to award or sell the said property because this has already been designated by Republic Act 2661 on June 18, 1960 as a site for the establishment of the school of Cavite College.\n\n\"The Lensicos countered that it was not true that the Cavite College had erected a building on the property as early as 1961 because in 1964 there was as yet no building in the area. To controvert further, they stated that when Congress approved Republic Act 2661 and the Naic Municipal Council passed its Resolution on August 5, 1961 designating the foreshore land as the school site, the exact location was not yet determined and it was only later when it was discovered that the Cavite College already encroached on their property that the subject area was imputed. It was also denied that the property was part of the sea because this had long been dry land and part of the Naic Estate known as Lot No. 2833, Fls-644 and among its boundaries are Lot Nos. 733 and 2834.\n\n\"These two cases were consolidated, and on July 5, 1993, the court a quo rendered its judgment, the decretal portion of which reads:\n\"WHEREFORE, this Court passes judgment ordering the defendant in Civil Case No. NC-934 to pay plaintiffs the price of P25.00 per square meter of the portion of Lot 2833 with an area of 11,650 square meters, or, to pay reasonable rent at the rate of P2,000.00 per month from the time defendant occupied said premises until December 1999, unless the plaintiffs agreed for an extended period of 30 years thereafter. Should the defendant fail to comply to the foregoing terms and conditions, it shall vacate the said area occupied within three (3) months from finality of this Decision, and, to pay the rents thereof at the reasonable rate of P2,000.00 per month from July 1961. Since there appears no evidence regarding attorney's fees, the defendant is hereby Ordered to pay plaintiffs reasonable sum of attorney's fees of P20,000.00 plus costs of suit.'\" [4] Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that the subject lot was formerly a friar land and not a part of the public domain. The CA added that the evidence of respondents was not sufficiently overcome by that presented by petitioners to establish the claim that the property was foreshore or beach land. [5] It further said that the public nature of the land was dispelled by its registration since February 4, 1913 under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) 181. [6]\n\nThe court a quo also debunked petitioners' claim that Melanio Lensico's Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) T-78832 had been fraudulently obtained. According to the CA, the TCT was granted upon full compliance with the substantive and procedural requirements for its acquisition, such as the appraisal and investigation by the Bureau of Lands (BL), as well as several endorsements from BL officers. The appellate court further reasoned that respondents had an indefeasible and conclusive title to the property, by virtue of which the Municipal Council of Naic had no authority to dispose of any part of the land. [7]\n\nFinally, while affirming the trial court's Order for petitioners either to purchase the property or to pay corresponding rentals, the CA nonetheless set aside the award for attorney's fees for lack of basis. [8]\n\nHence, this Petition. [9]\nThe Issue\n\nPetitioners raise this sole issue for our consideration:\n\"Whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing petitioners' appeal on the ground that the subject property is not part of foreshore land and that respondents' predecessor-in-interest did not commit fraud in securing a certificate of title over the subject property.\" [10]\nOtherwise stated, the issue is whether respondents' predecessor was the lawful owner of the parcel of land occupied by petitioner school.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Petition has no merit.\n\nSole Issue:\nOwnership of the Subject Premises\n\nPetitioners argue that respondents did not have a valid title to the property, because TCT T-78832 was null and void. They contend that Lot 2833, the area covered by the title, is foreshore and beach land and, thus, a piece of public property. [11] Consequently, it may not be alienated or registered, notwithstanding the alleged possession of it by Melanio Lensico for a substantial length of time. [12] They present the Information Sheet he prepared and two Survey Plans, all describing the property as beach land. That it was mostly so was allegedly revealed, too, by the trial court's ocular inspection. [13]\n\nTo further bolster their position, petitioners allege that it was previously not in existence, because it did not appear in the June 6, 1911 map of the Naic Friar Estate, although it did in the March 25, 1930 survey, which described it as beach land. They also submit pictures taken by a geodetic engineer of the Bureau of Lands during the relocation survey, illustrating that two corners of the lot adjoined the Manila Bay. [14] Thus, they conclude that the property is foreshore land.\n\nForeshore or Friar Lands\n\nOn the basis of all these arguments, petitioners ask this Court to set aside the trial and the appellate courts' factual finding that the subject property was not foreshore land.\n\nIt must be stressed that only questions of law may be raised in petitions to review decisions of the Court of Appeals filed before this Court. [15] The factual findings of the CA affirming those of the trial court are final and conclusive. They cannot be reviewed by this Court, save only in the following circumstances, which we find absent in the instant case: (1) when the factual conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; (2) when the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case in making its findings, which are further contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the CA's findings are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the conclusions do not cite the specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) when the CA's finding's of fact, supposedly premised on the absence of evidence, is contradicted by the evidence on record. [16]\n\nPetitioners have failed to establish that the present case falls under any of the exceptions enumerated above. A perusal of the facts and evidence presented does not convince this Court to deviate from the findings of fact of the courts a quo . The lower courts properly appreciated the evidence submitted by both parties as regards the nature of the property. These courts have determined that the lot was part of the friar lands that had been titled since 1913; it was not foreshore land.\n\nForeshore land has been defined as that which lies between the high and the low water marks, and that is alternately wet and dry according to the flow of the tide. [17] In other words, it is that strip of land between high and low water, the land left dry by the flux and reflux of the tides. [18]\n\nIn the present case, although corners 3 and 4 of Lot 2833 have been shown to adjoin [19] the sea, they -- let alone the entire Lot 2833 -- have not been proven to be covered by water during high tide. Hence, the property cannot be considered foreshore land.\n\nFraud in Title Application\n\nPetitioners submit that because TCT No. T-78832 was fraudulently acquired, the principle of indefeasibility of title does not attach to it. They allege that Melanio Lensico was merely a dummy. Supposedly because he was illiterate, someone else completed the application without verifying from the former the correctness of the entries made. [20] In that application, the latter allegedly misrepresented Lensico as the actual occupant of the property at the time. Petitioners, as testified to by their witnesses as well as Rogelio Lensico, had purportedly constructed several buildings in the area before the application was filed. [21] The alleged misrepresentation is cited as a sufficient ground to nullify the TCT. [22]\n\nTo illustrate an alleged pattern of fraud, petitioners maintain that the application was granted without actual investigation, which no government employee could have conducted on Saturday and Sunday, the days between September 18, 1964, when the application was submitted; and September 21, 1964, when the Information Sheet, stating that an investigation had been conducted, was completed. They further contend that the elder Lensico's description of the lot and the improvements on it were blindly and wholly copied in the Information Sheet. [23]\n\nFinally, Melanio Lensico purportedly failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of notice (to the municipal president) and publication, as laid down in Sections 9 and 11 of Act 1120, which governs the disposition of friar lands. [24] Petitioners point out that neither the school nor the elders in the area were aware of the application.\n\nWhether fraud attended the application for the title is a factual question that revolves purely upon a proper appreciation of the evidence. For the same reasons stated previously, the findings of the lower courts that petitioners failed to adduce evidence sufficient to establish that fraud had attended the issuance of the title to Lensico cannot be overturned.\n\nTo prove the existence of fraud, petitioners rely on mere allegations unsupported by sufficient evidence. There is no showing that, although illiterate, Lensico was not informed of the contents of the document he was privy to. Neither is there any evidence to show the absence of an actual investigation of the property. Petitioners' allegation that government employees do not work on weekends, when pitted against the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed, [25] falls short of the required preponderance of evidence.\n\nPetitioners maintain that Lensico misrepresented himself as the actual occupant of the property at the time of his application to purchase the land. They insist that respondents could not have been occupying it, because Petitioner Cavite College of Fisheries had already constructed buildings on 11,650 square meters of it, supposedly since 1961.\n\nAssuming arguendo that the contention of petitioners is true, the existence of those buildings at the time does not preclude the fact that Lensico could have indeed been the actual occupant of Lot 2833 -- at least, of 4,809 square meters of it. Hence, their mere assertion that they constructed buildings on a portion of the lot does not preclude the possibility that someone else could have occupied the other portions of it, and that the latter had been in possession of the entire property prior to their entry. It is worth pointing out that the College was granted the foreshore land to be used in teaching. [26] However, it ended up occupying the property, which was not foreshore but titled land, specifically a portion of Lot 2833.\n\nAll told, we find no compelling reason to disturb the factual findings of the two lower courts. Petitioners have failed to prove that, in his application to purchase Lot 2833, Melanio Lensico willfully and knowingly made any false statement that would sufficiently cause the cancellation of the application and the forfeiture (in favor of the government) of all amounts paid on the land. The validity of TCT T-78322, as well as its issuance to respondents' predecessor, stands.\n\nThe predecessor of respondents paid the government for the purchase of the entire 16,459 square meters comprising Lot 2833. Therefore, it would be just and correct that they be compensated for Petitioner Cavite College of Fisheries' use of the portion that belongs to the Lensicos.\n\nBasis for the Purchase Price\n\nPetitioners theorize that the purchase price of the land should be based on its value at the time it was taken, considering that the occupied portion consists mainly of areas reclaimed through the efforts and resources of the government. As the College is a public entity that promotes public welfare, it avers that its interests prevail over respondents' private interests. [27]\n\nIn expropriation proceedings, the value of the land and its character at the time it was taken by the government are the criteria for determining just compensation. [28] As noted in Ansaldo v. Tantuico , [29] there are instances when, as in the present case, the expropriating agency takes over the property prior to the expropriation suit, in which situation just compensation shall be determined as of the time of taking. Commissioner of Public Highways v. Burgos [30] held that the price of the land when it was taken, not its value after the passage of time, represents the true value to be paid as just compensation. Hence, the value of the property upon its actual taking, subject of course to interest accruing from that time, should be the basis of the purchase price if Petitioner Cavite College of Fisheries opts to buy the property.\n\nIn the present case, the trial court has already determined that the just compensation for the taking of the subject portion of respondents' land is the selling price of P25 per square meter or rent of P2,000 per month. The justness of this determination, which was affirmed by the CA, is not seriously assailed by petitioners. Again, we find no compelling reason to disturb this finding, as it is factual in nature.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED , and the assailed Decision AFFIRMED.

      "title": "of the very first case he filed with the Court, UDK-12854, entitled Ramon Sollegue vs. Court of Appeals, et al. Frustrated with the adverse ruling thereon, Atty. Sorreda had previously written a letter[3] dated April 2, 2001 addressed to the Chief Justice, copy furnished all the Associate Justices of this Court, the Court of Appeals and the Office of the Solicitor General, denouncing the Court, as follows:Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the manner the Court comported itself in the aforesaid case is totally execrable and atrocious, entirely unworthy of the majesty and office of the highest tribunal of the land. It is the action not of men of reason or those who believe in the rule of law, but rather of bullies and tyrants from whom \"might is right.\" I say, shame on the High Court, for shoving down a hapless suitor's throat a ruling which, from all appearances, it could not justify.Reacting to the above, the Court, in an en banc Resolution dated August 14, 2001,[4] required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be properly disciplined \"for degrading, insulting and dishonoring the Supreme Court by using vile, offensive, intemperate and contemptuous derogatory language against it\".In response to the \"show cause\" order, Atty. Sorreda addressed two (2) more letters to the Court dated December 2, 2001[5] and June 16, 2002,[6] arguing for the propriety of his action and practically lecturing the Court on his concepts of Legal and Judicial Ethics and Constitutional Law. In its Resolutions of January 15, 2002[7] and August 27, 2002[8], the Court merely noted said two letters.Quoted from his earlier communications are the following statements of Atty. Sorreda disparaging the Court with intemperate, insulting, offensive and derogatory language, to wit:\"SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE SERIOUSLY AND TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY'S JUSTICE SYSTEM\"[9]\"WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE?xxx xxx xxxI therefore deplore and condemn in the strongest term such strong-handed actuations as the Honorable Court has displayed. They are as one might expect in a dictatorship or authoritarian regime.\"[10]Persistent in imputing to the Court and its Justices offensive and uncalled remarks, Atty. Sorreda again went on a rampage in his subject letter of February 21, 2005:xxx xxx xxxMr. Chief Justice, I do not doubt that these ten cases are among the most palpably meritorious cases that have ever been brought before the Supreme Court, or any court of justice for that matter. I cannot doubt that were it not for the Sollegue \"miscounting,\" and the other incidents that ensued from it, at least some of these ten cases would have met with entirely different endings, so obvious and patent are their merits to any reasonable and impartial mind.In short, Mr. Chief Justice, it is obvious that the High Court has taken it personally against me. To the detriment of my innocent clients. And of justice.Mr. Chief Justice, why should this be? If the Court had anything against me, I stood ready to have the ax fall on my own neck, if it came to that. As I had stated in one communication-[I]f there is one thing I agree with in the High Court's position, it is that x x x if indeed I had wronged the Court in the way it had described, and if indeed my explanations and arguments \"lack merit,\" I should indeed be disciplined; and surely no less than DISBARMENT will do. It should also be done as swiftly as possible, given the gravity of the charge and the high dignity and importance of the institution attacked. Now on January 22, 2002 and May 7, 2002, the Court has resolved to deny to the undersigned the \"full opportunity\" for self-defense that he request ... therefore he is now left without any defense, and he can only wonder why no sanction has come down until the present time.Might it be because I had continued, \"Of course, I shall also only expect that such judgment, when it does come, will be a fully-reasoned one, as thoroughly discussed perhaps as that in In re Almacen, 31 SCRA 562, for the proper guidance of all concerned\"- and the Court knows that it is not able to give such a \"fully-reasoned judgment\" as I ask? But rather than admit it has done wrong and rectify the same, it would rather \"get back\" at me by means of unfavorable rulings in the cases I elevate to it- let the innocent litigants, whose only mistake was to hire me as their counsel, and the cause of justice suffer as they may.Mr. Chief Justice, that is not only unjust; that is craven cowardice, to deal with an adversary like that. It is not something I would have expected from the supreme judges of the land.I can only view other happenings in the Honorable Court in such light. The same verifications that were previously unfaulted, suddenly became course for dismissal. What other interpretation can I give it, than that the court had run out of excuses to dismiss, since I was being careful not to repeat the same adjudged \"shortcomings\"; and was now scrounging every which way for one, just so to make sure I continue to get my \"comeuppance.\"That of the first nine cases, not one was assigned to the Third Division- only either to the Second Division, then chaired by Justice Josue N. Bellosillo, which handled the Sollegue case; or the First Division, chaired by the Chief Justice, to whom I have directly written afterwards. Could it be only a coincidence - or is it a more likely explanation that the powers-that-be in the Court wanted to be very sure I never get favorable ruling? Especially when it is considered that, following Justice Bellosillo's retirement on November 12, 2003, for the first time in the history of the nation's judiciary a vacancy in the Supreme Court was filled up way beyond the constitutionally prescribed period of 90 days- and after so much mystery and intrigue has surrounded the appointment of his successor, Justice Minita V. Chico-Nazario. In fact Justice Nazario was sworn in on July 14, 2004, just one day before a new retirement took place, this time of Justice Jose C. Vitug. It was only following this latest retirement, that for the first time this counsel had a case assigned to other than the First and Second Division. Could it be that Justice Vitug, then Chairman of the Third Division, and Justice Nazario, erstwhile presiding Justice of the Sandiganbayan, had redoubtable reputations for independent-mindedness; and the powers-that-be in the court exercised their utmost influence to at least prevent the both of them sitting in the bench at the same time, lest together they should \"buck the system\" and divide the Court, if not successfully sway the Court to favorably rule on the undersigned counsel's cases before it?xxx xxx xxxBut this time, in these ten cases I have recounted, I am wholly convinced that the court is in the wrong. I cannot but thus be filled with both acute sadness and burning indignation. Sadness as counsel, to come to the realization that the high institution of which I am an officer has sunk to such a low. Indignation as a citizen, that the public officers who are supposed to serve him and help him find justice, should instead give judgments that so insult the intelligence and glare with iniquity.Mr. Chief Justice, whatever gave the Court the notion that it could pronounce 29 days as greater than 60 days, and not to have to account for it? Who can believe that the supposedly most illustrious legal minds of the land, would miss seeing grave abuse of discretion in the actions of an agency that directly contravened numerous laws and rules all at once? How could democracy's vaunted \"last bulwark\" suffer a widow and her children to thereafter live in their toilet, by sanctioning the plainly void sale and illegal demolition of their erstwhile family home? Did the court pause for even three minutes to put itself in the shoes of an evidently innocent man kept locked up for three years now on a manifestly false and fabricated charge, before it so blandly invoked its \"discretion\" not to entertain his appeal at all? Where did the Court get such brazenness, such shameless boldness, as to dismiss on the ground that the docket fees had not been paid, when the evidence clearly show they in fact were? What manner of men are you- even challenging the citizenry to inform on the corrupt, and the bar to become like \"Frodo\" in the fight against society's evils in your public speeches and writings, and yet you yourselves committing the same evils when hidden from public view. Are all these rulings in the ten cases not the clearest manifestation that the supreme magistrates have bought into the \"What-are-we-in-power-for\" mentality? (Underscoring ours)Upon instructions of the Chief Justice, Atty. Sorreda's aforesaid letter of 21 February 2005 was included in the March 15, 2005 en banc agenda of the Court.In an en banc Resolution[11] dated March 15, 2005, the Court again required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for maliciously attacking the Court and its Justices.By way of compliance to the second \"show cause\" order, Atty Sorreda, in his letter of May 10, 2005[12], again with copies thereof furnished the Justices, judges and lawyers thereunder listed, states that he \"does not see the need to say any more\" because the \"cause\" has \"already been shown as clear as day\" in his earlier letter of 21 February 2005, adding that \"[T]he need is for the High Tribunal to act on the instant matter swiftly and decisively\". While admitting \"the great seriousness of the statements and imputations I have leveled against the Court\", he dared the Court whether \"it is capable of a judgment that will be upheld by the 'Supreme Judge'\".After going over the records of the cases in which Atty. Sorreda accuses the Court of being unfair in the resolution thereof, the Court stands by its rulings thereon. Atty. Sorreda mockingly stated that the Court does not know how to count when it dismissed the Sollegue case on ground of failure to file the petition therein within the reglementary period. For the enlightenment of the good counsel, the Court dismissed the petition in Sollegue not only for failure to have it filed within the period fixed in Sec. 4, Rule 65 but also for failure to submit the duplicate original or certified true copy of the questioned resolution of the Court of Appeals dated June 28, 1999 in accordance with Sec. 1, Rule 65 and Sec. 3, Rule 46, in relation to Sec. 2, Rule 56.[13] In another case, Ronilo Sorreda vs. CA, Atty. Sorreda claimed that said case was dismissed on the mere ground of insufficient verification. Again, Atty. Sorreda must be reminded that the petition was dismissed not merely for defective verification but more so because the petition was evidently used as a substitute for a lost remedy of appeal.[14] We see no need to belabor the grounds for the dismissal of the other cases enumerated by counsel, said grounds having been stated in the respective minute resolutions which were plain, clear, simply worded and understandable to everyone, even to those who do not have a formal education in law. Suffice it to say that the dismissal of those petitions was the result of a thorough deliberation among members of this Court.Atty. Sorreda's imputation of manipulation in the assignment and raffle of cases is utterly baseless and at best a mere figment of his imagination.Unfounded accusations or allegations or words tending to embarrass the court or to bring it into disrepute have no place in a pleading. Their employment serves no useful purpose. On the contrary, they constitute direct contempt of court or contempt in facie curiae and a violation of the lawyer's oath and a transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility.In Ang vs. Castro[15], this Court held that if a pleading containing derogatory, offensive and malicious statements is submitted in the same court or judge in which the proceedings are pending, it is direct contempt, equivalent as it is to a misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the administration of justice. Direct contempt is punishable summarily.[16]Atty Sorreda's conduct likewise violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically -CANON 11 - A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others.x x xRule 11.03 - A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the courts.Rule 11.04 - A lawyer shall not attribute to a judge motives not supported by the record or having no materiality to the case.While a lawyer owes absolute fidelity to the cause of his client, full devotion to his client's genuine interest and warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his client's rights, as well as the exertion of his utmost learning and ability,[17] he must do so only within the bounds of the law.[18] A lawyer is entitled to voice his criticism within the context of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech which must be exercised responsibly. After all, every right carries with it the corresponding obligation. Freedom is not freedom from responsibility, but freedom with responsibility. The lawyer's fidelity to his client must not be pursued at the expense of truth and orderly administration of justice. It must be done within the confines of reason and common sense.[19]Atty. Sorreda, as a citizen and as an officer of the court, is entitled to criticize the rulings of this Court, to point out where he feels the Court may have lapsed with error. But, certainly, this does not give him the unbridled license to insult and malign the Court and bring it into disrepute. Against such an assault, the Court is duty-bound \"to act to preserve its honor and dignity and to safeguard the morals and ethics of the legal profession\".[20]The eloquent words of the late Justice Conrado V. Sanchez in Rheem of the Philippines vs. Ferrer[21] are enlightening:By now, a lawyer's duties to the Court have become commonplace. Really, there could hardly be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof. Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, in categorical terms, spells out one such duty: \"To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.\" As explicit is the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that \"[i]t is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.\" That same canon, as a corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to support the courts against \"unjust criticism and clamor.\" And more. The attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a conduct that should be \"with all good fidelity xxx to the courts.\" Worth remembering is that the duty of an attorney to the courts \"can only be maintained by rendering no service involving any disrespect to the judicial office which he is bound to uphold.\"In Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel,[22] Justice Sanchez further elucidated:A lawyer is an officer of the courts; he is, \"like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.\" His duty is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts to which he owes fidelity, \"not to promote distrust in the administration of justice.\" Faith in the courts a lawyer should seek to preserve. For, to undermine the judicial edifice \"is disastrous to the continuity of government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people.\" Thus has it been said of a lawyer that \"[a]s an officer of the court, it is his sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice.\"Likewise, in Zaldivar vs. Gonzales,[23] we held:Respondent Gonzales is entitled to the constitutional guarantee of free speech. No one seeks to deny him that right, least of all this Court. What respondent seems unaware of is that freedom of speech and of expression, like all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute and that freedom of expression needs an occasion to be adjusted to and accommodated with the requirement of equally important public interests. One of these fundamental public interests is the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the administration of justice. There is no antimony between free expression and the integrity of the system of administering justice. For the protection and maintenance of freedom of expression itself can be secured only within the context of a functioning and orderly system of dispensing justice, with the context, in other words, of viable independent institutions for delivery of justice which are accepted by the general community.As officer of the court, Atty. Sorreda has the duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts and to promote confidence in the fair administration of justice.[24] No less must this be and with greater reasons in the case of the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, as the last bulwark of justice and democracyAtty. Sorreda must be reminded that his first duty is not to his client but to the administration of justice, to which his client's success is wholly subordinate. His conduct ought to and must always be scrupulously observant of law and ethics. The use of intemperate language and unkind ascription can hardly be justified nor can it have a place in the dignity of judicial forum. Civility among members of the legal profession is a treasured tradition that must at no time be lost to it.[25]Here, Atty. Sorreda has transcended the permissible bounds of fair comment and constructive criticism to the detriment of the orderly administration of justice. Free expression, after all, must not be used as a vehicle to satisfy one's irrational obsession to demean, ridicule, degrade and even destroy this Court and its magistrates.[26]We have constantly reminded that any gross misconduct of a lawyer, whether in his professional or private capacity, puts his moral character in serious doubt as a member of the Bar, and renders him unfit to continue in the practice of law.[27]In the very recent similar case of Tacardon, et al vs. Ponce Enrile,[28] we imposed on the respondent therein the penalty of suspension from the Bar. Here, as in Tacardon, we find the exclusion of Atty. Sorreda from the Bar a fitting sanction until he proves himself worthy to enjoy the privileges of membership to the profession. It is imperative to instill in him sense of discipline that should teach him anew of his duty to respect courts of justice, especially this Tribunal. This rehabilitation must be done outside the brotherhood he has dishonored and to which he will be allowed to return only after he has purged himself of his misdeeds.[29]WHEREFORE, ATTY. NOEL S. SORREDA is found guilty both of contempt of court and violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility amounting to gross misconduct as an officer of the court and member of the Bar. He is hereby indefinitely SUSPENDED as a member of the Bar and is prohibited from engaging in the practice of law until otherwise ordered by this Court.Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished the Court Administrator to be distributed to all courts for their information.

SORREDA.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nIn a letter [1] to the Chief Justice bearing date February 21, 2005, with copies thereof furnished all the Associate Justices of the Court and other government entities, RTC judges and counsels listed thereunder, Atty. Noel S. Sorreda, who identified himself as \"member, Philippine Bar\", expressed his frustrations over the unfavorable outcome of and the manner by which the Court resolved the following cases filed by him, to wit:\nUDK-12854, Ramon Sollegue vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,\nG.R. No. 149334, Artemio Dalsen vs. Commission on Elections\nG.R. No. 148440, Lilia Sanchez vs. Court of Appeals\nG.R. No. 152766, Lilia Sanchez vs. Court of Appeals, et al.\nG.R.

Alba-Estoesta, et al.\nIn said letter, Atty. Sorreda recounted the alleged circumstances surrounding the dismissal on February 7, 2000 [2] of the very first case he filed with the Court, UDK-12854 , entitled Ramon Sollegue vs. Court of Appeals, et al. Frustrated with the adverse ruling thereon, Atty. Sorreda had previously written a letter [3] dated April 2, 2001 addressed to the Chief Justice, copy furnished all the Associate Justices of this Court, the Court of Appeals and the Office of the Solicitor General, denouncing the Court, as follows:\nMr. Chief Justice, I believe the manner the Court comported itself in the aforesaid case is totally execrable and atrocious, entirely unworthy of the majesty and office of the highest tribunal of the land.\u00a0 It is the action not of men of reason or those who believe in the rule of law, but rather of bullies and tyrants from whom \"might is right.\" I say, shame on the High Court, for shoving down a hapless suitor's throat a ruling which, from all appearances, it could not justify .\nReacting to the above, the Court, in an en banc Resolution dated August 14, 2001, [4] required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be properly disciplined \"for degrading, insulting and dishonoring the Supreme Court by using vile, offensive, intemperate and contemptuous derogatory language against it\".\n\nIn response to the \"show cause\" order, Atty. Sorreda addressed two (2) more letters to the Court dated December 2, 2001 [5] and June 16, 2002, [6] arguing for the propriety of his action and practically lecturing the Court on his concepts of Legal and Judicial Ethics and Constitutional Law.\u00a0 In its Resolutions of January 15, 2002 [7] and August 27, 2002 [8] , the Court merely noted said two letters.\n\nQuoted from his earlier communications are the following statements of Atty. Sorreda disparaging the Court with intemperate, insulting, offensive and derogatory language, to wit:\n\"SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE SERIOUSLY AND TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY'S JUSTICE SYSTEM\" [9]\n\n\"WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE?\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\nI therefore deplore and condemn in the strongest term such strong-handed actuations as the Honorable Court has displayed.\u00a0 They are as one might expect in a dictatorship or authoritarian regime.\" [10]\nPersistent in imputing to the Court and its Justices offensive and uncalled remarks, Atty. Sorreda again went on a rampage in his subject letter of February 21, 2005:\nxxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\nMr. Chief Justice, I do not doubt that these ten cases are among the most palpably meritorious cases that have ever been brought before the Supreme Court, or any court of justice for that matter. I cannot doubt that were it not for the Sollegue \"miscounting,\" and the other incidents that ensued from it, at least some of these ten cases would have met with entirely different endings, so obvious and patent are their merits to any reasonable and impartial mind.\n\nIn short, Mr. Chief Justice, it is obvious that the High Court has taken it personally against me.\u00a0 To the detriment of my innocent clients.\u00a0 And of justice.\n\nMr. Chief Justice, why should this be? If the Court had anything against me, I stood ready to have the ax fall on my own neck, if it came to that.\u00a0 As I had stated in one communication-\n[I]f there is one thing I agree with in the High Court's position, it is that x x x if indeed I had wronged the Court in the way it had described, and if indeed my explanations and arguments \"lack merit,\" I should indeed be disciplined; and surely no less than DISBARMENT will do. It should also be done as swiftly as possible, given the gravity of the charge and the high dignity and importance of the institution attacked. Now on January 22, 2002 and May 7, 2002, the Court has resolved to deny to the undersigned the \"full opportunity\" for self-defense that he request ... therefore he is now left without any defense, and he can only wonder why no sanction has come down until the present time.\nMight it be because I had continued, \"Of course, I shall also only expect that such judgment, when it does come, will be a fully-reasoned one, as thoroughly discussed perhaps as that in In re Almacen , 31 SCRA 562, for the proper guidance of all concerned\"- and the Court knows that it is not able to give such a \"fully-reasoned judgment\" as I ask? But rather than admit it has done wrong and rectify the same, it would rather \"get back\" at me by means of unfavorable rulings in the cases I elevate to it- let the innocent litigants, whose only mistake was to hire me as their counsel, and the cause of justice suffer as they may.\n\nMr. Chief Justice, that is not only unjust; that is craven cowardice, to deal with an adversary like that. It is not something I would have expected from the supreme judges of the land.\n\nI can only view other happenings in the Honorable Court in such light. The same verifications that were previously unfaulted, suddenly became course for dismissal. What other interpretation can I give it, than that the court had run out of excuses to dismiss, since I was being careful not to repeat the same adjudged \"shortcomings\"; and was now scrounging every which way for one, just so to make sure I continue to get my \"comeuppance.\"\n\nThat of the first nine cases, not one was assigned to the Third Division- only either to the Second Division, then chaired by Justice Josue N. Bellosillo, which handled the Sollegue case; or the First Division, chaired by the Chief Justice, to whom I have directly written afterwards.\u00a0 Could it be only a coincidence - or is it a more likely explanation that the powers-that-be in the Court wanted to be very sure I never get favorable ruling?\u00a0 Especially when it is considered that, following Justice Bellosillo's retirement on November 12, 2003, for the first time in the history of the nation's judiciary a vacancy in the Supreme Court was filled up way beyond the constitutionally prescribed period of 90 days- and after so much mystery and intrigue has surrounded the appointment of his successor, Justice Minita V. Chico-Nazario.\u00a0 In fact Justice Nazario was sworn in on July 14, 2004, just one day before a new retirement took place, this time of Justice Jose C. Vitug. It was only following this latest retirement, that for the first time this counsel had a case assigned to other than the First and Second Division. Could it be that Justice Vitug, then Chairman of the Third Division, and Justice Nazario, erstwhile presiding Justice of the Sandiganbayan, had redoubtable reputations for independent-mindedness; and the powers-that-be in the court exercised their utmost influence to at least prevent the both of them sitting in the bench at the same time, lest together they should \"buck the system\" and divide the Court, if not successfully sway the Court to favorably rule on the undersigned counsel's cases before it?\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx\n\nBut this time, in these ten cases I have recounted, I am wholly convinced that the court is in the wrong. I cannot but thus be filled with both acute sadness and burning indignation. Sadness as counsel, to come to the realization that the high institution of which I am an officer has sunk to such a low. Indignation as a citizen, that the public officers who are supposed to serve him and help him find justice, should instead give judgments that so insult the intelligence and glare with iniquity .\n\nMr. Chief Justice, whatever gave the Court the notion that it could pronounce 29 days as greater than 60 days, and not to have to account for it?\u00a0 Who can believe that the supposedly most illustrious legal minds of the land, would miss seeing grave abuse of discretion in the actions of an agency that directly contravened numerous laws and rules all at once?\u00a0 How could democracy's vaunted \"last bulwark\" suffer a widow and her children to thereafter live in their toilet, by sanctioning the plainly void sale and illegal demolition of their erstwhile family home? Did the court pause for even three minutes to put itself in the shoes of an evidently innocent man kept locked up for three years now on a manifestly false and fabricated charge, before it so blandly invoked its \"discretion\" not to entertain his appeal at all? Where did the Court get such brazenness, such shameless boldness, as to dismiss on the ground that the docket fees had not been paid, when the evidence clearly show they in fact were? What manner of men are you- even challenging the citizenry to inform on the corrupt, and the bar to become like \"Frodo\" in the fight against society's evils in your public speeches and writings, and yet you yourselves committing the same evils when hidden from public view.\u00a0 Are all these rulings in the ten cases not the clearest manifestation that the supreme magistrates have bought into the \"What-are-we-in-power-for\" mentality ? (Underscoring ours)\nUpon instructions of the Chief Justice, Atty. Sorreda's aforesaid letter of 21 February 2005 was included in the March 15, 2005 en banc agenda of the Court.\n\nIn an en banc Resolution [11] dated March 15, 2005, the Court again required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for maliciously attacking the Court and its Justices.\n\nBy way of compliance to the second \"show cause\" order, Atty Sorreda, in his letter of May 10, 2005 [12] , again with copies thereof furnished the Justices, judges and lawyers thereunder listed, states that he \"does not see the need to say any more\" because the \"cause\" has \"already been shown as clear as day\" in his earlier letter of 21 February 2005, adding that \"[T]he need is for the High Tribunal to act on the instant matter swiftly and decisively\".\u00a0 While admitting \"the great seriousness of the statements and imputations I have leveled against the Court\", he dared the Court whether \"it is capable of a judgment that will be upheld by the 'Supreme Judge'\".\n\nAfter going over the records of the cases in which Atty. Sorreda accuses the Court of being unfair in the resolution thereof, the Court stands by its rulings thereon.\u00a0 Atty. Sorreda mockingly stated that the Court does not know how to count when it dismissed the Sollegue case on ground of failure to file the petition therein within the reglementary period.\u00a0 For the enlightenment of the good counsel, the Court dismissed the petition in Sollegue not only for failure to have it filed within the period fixed in Sec. 4, Rule 65 but also for failure to submit the duplicate original or certified true copy of the questioned resolution of the Court of Appeals dated June 28, 1999 in accordance with Sec. 1, Rule 65 and Sec. 3, Rule 46, in relation to Sec. 2, Rule 56. [13] In another case, Ronilo Sorreda vs. CA , Atty. Sorreda claimed that said case was dismissed on the mere ground of insufficient verification.\u00a0 Again, Atty. Sorreda must be reminded that the petition was dismissed not merely for defective verification but more so because the petition was evidently used as a substitute for a lost remedy of appeal. [14] We see no need to belabor the grounds for the dismissal of the other cases enumerated by counsel, said grounds having been stated in the respective minute resolutions which were plain, clear, simply worded and understandable to everyone, even to those who do not have a formal education in law.\u00a0 Suffice it to say that the dismissal of those petitions was the result of a thorough deliberation among members of this Court.\n\nAtty. Sorreda's imputation of manipulation in the assignment and raffle of cases is utterly baseless and at best a mere figment of his imagination.\n\nUnfounded accusations or allegations or words tending to embarrass the court or to bring it into disrepute have no place in a pleading. Their employment serves no useful purpose. On the contrary, they constitute direct contempt of court or contempt in facie curiae and a violation of the lawyer's oath and a transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\n\nIn Ang vs. Castro [15] , this Court held that if a pleading containing derogatory, offensive and malicious statements is submitted in the same court or judge in which the proceedings are pending, it is direct contempt, equivalent as it is to a misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the administration of justice.\u00a0 Direct contempt is punishable summarily. [16]\n\nAtty Sorreda's conduct likewise violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically -\nCANON 11 - A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others.\n\nx x x\n\nRule 11.03 - A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the courts.\n\nRule 11.04 - A lawyer shall not attribute to a judge motives not supported by the record or having no materiality to the case.\nWhile a lawyer owes absolute fidelity to the cause of his client, full devotion to his client's genuine interest and warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his client's rights, as well as the exertion of his utmost learning and ability, [17] he must do so only within the bounds of the law. [18] A lawyer is entitled to voice his criticism within the context of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech which must be exercised responsibly.\u00a0 After all, every right carries with it the corresponding obligation. Freedom is not freedom from responsibility, but freedom with responsibility. The lawyer's fidelity to his client must not be pursued at the expense of truth and orderly administration of justice.\u00a0 It must be done within the confines of reason and common sense. [19]\n\nAtty. Sorreda, as a citizen and as an officer of the court, is entitled to criticize the rulings of this Court, to point out where he feels the Court may have lapsed with error.\u00a0 But, certainly, this does not give him the unbridled license to insult and malign the Court and bring it into disrepute.\u00a0 Against such an assault, the Court is duty-bound \"to act to preserve its honor and dignity and to safeguard the morals and ethics of the legal profession\". [20]\n\nThe eloquent words of the late Justice Conrado V. Sanchez in Rheem of the Philippines vs. Ferrer [21] are enlightening:\nBy now, a lawyer's duties to the Court have become commonplace. Really, there could hardly be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof. Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, in categorical terms, spells out one such duty: \"To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.\" As explicit is the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that \"[i]t is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.\" That same canon, as a corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to support the courts against \"unjust criticism and clamor.\" And more. The attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a conduct that should be \"with all good fidelity xxx to the courts.\" Worth remembering is that the duty of an attorney to the courts \"can only be maintained by rendering no service involving any disrespect to the judicial office which he is bound to uphold.\"\nIn Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel , [22] Justice Sanchez further elucidated:\nA lawyer is an officer of the courts; he is, \"like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.\" His duty is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts to which he owes fidelity, \" not to promote distrust in the administration of justice .\" Faith in the courts a lawyer should seek to preserve. For, to undermine the judicial edifice \"is disastrous to the continuity of government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people.\" Thus has it been said of a lawyer that \"[a]s an officer of the court, it is his sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice.\"\nLikewise, in Zaldivar vs. Gonzales , [23] we held:\nRespondent Gonzales is entitled to the constitutional guarantee of free speech.\u00a0 No one seeks to deny him that right, least of all this Court.\u00a0 What respondent seems unaware of is that freedom of speech and of expression, like all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute and that freedom of expression needs an occasion to be adjusted to and accommodated with the requirement of equally important public interests.\u00a0 One of these fundamental public interests is the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the administration of justice.\u00a0 There is no antimony between free expression and the integrity of the system of administering justice.\u00a0 For the protection and maintenance of freedom of expression itself can be secured only within the context of a functioning and orderly system of dispensing justice, with the context, in other words, of viable independent institutions for delivery of justice which are accepted by the general community.\nAs officer of the court, Atty. Sorreda has the duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts and to promote confidence in the fair administration of justice. [24] No less must this be and with greater reasons in the case of the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, as the last bulwark of justice and democracy\n\nAtty. Sorreda must be reminded that his first duty is not to his client but to the administration of justice, to which his client's success is wholly subordinate.\u00a0 His conduct ought to and must always be scrupulously observant of law and ethics.\u00a0 The use of intemperate language and unkind ascription can hardly be justified nor can it have a place in the dignity of judicial forum.\u00a0 Civility among members of the legal profession is a treasured tradition that must at no time be lost to it. [25]\n\nHere, Atty. Sorreda has transcended the permissible bounds of fair comment and constructive criticism to the detriment of the orderly administration of justice. Free expression, after all, must not be used as a vehicle to satisfy one's irrational obsession to demean, ridicule, degrade and even destroy this Court and its magistrates. [26]\n\nWe have constantly reminded that any gross misconduct of a lawyer, whether in his professional or private capacity, puts his moral character in serious doubt as a member of the Bar, and renders him unfit to continue in the practice of law. [27]\n\nIn the very recent similar case of Tacardon, et al vs. Ponce Enrile , [28] we imposed on the respondent therein the penalty of suspension from the Bar.\u00a0 Here, as in Tacardon , we find the exclusion of Atty.

OANIA, REPRESENTED BY HIS SISTER ELIZABETH REYES, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND FLORENCIA BRAVO, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to annul and set aside the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated January 31, 2001 in CA-G.R. SP No. 58952 and its Resolution [2] of October 26, 2001, \u201cinsofar as it [CA] denied bail to the petitioner during the pendency of his appeal, and to grant bail to the petitioner.\u201d [3]\n\nThe antecedent facts of the petition are as follows:\n\nIn an Information dated May 10, 1993, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-43186, herein petitioner was charged with Homicide before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City.\n\nPetitioner posted bail guaranteed by the surety bond of Oriental Assurance Corporation (Oriental), a domestic corporation then holding offices in Caloocan City, Pasig City, and Escolta, Manila.\n\nUpon arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, trial ensued.\n\nAfter trial, the RTC set the Decision for promulgation on December 7, 1999.\u00a0 The notice of promulgation was served on petitioner at the address he gave on record.\u00a0 The Notice was received on November 12, 1999 by a certain Ana Pijo, who claimed to be an aunt of petitioner.\n\nNotices of the promulgation were also sent to Oriental at its three different addresses appearing on record.\u00a0 However, the notice sent at Oriental's Caloocan address was returned unclaimed because the corporation was no longer holding office there.\u00a0 The notice sent at Oriental's Pasig City address was received on December 7, 1999, while the one sent to its office in Manila was received only on December 9, 1999, two days after the promulgation of the Decision of the RTC.\n\nOn December 7, 1999, the RTC promulgated its Decision convicting petitioner of the crime of Homicide and accordingly penalized him pursuant to the Revised Penal Code. [4]\n\nHowever, petitioner was absent during the promulgation of the decision despite notice, and his absence was unexplained.\u00a0 This prompted the RTC to issue an Order directing the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of petitioner and for the confiscation of his bail bond. [5]\n\nOn April 7, 2000, petitioner was arrested.\u00a0 Thereafter, the RTC issued a Commitment Order committing petitioner to the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa City for service of sentence.\n\nOn April 12, 2000, petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal as well as a Motion to Lift Order of Arrest and to Enjoy Temporary Liberty Pending Appeal Under the Same Bond.\n\nOn May 5, 2000, the trial court issued an Order denying petitioner's Notice of Appeal on the ground that it had been filed out of time.\u00a0 The RTC also denied petitioner's Motion to Lift Order of Arrest and to Enjoy Temporary Liberty Pending Appeal Under the Same Bond. [6]\n\nIn its Order dated May 15, 2000, the RTC denied petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration. [7]\n\nPetitioner then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the CA contending that the presiding judge of the RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 124, acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the questioned Orders.\u00a0 He claimed that he did not receive any notice of the date of promulgation of the judgment in the subject case and neither did he know of the decision nor receive a copy thereof.\u00a0 He also asserted that he only came to know of the Decision in Criminal Case No. C-43186 on April 7, 2000, the day that he was arrested.\u00a0 Based on these premises, petitioner insisted that his bail bond should not have been confiscated and that he should not have been arrested. He also argued that the period for filing his Notice of Appeal should have started only on the day that he was arrested because it was only then that he came to know of the trial court's decision in his case.\n\nOn January 31, 2001, the CA rendered a Decision with the following dispositive portion:\nWHEREFORE, upon the foregoing premises, this petition is hereby partially GRANTED. The Orders dated May 5 and 15, 2000 of the court a quo are MODIFIED. The Notice of Appeal filed by petitioner in Criminal Case No. C-43186 is given due course and the records of the case are ordered elevated to this Court. However, the motion to lift order of arrest is denied for lack of merit. No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8]\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution of October 26, 2001.\n\nHence, herein petition raising the issues of whether the petitioner was duly notified of the promulgation of the RTC Decision on December 7, 1999; whether his absence was without justifiable cause; and whether the order for his detention during his appeal is correct, valid, and proper.\n\nOn June 28, 2002, and while the present petition was pending with this Court, the CA issued its Decision in CA-G.R. CR No. 24995, entitled \u201c People of the Philippines v. Edgardo Oania y Mugot \u201d which disposed of the appeal taken by petitioner from the RTC Decision finding him guilty of Homicide in Criminal Case No. C-43186. \u00a0The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, above premises all considered, the judgment of the trial court contained in its assailed Decision, finding accused-appellant Edgardo Oania y Mugot guilty beyond reasonable doubt, of the crime charged, is hereby AFFIRMED . However, the penalty of imprisonment imposed on the accused is hereby MODIFIED . Accused-appellant, Edgardo Oania y Mugot is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of ten (10) years of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal as maximum and to suffer all the accessory penalties as provided by law. The awards of damages by the lower court against the accused in favor of the heirs of the victim, Rogelio Bravo, are hereby AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\nCourt records bear out that herein petitioner did not appeal the above-quoted CA Decision and that on July 20, 2002, the said Decision became final and executory. In fact, Entry of Judgment had been issued by the CA and the original records have been transmitted to the RTC.\u00a0 Inevitably, the issues raised in the instant petition have been rendered moot and academic.\n\nAs such, it is unnecessary to indulge in academic discussion of a case presenting a moot question, as a judgment thereon cannot have any practical legal effect, or in the nature of things, cannot be enforced. [9] The Court will refrain from expressing its opinion in a case where no practical relief may be granted in view of a supervening event. [10]\n\nWHEREFORE , the instant petition is DISMISSED for having been rendered moot and academic by the finality of the Decision in CA-G.R.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. CHARLITO TUMULAK, APPELLANT.R E S O L U T I O N NACHURA, J.: This Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the July 19, 2006 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. H.C. No. 00107 which affirmed with modification the Judgment[2] rendered by Branch 25 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City, finding appellant Charlito Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide.In an Information[3] dated March 26, 1998, Charlito Tumulak (Charlito) was charged for parricide committed as follows:That on or about February 10, 1998, at more or less 4:00 o\u2019 clock in the afternoon at Purok 3, Poblacion, Municipality of Claveria, Province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with deliberate intent and with intent to kill, then and there, willfully, unlawfully boxed and mauled and feloniously beaten (sic) and strike with the used (sic) of hard object his father Marcelino Tumulak, thereby inflicting serious physical injuries on different parts of the body of the victim which causes (sic) his instantaneous death.Charlito pleaded not guilty. Trial on the merits then ensued with the prosecution presenting: (i) Regalada Decena-Tumulak, Marcelino\u2019s wife; Dr. David Mendoza, the Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the post-mortem examination of Marcelino; and (iii) Judge Romeo Ambongan Almajar of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Jasaan, Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the preliminary investigation of the case. The prosecution\u2019s version of the incident is as follows:On a Vespera of the fiesta of the Municipality of Claveria, Misamis Oriental at about 4:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, Regalada Decena, wife of the victim, witnessed accused Charlito Tumulak mauled (sic) and beat his father Marcelino Tumulak inside their house by boxing, kicking and striking him with hard objects on different parts of his body.Marcelino Tumulak, a sexagenarian, is short in height, small in body built, and skinny. He enjoyed a temporary relief when Regalada Decena, the second wife out of martyrdom, covered the body of Marcelino Tumulak absorbing the body blows of the fist of the son Charlito Tumulak, who rested for a while. Charlie Tumulak poured kerosene on Marcelino and Regalada. He resumed the punishment of his father Marcelino by kicking him. Marcelino Tumulak collected his wits and marshaled his last ounce of strength and managed to escaped (sic) and walk towards the house of Roel Chalico and his wife Sabina.She further testified that Charlie Tumulak mauled and beat his father to death because he had a grudge on his father who burned his own chicken cage used by Charlie Tumulak.Regalada Decena, instead of following her husband to the house of her sister, Sabina Chalico, went directly to the Tanod and reported the incident.The Barangay Tanod, accompanied by Regalada Decena, went to the scene and found the lifeless and mangled body of Marcelino.Dr. David A. Mendoza, Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, conducted an external examination of the Cadaver of Marcelino Tumulak at the scene of the crime at Banban Ani-e, Claveria, Misamis, Oriental.He issued a Certificate of Death which indicated the cause of death as Internal Hemorrhage probably due to blunt trauma R/O fracturing of the 6th \u2013 7th rib.Judge Romeo Almajar, the Presiding Judge of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Jasaan Claveria, Misamis, Oriental, testified that when he asked accused Charlie Tumulak about his counter-affidavit, during the preliminary investigation accused Charlie Tumulak admitted having mauled and beat his father as shown in his resolution.[4]Only appellant testified for his defense. He denied killing his father and declared that he had a good relationship with him and his stepmother. On February 10, 1998, he was in the cockpit arena from 1:00 until 5:00 in the afternoon. Thereafter, he proceeded to Patring Tagarda\u2019s house in Purok 3, Claveria, Misamis Oriental. He never went to his father\u2019s house on that day.Not persuaded by appellant\u2019s denial and alibi, the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction, viz.:Wherefore, premises considered, this court hereby finds the accused Charlie Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide with the attendance of one generic aggravating circumstance of cruelty and sentences the accused Charlie Tumulak to death by LETHAL INJECTION and to indemnify the surviving spouse actual damages the sum of eleven thousand pesos (P11,000.00) as funeral expenses and indemnity of seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00), and seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages and to pay the cost.The accused is, likewise, credited in the service of his sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty with the full time during which [he had] undergone preventive imprisonment.SO ORDERED.[5]Initially, this case was brought to this Court for automatic review with the case docketed as G.R. No. 145448.In his Brief, appellant assigned the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:ITHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING AGAINST ACCUSED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY.IITHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON THE ACCUSED THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH.[6]The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) also filed its Brief,[7] recommending the modification of the penalty imposed upon the accused, and the damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heirs, arguing that:ITHE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY IN IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF DEATH ON APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE SAID AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT STATED IN THE INFORMATION.IITHE LOWER COURT\u2019S AWARD OF ACTUAL DAMAGES HAS NO FACTUAL BASIS: CIVIL INDEMNITY AND MORAL DAMAGES AWARDED ARE EXCESSIVE.[8]However, on September 7, 2004, the Court transferred this case to the CA consistent with its ruling in People v. Mateo.[9]On July 19, 2006, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, affirming with modification appellant\u2019s conviction. In modifying the penalty, the appellate court held that the RTC erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the imposable penalty because it had not been alleged in the Information. The CA, likewise, deleted the award of actual damages for lack of factual basis and reduced the civil indemnity and moral damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heir. The dispositive portion of the CA\u2019s Decision reads:FOR THE REASONS STATED, the appealed Judgment finding appellant Charlito Tumulak GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of parricide is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that he shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and pay the surviving spouse the sums of: P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00. The award of P11,000.00 as actual damages is deleted.SO ORDERED.[10]Appellant is now before the Court reiterating his contention. Both the OSG and the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), counsel for the accused, reiterated the arguments in their respective briefs filed during the pendency of this case upon automatic review and prior to its transfer to the CA.Despite appellant\u2019s assignment of errors, this Court, nonetheless, resolved to review not only the penalty imposed on the appellant but also his very conviction pursuant to the doctrine that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case open for review.[11] After a meticulous review of the records, this Court upholds the conviction of the appellant.We agree with the courts below that the evidence for the prosecution meets the requisite evidence beyond reasonable doubt.Regalada positively identified the appellant as the culprit. Both the trial court and the appellate court found her testimony credible. It is doctrinal that findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses deserve a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing that the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could reverse a judgment of conviction. In fact, in some instances, such findings are even accorded finality. This is so because the assignment of value to a witness\u2019 testimony is essentially the domain of the trial court, not to mention that it is the trial judge who has the direct opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness on the stand which opportunity provides him unique facility in determining whether or not to accord credence to the testimony or whether the witness is telling the truth or not.[12]Appellant's weak defense of denial and alibi cannot stand a chance against the declaration of Regalada identifying him as the killer and describing the manner in which he perpetrated the crime. We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. They are facile to fabricate and difficult to disprove, and are generally rejected.[13]Besides, for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity.[14] Apart from testifying that he never went to his father\u2019s house in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, appellant was unable to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.Furthermore, appellant failed to show that Regalada was prompted by any ill motive to falsely testify or accuse him of killing his father. Appellant himself admitted that he had a good relationship with his stepmother. The Court adheres to the established rule that, in the absence of any evidence showing reason or motive for the witness to perjure, their testimony and identification of the assailant should be given full faith and credit.[15]Between the categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses, on one hand, and the bare denial of appellants, on the other, the former must perforce prevail. An affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. They are considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable but also because they are easily fabricated and concocted.[16] Appellant's challenge of his conviction is starkly puerile.Under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 5 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, the penalty for parricide is composed of two indivisible penalties, reclusion perpetua to death. The CA was correct in disregarding the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the proper penalty because it has not been alleged in the Information. We, therefore, sustain the appellate court in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua.As to the monetary awards imposable, a modification is in order. In addition to the CA\u2019s award of P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages, temperate damages of P10,000.00 must also be awarded to the heirs of Marcelino. Regalada testified that the family incurred expenses for funeral and burial expenses, but she was not able to present receipts. It is settled that where the amount of actual damages cannot be determined because no receipts were presented to prove the same, but it is shown that the heirs are entitled thereto, temperate damages may be awarded.[17] Considering that funeral expenses were obviously incurred by the victim\u2019s heirs, an award of temperate damages is proper.WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. HC-No. 00107 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Appellant Charlito Tumulak is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide as defined in Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance in the commission of the crime, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of Marcelino Tumulak the amount of P10,000.00 as temperate damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario, and Reyes, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Edgardo A.

No. 177299, November 28, 2007 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. CHARLITO TUMULAK, APPELLANT.R E S O L U T I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. CHARLITO TUMULAK, APPELLANT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nNACHURA, J.:\n\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the July 19, 2006 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. H.C. No. 00107 which affirmed with modification the Judgment [2] rendered by Branch 25 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City, finding appellant Charlito Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide.\n\nIn an Information [3] dated March 26, 1998, Charlito Tumulak (Charlito) was charged for parricide committed as follows:\nThat on or about February 10, 1998, at more or less 4:00 o\u2019 clock in the afternoon at Purok 3, Poblacion, Municipality of Claveria, Province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with deliberate intent and with intent to kill, then and there, willfully, unlawfully boxed and mauled and feloniously beaten (sic) and strike with the used (sic) of hard object his father Marcelino Tumulak, thereby inflicting serious physical injuries on different parts of the body of the victim which causes (sic) his instantaneous death. Charlito pleaded not guilty. Trial on the merits then ensued with the prosecution presenting: (i) Regalada Decena-Tumulak, Marcelino\u2019s wife; Dr. David Mendoza, the Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the post-mortem examination of Marcelino; and (iii) Judge Romeo Ambongan Almajar of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Jasaan, Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the preliminary investigation of the case. The prosecution\u2019s version of the incident is as follows:\nOn a Vespera of the fiesta of the Municipality of Claveria, Misamis Oriental at about 4:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, Regalada Decena, wife of the victim, witnessed accused Charlito Tumulak mauled (sic) and beat his father Marcelino Tumulak inside their house by boxing, kicking and striking him with hard objects on different parts of his body.\n\nMarcelino Tumulak, a sexagenarian, is short in height, small in body built, and skinny. He enjoyed a temporary relief when Regalada Decena, the second wife out of martyrdom, covered the body of Marcelino Tumulak absorbing the body blows of the fist of the son Charlito Tumulak, who rested for a while. Charlie Tumulak poured kerosene on Marcelino and Regalada. He resumed the punishment of his father Marcelino by kicking him. Marcelino Tumulak collected his wits and marshaled his last ounce of strength and managed to escaped (sic) and walk towards the house of Roel Chalico and his wife Sabina.\n\nShe further testified that Charlie Tumulak mauled and beat his father to death because he had a grudge on his father who burned his own chicken cage used by Charlie Tumulak.\n\nRegalada Decena, instead of following her husband to the house of her sister, Sabina Chalico, went directly to the Tanod and reported the incident.\n\nThe Barangay Tanod, accompanied by Regalada Decena, went to the scene and found the lifeless and mangled body of Marcelino.\n\nDr. David A. Mendoza, Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, conducted an external examination of the Cadaver of Marcelino Tumulak at the scene of the crime at Banban Ani-e, Claveria, Misamis, Oriental.\n\nHe issued a Certificate of Death which indicated the cause of death as Internal Hemorrhage probably due to blunt trauma R/O fracturing of the 6 th \u2013 7th rib.\n\nJudge Romeo Almajar, the Presiding Judge of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Jasaan Claveria, Misamis, Oriental, testified that when he asked accused Charlie Tumulak about his counter-affidavit, during the preliminary investigation accused Charlie Tumulak admitted having mauled and beat his father as shown in his resolution. [4] Only appellant testified for his defense. He denied killing his father and declared that he had a good relationship with him and his stepmother. On February 10, 1998, he was in the cockpit arena from 1:00 until 5:00 in the afternoon. Thereafter, he proceeded to Patring Tagarda\u2019s house in Purok 3, Claveria, Misamis Oriental. He never went to his father\u2019s house on that day.\n\nNot persuaded by appellant\u2019s denial and alibi, the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction, viz.:\nWherefore, premises considered, this court hereby finds the accused Charlie Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide with the attendance of one generic aggravating circumstance of cruelty and sentences the accused Charlie Tumulak to death by LETHAL INJECTION and to indemnify the surviving spouse actual damages the sum of eleven thousand pesos (P11,000.00) as funeral expenses and indemnity of seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00), and seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages and to pay the cost.\n\nThe accused is, likewise, credited in the service of his sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty with the full time during which [he had] undergone preventive imprisonment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5] Initially, this case was brought to this Court for automatic review with the case docketed as G.R. No. 145448.\n\nIn his Brief, appellant assigned the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:\n\nI THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING AGAINST ACCUSED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY.\n\nII\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON THE ACCUSED THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH. [6] The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) also filed its Brief, [7] recommending the modification of the penalty imposed upon the accused, and the damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heirs, arguing that:\n\nI THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY IN IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF DEATH ON APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE SAID AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT STATED IN THE INFORMATION.\n\nII\nTHE LOWER COURT\u2019S AWARD OF ACTUAL DAMAGES HAS NO FACTUAL BASIS: CIVIL INDEMNITY AND MORAL DAMAGES AWARDED ARE EXCESSIVE. [8] However, on September 7, 2004, the Court transferred this case to the CA consistent with its ruling in People v. Mateo . [9]\n\nOn July 19, 2006, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, affirming with modification appellant\u2019s conviction. In modifying the penalty, the appellate court held that the RTC erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the imposable penalty because it had not been alleged in the Information. The CA, likewise, deleted the award of actual damages for lack of factual basis and reduced the civil indemnity and moral damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heir. The dispositive portion of the CA\u2019s Decision reads:\nFOR THE REASONS STATED , the appealed Judgment finding appellant Charlito Tumulak GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of parricide is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that he shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and pay the surviving spouse the sums of: P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00. The award of P11,000.00 as actual damages is deleted.\n\nSO ORDERED . [10] Appellant is now before the Court reiterating his contention. Both the OSG and the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), counsel for the accused, reiterated the arguments in their respective briefs filed during the pendency of this case upon automatic review and prior to its transfer to the CA.\n\nDespite appellant\u2019s assignment of errors, this Court, nonetheless, resolved to review not only the penalty imposed on the appellant but also his very conviction pursuant to the doctrine that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case open for review. [11] After a meticulous review of the records, this Court upholds the conviction of the appellant.\n\nWe agree with the courts below that the evidence for the prosecution meets the requisite evidence beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nRegalada positively identified the appellant as the culprit. Both the trial court and the appellate court found her testimony credible. It is doctrinal that findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses deserve a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing that the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could reverse a judgment of conviction. In fact, in some instances, such findings are even accorded finality. This is so because the assignment of value to a witness\u2019 testimony is essentially the domain of the trial court, not to mention that it is the trial judge who has the direct opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness on the stand which opportunity provides him unique facility in determining whether or not to accord credence to the testimony or whether the witness is telling the truth or not. [12]\n\nAppellant's weak defense of denial and alibi cannot stand a chance against the declaration of Regalada identifying him as the killer and describing the manner in which he perpetrated the crime. We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. They are facile to fabricate and difficult to disprove, and are generally rejected. [13]\n\nBesides, for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity. [14] Apart from testifying that he never went to his father\u2019s house in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, appellant was unable to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.\n\nFurthermore, appellant failed to show that Regalada was prompted by any ill motive to falsely testify or accuse him of killing his father. Appellant himself admitted that he had a good relationship with his stepmother. The Court adheres to the established rule that, in the absence of any evidence showing reason or motive for the witness to perjure, their testimony and identification of the assailant should be given full faith and credit. [15]\n\nBetween the categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses, on one hand, and the bare denial of appellants, on the other, the former must perforce prevail. An affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. They are considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable but also because they are easily fabricated and concocted. [16] Appellant's challenge of his conviction is starkly puerile.\n\nUnder Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 5 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, the penalty for parricide is composed of two indivisible penalties, reclusion perpetua to death. The CA was correct in disregarding the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the proper penalty because it has not been alleged in the Information. We, therefore, sustain the appellate court in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua.\n\nAs to the monetary awards imposable, a modification is in order. In addition to the CA\u2019s award of P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages, temperate damages of P10,000.00 must also be awarded to the heirs of Marcelino. Regalada testified that the family incurred expenses for funeral and burial expenses, but she was not able to present receipts. It is settled that where the amount of actual damages cannot be determined because no receipts were presented to prove the same, but it is shown that the heirs are entitled thereto, temperate damages may be awarded. [17] Considering that funeral expenses were obviously incurred by the victim\u2019s heirs, an award of temperate damages is proper.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. HC-No. 00107 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Appellant Charlito Tumulak is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide as defined in Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance in the commission of the crime, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of Marcelino Tumulak the amount of P10,000.00 as temperate damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario, and Reyes, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Edgardo A.

DUPAYA, CLERK IV; ROSELLER O. ISRAEL, CASHIER I; EMIL A. SIRIBAN, PROCESS SERVER; JAMES D. LORILLA, PROCESS SERVER, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nYNARES-SATIAGO, J.:\n\nFighting between court employees during office hours is a disgraceful behavior reflecting adversely on the good image of the judiciary.\u00a0 It displays a cavalier attitude towards the seriousness and dignity with which court business should be treated.\u00a0 Shouting at one another in the workplace and during office hours is arrant discourtesy and disrespect not only towards co-workers, but to the court as well. [1]\n\nOn July 26, 2001, the respondents, all court employees of Municipal Trial Court of Lal-lo, Cagayan, Branch 2, engaged in a verbal tussle which resulted in physical violence.\n\nWhen ordered [2] to explain their participation in the aforesaid incident, the respondents submitted their respective versions of the facts.\n\nRespondents Ulysses and Juliet Dupaya alleged that at around 10:00 a.m. of July 26, 2001, Juliet Dupaya and Leticia Israel had a heated argument.\u00a0 Ulysses, husband of Juliet, approached the two and told them to stop. Ulysses brought his wife to the office of the Clerk of Court followed by Leticia Israel. When the Dupaya spouses entered the office, respondent Roseller Israel, Leticia\u2019s husband, suddenly stood up from his desk and made a gesture to attack Ulysses.\u00a0 In defense, Ulysses pushed Roseller backwards.\u00a0 Respondent Emil Siriban attacked and boxed Ulysses in the face and in other parts of the body.\u00a0 Respondent James Lorilla intervened and prevented Emil from further attacking Ulysses.\n\nRoseller and Leticia alleged that at around 10:00 a.m. of July 26, 2001, while the two of them were sitting inside the Office of the Clerk of Court, the Dupaya spouses arrived and confronted Leticia. Ulysses asked Leticia in a threatening voice, \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d\u00a0 He raised his hand as if to slap the latter.\u00a0 When Roseller asked Ulysses what was wrong, the latter cursed him and hit him on the right cheek with his fist. [3] Thereafter, Ulysses turned to pick up a chair but respondent Emil Siriban told him not to harm Roseller.\u00a0 Ulysses turned towards Emil with his fist closed.\u00a0 Sensing danger, Emil swung his right hand towards Ulysses but failed to hit him.\u00a0 He threw another punch and hit the right neck of Ulysses. Roseller then pushed Ulysses towards the door of the office where the two of them grappled and fell to the ground. While Emil was trying to separate the two, Roseller was hit at the back by respondent James Lorilla.\u00a0 The other officemates of the respondents tried to pacify them but failed. It was only when the police arrived that the scuffle stopped.\n\nRespondent Emil Siriban corroborated the narration of the Israel spouses.\n\nOn August 7, 2001, Judge Briccio Aquino of the Municipal Trial Court of Lal-lo, Cagayan wrote a letter-complaint to the Office of the Court Administrator against respondents.\n\nOn August 4, 2003, the parties were required to manifest if they are willing to have the case resolved on the basis of the pleadings/records on file. On September 5, 2003, Judge Aquino manifested that, since the respondents have already patched up their differences and are now in good harmony with each other, the complaint should be dismissed and/or resolved in favor of the respondents.\u00a0 All the respondents submitted their joint manifestation stating that they have patched up their differences and that they are submitting the case with the prayer that the same be dismissed.\n\nWe find the respondents guilty of committing Misconduct in Office.\n\nTime and again, we have stressed that the conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice is circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. [4] The records reveal that the action of the respondents against each other fell short of this standard.\n\nMisconduct is a transgression of some established or definite rule of action; more particularly, it is an unlawful behavior by the public officer. [5] High-strung and belligerent behavior has no place in government service where the personnel are enjoined to act with self-restraint and civility at all times even when confronted with rudeness and insolence. [6] Such conduct is exacted from them so that they will earn and keep the public\u2019s respect for and confidence in the judicial service. [7] This standard is applied with respect to a court employee\u2019s dealings not only with the public but also with his or her co-workers in the service. Conduct violative of this standard quickly and surely corrodes respect for the courts. [8]\n\nNotwithstanding the allegation of both the complainant and the respondents that the parties have patched things up and have put the incident behind them, we will not shirk from our duty to impose the proper penalty upon the erring parties. The withdrawal or desistance of a complainant from pursuing an administrative complaint does not divest the Court of its disciplinary authority over court personnel. [9]\n\nWe take this opportunity to remind, not only the respondents, but all court personnel as well that the image of the judiciary is mirrored in the kind of conduct, official or otherwise, which the personnel within its employ display, from the judge to the lowliest clerk. Any fighting or misunderstanding becomes a disgraceful sight reflecting adversely on the good image of the judiciary. Professionalism, respect for the rights of others, good manners and right conduct are expected of all judicial officers and employees. Thus, all employees are required to preserve the judiciary\u2019s good name and standing as a true temple of justice. [10]\n\nWHEREFORE , respondents Leticia U. Israel, Roseller O. Israel, Juliet L. Dupaya, Ulysses D. Dupaya, Emil A. Siriban and James D. Lorilla are FINED One Thousand Pesos each for misconduct in office.\u00a0 All respondents are STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act(s) in the future shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J.

ANTONIO TOLEDO, LELITA TOLEDO, MAURO SUMULONG, OLIVA SUMULONG, PILAR TEVES, AS PRESIDENT AND MANAGER, RURAL BANK OF CARMEN (CEBU), INC., RESPONDENTS. DECISION YNARES-SATIAGO, J.: The property under litigation is a residential land with improvements thereon, consisting of 167 square meters, situated in Poblacion, Danao City, and covered by Tax Declaration No. 34951.[1]On December 26, 1973, petitioner Daria Gonzales Vda. de Toledo executed a Special Power of Attorney authorizing her stepson, Antonio Toledo, to obtain loan from a bank and mortgage the subject property as security therefor.[2] On January 4, 1974, Spouses Antonio and Lelita Toledo obtained a loan from Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. in the amount of P2,467.80 secured by a real estate mortgage constituted on subject property.[3]The Toledo spouses failed to pay their loan to the Bank despite several demands.[4] Hence, on July 6, 1981, the Bank extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage. Accordingly, the property was sold at public auction, with the Bank as the sole and highest bidder. Correspondingly, the Bank was issued a Certificate of Sale[5] upon satisfaction of the obligations of spouses Toledo in the amount of P5,014.00, including interests, penalty, attorney's fees and miscellaneous expenses.[6] The sale was registered with the Register of Deeds of Danao City on September 23, 1981.Spouses Toledo failed to redeem the subject property, thus the Bank caused the consolidation of ownership and the execution of the final deed of sale in its favor on November 16, 1983.[7] On August 23, 1985, the Bank sold the said parcel of land to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong.[8] However, petitioner remained on the property together with spouses Toledo.On February 18, 1986, petitioner filed a complaint against the Spouses Toledo and the Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu), Inc., and the Spouses Sumulong, for Declaration of Nullity of Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage and Sales, Reconveyance with Damages before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch XXV, docketed as Civil Case No. DNA-48.[9] She alleged that the Toledo spouses preconceived a malicious, sinister and scheming idea to induce her to execute a Special Power of Attorney to mortgage her property to the Bank and, thereafter, connived with the Sumulongs in foreclosing the mortgage. It appears that previously, or on November 18, 1985, petitioner deposited P5,200.00 with the Bank in order to redeem the subject property.[10]On June 11, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision[11] declaring the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings of the subject property a total nullity. Consequently, the Certificate of Sale, Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the Bank in favor of the Sumulong spouses were declared null and void, thus: [12] WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the Extra-Judicial Foreclosure proceedings of plaintiff's property a total nullity, consequently, the Certificate of Sale (Exh. \"7-Bank\"), Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale (Exh. \"8\"-Bank), and the Deed of Sale executed by defendant Rural Bank of Carmen in favor of defendants spouses Mauro Sumulong and Oliva Sumulong (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) are hereby declared null and void, and for which reason, the defendants spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong are hereby directed to reconvey the property subject of the foreclosure sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) in favor of the plaintiff by directing the defendant Rural Bank of Carmen to return to said defendants-spouses the amount of P5,000.00 as consideration thereof and, in turn, accepting the deposit of P5,200.00 made by plaintiff with said defendant Bank (Exh. \"A\") and returning the balance of P200.00 to the plaintiff; ordering the City Assessor of Danao City to cancel Tax Declaration No. 02391 (Exh. \"2\"-Sumulong) in the name of Spouses Oliva Sumulong and Mauro Sumulong and issue another tax declaration, in lieu thereof, in the name of plaintiff Daria G. Toledo; ordering finally, the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, to the plaintiff the sums of P20,000.00 as moral damages, P20,000.00 as exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs of the suit.The counterclaims are hereby dismissed.[13]Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a decision on July 24, 2001, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises above considered and pursuant to applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter and evidence on hand, judgment is hereby rendered granting the appeal. The assailed decision of court a quo is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered dismissing the complaint filed before the trial court by plaintiff-appellee against defendants-appellants in Civil Case No. DNA-448. No costs.[14]Hence, the instant petition for review on the following assignment of errors: THE COURT OF APPEALS APPLIED WRONGLY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3, ACT 3135 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASETHE COURT OF APPEALS WRONGLY APPLIED SECTION 5, R.A. NO. 720 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASETHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE FAILURE OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU TO COMPLY WITH SEC. 3305.1 OF THE CENTRAL BANK MANUAL OF REGULATIONS BOOK IIITHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE EXECUTED BY THE PRESIDENT/MANAGER OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS SPOUSES MAURO AND OLIVA SUMULONG WAS NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT DID NOT SHOW THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS GAVE HER AUTHORITY TO DO SO.[15]We find merit in the petition.At the outset, we noted that for failure to submit proof of service,[16] petitioner's motion for extension of thirty (30) days from August 15, 2001 within which to file the petition was denied. Thus, when petitioner filed the instant petition on September 13, 2001, it was filed out of time. This procedural lapse on the part of petitioner would have warranted the outright dismissal of the petition. However, in Sebastian and Cardenas v. Morales, et al.,[17] we held: Under Rule 1, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, liberal construction of the Rules is the controlling principle to effect substantial justice. Thus, litigations should, as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicalities. This does not mean, however that procedural rules are to be ignored or disdained at will to suit the convenience of a party. Procedural law has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely, to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism, or whimsically in the settlement of disputes. Hence, it is a mistake to suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to each other, or as often suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it would result in prejudice to the substantive rights of the litigants.x x x Hence, rules of procedure must be faithfully followed except only when for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. x x xIn the instant case, we recognize the need to relax the rules of procedure to relieve the petitioner of an injustice not commensurate with her failure to comply with the rules. For this reason, the case shall be decided on the merits.Section 3, Act 3135, as amended provides: Notice shall be given by posting notices of sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places in the municipality where the property is situated, and if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city. (Italics Supplied)Corollary thereto, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 720 as amended by Republic Act No. 5939[18] reads: The foreclosure of mortgages covering loans granted by rural banks shall be exempt from the publication in newspapers where the total amount of the loan, including interests due and unpaid, does not exceed three thousand pesos. It shall be sufficient publication in such cases if the notices of foreclosure are posted in at least three of the most conspicuous public places in the municipality and barrio where the land mortgaged is situated during the period of sixty days immediately preceding the public auction. Proof of publication as required herein shall be accomplished by affidavit of the sheriff or officer conducting the foreclosure sale and shall be attached with the records of the case: x x x. (Emphasis supplied)The foregoing provision, in exempting foreclosures by rural banks from the publication requirement when the total amount of the loan including interests due and unpaid does not exceed three thousand pesos (P3,000.00), clearly refers to the total amount of the loan along with interests and not merely the balance thereof.At the time of foreclosure in the case at bar, the total amount of petitioners' loan including interests due and unpaid with the Bank was P4,652.80.[19] Clearly, therefore, publication of notices of auction sale in newspapers of general circulation in the city or municipality where the property is situated was necessary.Undisputedly, the Bank did not publish the notices of auction sale in a newspaper of general circulation. It merely posted the notices of auction sale in three conspicuous places including where the property was located. Considering that the auction sale of the subject property to the Bank is void, no valid title passed in its favor. Consequently, the sale of the same property to spouses Sumulong is also a nullity. Nemo dat quod non habet. One cannot give what one does not have.[20]In Lucena and Parales v. Court of Appeals, Rural Bank of Naujan, et al.,[21] this Court ruled that failure to comply with statutory requirements as to publication of notice of auction sale constitutes a jurisdictional defect which invalidates the sale. Even slight deviations therefrom are not allowed.The Sumulong spouses, nevertheless, argue that assuming the Bank's title over the contested property is a nullity, they were nevertheless innocent purchasers for value who have better rights than the petitioner. One is considered an innocent purchaser who acquired the property for a valuable consideration not knowing that the title of the vendor or grantor was null and void.[22]The evidence on record shows that the Sumulong spouses are not purchasers in good faith. Well-settled is the rule that the person who asserts the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value has the burden of proving such assertion.[23] The Sumulongs failed to discharge this burden.It appears that the Sumulongs did not make any reasonable inquiry regarding the status of the land in question, despite being aware that the property was still in the possession of the petitioner and respondent spouses Toledo. Indeed, petitioner and spouses Toledo occupied the same house on the subject property. The Sumulongs did not exert any effort to communicate directly with petitioner.All that the Sumulongs did was to rely on the title of the Bank. They, however, had notice that possession of the property was with a person other than the vendor bank. It was thus incumbent upon them to look beyond the title to the subject property and make the necessary inquiries. This they neglected to do.A purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man upon his guard, and then claim that he acted in good faith under the belief that there was no defect in the title of the vendor. His mere refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor's title, will not make him an innocent purchaser for value, if it afterwards develops that the title was in fact defective, and it appears that he had such notice of the defect as would have led to its discovery had he acted with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a prudent man in a like situation.[24]In De Guzman, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,[25] we held that the failure of appellees to take the ordinary precautions which a prudent man would have taken under the circumstances, specially in buying a piece of land in the actual, visible and public possession of another person, other than the vendor, constitutes gross negligence amounting to bad faith. One who purchases real property which is in the actual possession of another should, at least make some inquiry concerning the right of those in possession. The actual possession by a person other than the vendor should, at least put the purchaser upon inquiry. He can scarcely, in the absence of such inquiry, be regarded as a bona fide purchaser as against such possessors. [26]Having arrived at the conclusion that the petitioner is still entitled to reconveyance of the subject property, we find it no longer necessary to pass upon the third and fourth issues raised by the petitioner.All told, the auction sale of the subject property is null and void for failure of Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. to comply with the statutory requirements on publication of the notices of sale. The Bank did not acquire title over the said property and it transferred no valid title to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong who were not bona fide purchasers thereof. The property not having passed to innocent purchasers for value, reconveyance is still available.[27]With respect to the damages awarded, the trial court correctly held that there is no convincing proof to support petitioner's allegation that she incurred P3,000.00 as actual damages. In determining actual damages, the court cannot rely on mere assertions, speculations, conjectures or guesswork but must depend on competent evidence and on the best evidence obtainable regarding the actual loss.[28] Likewise, the trial court soundly exercised its discretion when it awarded moral damages in the amount of P20,000.00, based on the circumstances of the case at bar.[29] However, there is no factual basis for the award of exemplary damages. Petitioner failed to establish that the Bank colluded with the Toledo spouses and the Sumulong spouses in depriving her of the parcel of land in question.WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The July 24, 2001 Decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The July 11, 1993 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Danao City, Branch 25 in Civil Case No. DNA-48, which found the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings of the subject property a total nullity and declared the Certificate of Sale, Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. in favor of spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong null and void, is REINSTATED with the MODIFICATION that the award of exemplary damages in favor of the petitioner is DELETED for lack of factual basis.SO ORDERED.Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Panganiban, Carpio, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.

[1]\n\nOn December 26, 1973, petitioner Daria Gonzales Vda . de Toledo executed a Special Power of Attorney authorizing her stepson, Antonio Toledo, to obtain loan from a bank and mortgage the subject property as security therefor. [2] On January 4, 1974, Spouses Antonio and Lelita Toledo obtained a loan from Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. in the amount of P2,467.80 secured by a real estate mortgage constituted on subject property. [3]\n\nThe Toledo spouses failed to pay their loan to the Bank despite several demands. [4] Hence, on July 6, 1981, the Bank extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage. Accordingly, the property was sold at public auction, with the Bank as the sole and highest bidder. Correspondingly, the Bank was issued a Certificate of Sale [5] upon satisfaction of the obligations of spouses Toledo in the amount of P5,014.00, including interests, penalty, attorney's fees and miscellaneous expenses. [6] The sale was registered with the Register of Deeds of Danao City on September 23, 1981.\n\nSpouses Toledo failed to redeem the subject property, thus the Bank caused the consolidation of ownership and the execution of the final deed of sale in its favor on November 16, 1983. [7] On August 23, 1985, the Bank sold the said parcel of land to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong. [8] However, petitioner remained on the property together with spouses Toledo.\n\nOn February 18, 1986, petitioner filed a complaint against the Spouses Toledo and the Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu), Inc., and the Spouses Sumulong, for Declaration of Nullity of Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage and Sales, Reconveyance with Damages before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch XXV, docketed as Civil Case No. DNA-48. [9] She alleged that the Toledo spouses preconceived a malicious, sinister and scheming idea to induce her to execute a Special Power of Attorney to mortgage her property to the Bank and, thereafter, connived with the Sumulongs in foreclosing the mortgage. It appears that previously, or on November 18, 1985, petitioner deposited P5,200.00 with the Bank in order to redeem the subject property. [10]\n\nOn June 11, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision [11] declaring the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings of the subject property a total nullity. Consequently, the Certificate of Sale, Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the Bank in favor of the Sumulong spouses were declared null and void, thus: [12]\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the Extra-Judicial Foreclosure proceedings of plaintiff's property a total nullity, consequently, the Certificate of Sale (Exh. \"7-Bank\"), Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale (Exh. \"8\"-Bank), and the Deed of Sale executed by defendant Rural Bank of Carmen in favor of defendants spouses Mauro Sumulong and Oliva Sumulong (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) are hereby declared null and void, and for which reason, the defendants spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong are hereby directed to reconvey the property subject of the foreclosure sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) in favor of the plaintiff by directing the defendant Rural Bank of Carmen to return to said defendants-spouses the amount of P5,000.00 as consideration thereof and, in turn, accepting the deposit of P5,200.00 made by plaintiff with said defendant Bank (Exh. \"A\") and returning the balance of P200.00 to the plaintiff; ordering the City Assessor of Danao City to cancel Tax Declaration No. 02391 (Exh. \"2\"-Sumulong) in the name of Spouses Oliva Sumulong and Mauro Sumulong and issue another tax declaration, in lieu thereof, in the name of plaintiff Daria G. Toledo; ordering finally, the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, to the plaintiff the sums of P20,000.00 as moral damages, P20,000.00 as exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs of the suit.\n\nThe counterclaims are hereby dismissed. [13] Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a decision on July 24, 2001, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises above considered and pursuant to applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter and evidence on hand, judgment is hereby rendered granting the appeal. The assailed decision of court a quo is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered dismissing the complaint filed before the trial court by plaintiff-appellee against defendants-appellants in Civil Case No. DNA-448.\u00a0 No costs. [14] Hence, the instant petition for review on the following assignment of errors:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS APPLIED WRONGLY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3, ACT 3135 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASE\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS WRONGLY APPLIED SECTION 5, R.A. NO.\u00a0 720 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASE\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE FAILURE OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU TO COMPLY WITH SEC. 3305.1 OF THE CENTRAL BANK MANUAL OF REGULATIONS BOOK III\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE EXECUTED BY THE PRESIDENT/MANAGER OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS SPOUSES MAURO AND OLIVA SUMULONG WAS NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT DID NOT SHOW THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS GAVE HER AUTHORITY TO DO SO. [15] We find merit in the petition.\n\nAt the outset, we noted that for failure to submit proof of service, [16] petitioner's motion for extension of thirty (30) days from August 15, 2001 within which to file the petition was denied.\u00a0 Thus, when petitioner filed the instant petition on September 13, 2001, it was filed out of time. This procedural lapse on the part of petitioner would have warranted the outright dismissal of the petition.\u00a0 However, in Sebastian and Cardenas v.

(Italics Supplied)\nCorollary thereto, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 720 as amended by Republic Act No. 5939 [18] reads:\nThe foreclosure of mortgages covering loans granted by rural banks shall be exempt from the publication in newspapers where the total amount of the loan, including interests due and unpaid, does not exceed three thousand pesos . It shall be sufficient publication in such cases if the notices of foreclosure are posted in at least three of the most conspicuous public places in the municipality and barrio where the land mortgaged is situated during the period of sixty days immediately preceding the public auction. Proof of publication as required herein shall be accomplished by affidavit of the sheriff or officer conducting the foreclosure sale and shall be attached with the records of the case: x x x. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe foregoing provision, in exempting foreclosures by rural banks from the publication requirement when the total amount of the loan including interests due and unpaid does not exceed three thousand pesos (P3,000.00), clearly refers to the total amount of the loan along with interests and not merely the balance thereof.\n\nAt the time of foreclosure in the case at bar, the total amount of petitioners' loan including interests due and unpaid with the Bank was P4,652.80. [19] Clearly, therefore, publication of notices of auction sale in newspapers of general circulation in the city or municipality where the property is situated was necessary.\n\nUndisputedly, the Bank did not publish the notices of auction sale in a newspaper of general circulation. It merely posted the notices of auction sale in three conspicuous places including where the property was located. Considering that the auction sale of the subject property to the Bank is void, no valid title passed in its favor. Consequently, the sale of the same property to spouses Sumulong is also a nullity. Nemo dat quod non habet . One cannot give what one does not have. [20]\n\nIn Lucena and Parales v. Court of Appeals, Rural Bank of Naujan, et al. , [21] this Court ruled that failure to comply with statutory requirements as to publication of notice of auction sale constitutes a jurisdictional defect which invalidates the sale. Even slight deviations therefrom are not allowed.\n\nThe Sumulong spouses, nevertheless, argue that assuming the Bank's title over the contested property is a nullity, they were nevertheless innocent purchasers for value who have better rights than the petitioner. One is considered an innocent purchaser who acquired the property for a valuable consideration not knowing that the title of the vendor or grantor was null and void. [22]\n\nThe evidence on record shows that the Sumulong spouses are not purchasers in good faith. Well-settled is the rule that the person who asserts the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value has the burden of proving such assertion. [23] The Sumulongs failed to discharge this burden.\n\nIt appears that the Sumulongs did not make any reasonable inquiry regarding the status of the land in question, despite being aware that the property was still in the possession of the petitioner and respondent spouses Toledo.\u00a0 Indeed, petitioner and spouses Toledo occupied the same house on the subject property. The Sumulongs did not exert any effort to communicate directly with petitioner.\n\nAll that the Sumulongs did was to rely on the title of the Bank.\u00a0 They, however, had notice that possession of the property was with a person other than the vendor bank. It was thus incumbent upon them to look beyond the title to the subject property and make the necessary inquiries. This they neglected to do.\n\nA purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man upon his guard, and then claim that he acted in good faith under the belief that there was no defect in the title of the vendor.\u00a0 His mere refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor's title, will not make him an innocent purchaser for value, if it afterwards develops that the title was in fact defective, and it appears that he had such notice of the defect as would have led to its discovery had he acted with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a prudent man in a like situation. [24]\n\nIn De Guzman, Jr. v. Court of Appeals , [25] we held that the failure of appellees to take the ordinary precautions which a prudent man would have taken under the circumstances, specially in buying a piece of land in the actual, visible and public possession of another person, other than the vendor, constitutes gross negligence amounting to bad faith. One who purchases real property which is in the actual possession of another should, at least make some inquiry concerning the right of those in possession.\u00a0 The actual possession by a person other than the vendor should, at least put the purchaser upon inquiry.\u00a0 He can scarcely, in the absence of such inquiry, be regarded as a bona fide purchaser as against such possessors. [26]\n\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the petitioner is still entitled to reconveyance of the subject property, we find it no longer necessary to pass upon the third and fourth issues raised by the petitioner.\n\nAll told, the auction sale of the subject property is null and void for failure of Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. to comply with the statutory requirements on publication of the notices of sale. The Bank did not acquire title over the said property and it transferred no valid title to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong who were not bona fide purchasers thereof. The property not having passed to innocent purchasers for value, reconveyance is still available. [27]\n\nWith respect to the damages awarded, the trial court correctly held that there is no convincing proof to support petitioner's allegation that she incurred P3,000.00 as actual damages. In determining actual damages, the court cannot rely on mere assertions, speculations, conjectures or guesswork but must depend on competent evidence and on the best evidence obtainable regarding the actual loss.

      "title": "BELEN A. SALVACION, PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) AND LEO H. MANLAPAS, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CHICO-NAZARIO, J.: In this Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Belen A. Salvacion (Salvacion) urges us to annul and set aside the 23 February 2006[2] and 4 August 2006[3] Resolutions[4] of the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, reversing its 11 November 2005 Resolution[5] which affirmed (a) the 7 February 2005 Resolution[6] and 12 May 2005 Order,[7] both of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, finding reasonable ground to charge respondent Leo H. Manlapas (Manlapas), then Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended; and (b) the Information thereafter filed before respondent Sandiganbayan, docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111. Consequently, petitioner Salvacion also seeks in the present Petition the reinstatement of Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division.The antecedents are not complicated.In preparation for her impending retirement on 31 December 2002, petitioner Salvacion, Bookkeeper of the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, prepared all the pertinent documents and clearance for her permanent separation from government service. One such document was an application[8] for the payment of her retirement benefits and terminal leave pay filed on 10 December 2002. Said application was duly acted upon and approved by respondent Manlapas as the Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, and the authorized official to act upon it.On 18 March 2003, petitioner Salvacion submitted to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, for payment, a Disbursement Voucher[9] duly signed and approved for payment by respondent Manlapas, and accompanied by supporting documents, in the amount of P162,291.46 representing her Terminal Leave Pay for 815.226 unused leave credits.In the intervening time, according to petitioner Salvacion, she made numerous follow-ups for the disbursement of her Terminal Leave Pay; to no avail.On 10 September 2003, a few days short of six months from the day she submitted the afore-mentioned Disbursement Voucher and its supporting documents to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, petitioner Salvacion sent, via registered mail, a letter requesting \"the release of fund for payment of my terminal leave pay x x x I will be going to Manila for medical check-up, so that I'm in dire need of money.\"[10] No response was made by respondent Manlapas.On 17 February 2004, petitioner Salvacion filed a sworn Complaint[11] before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, Masbate, charging respondent Manlapas with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f), of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, which state that:SEC. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared unlawful:x x x x(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.(f) Neglecting or refusing, after due demand or request, without sufficient justification to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending before him for the purpose of obtaining directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage, or for purpose of favoring his own interest or giving undue advantage in favor of or discriminating against any other interested party.The Complaint was docketed as I.S. No. 04-17546 (DF).In his Counter-Affidavit,[12] respondent Manlapas denied the charges against him. He averred that \"complainant had been following up the payment of her terminal leave pay as alleged x x x, however, I did not make any promise `to release the payment after a weeks (sic) time,' the truth of the matter being that I really refused immediately (not negligently) to order payment of her Terminal Leave Pay with legal, factual and sufficient justification because upon inquiry from the OIC Municipal Treasurer and contrary to the Certification issued by the previous OIC Municipal Treasurer, Mr. Ismael C. Adoptante in cohort with the complainant, Mrs. Belen A. Salvacion she `is not free from money and/or property responsibilities,' x x x.\"On 19 April 2004, the 4th Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Masbate, Richard R. Riveral, resolved[13] to dismiss the Complaint. The fiscal chose to believe the account of respondent Manlapas that his failure to release petitioner Salvacion's retirement benefits was due to the latter's supposed failure to remit the amount of P7,564.38 to the Municipal Government of Baleno.Aggrieved, petitioner Salvacion filed a Petition for Review before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, where it was docketed as Case No. OMB-L-C-04-1034-K.In a Review Resolution[14] dated 7 February 2005, issued after due proceedings, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon recommended the reversal of the finding of the Provincial Prosecutor, and thereby declared that there was probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable for the violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019. The pertinent portion of said Resolution reads:Records of this case show that complainant had retired from government service on December 31, 2002 and was subsequently issued all the pertinent documents and clearances appurtenant to her claim for payment of her terminal leave amounting to P162,291.46, with the corresponding certification from the OIC Municipal Treasurer, Esmael C. Adoptante that sufficient funds exist to cover for the payment of the same. Ironically and without valid reason, respondent denied payment of the same alleging among others, that complainant had failed to remit some of her collections amounting to P7,564.38 as contained in a new certification issued by the new acting Municipal Treasurer, MR. CEFERINO D. CORTES, JR. on February 23, 2004, a year and two months after complainant's severance from service. The averment by the respondent that he immediately ordered the non-payment of the terminal leave pay of the complainant despite her repeated demands based on an alleged cash shortage as certified to by the new OIC Municipal Treasurer only on February 23, 2004 is a flimsy excuse to cover up for his baseless and malicious act. After all, it was only on February 23, 2004 that an alleged shortage was found out. Hence, it was only on even date that he would have had a valid ground to refuse payment of the same. As the Local Chief Executive, herein respondent should have pursued the legal means to collect the alleged cash shortage allegedly owed by the complainant from the municipality. He could have substantiated his claim by filing a case against the complainant and not place the complainant in a stalemate position as regards the payment of the terminal leave pay of which she is entitled to receive, to her damage and prejudice. The more than a year's delay in the payment of what one had lawfully earned and is rightfully due seem to be a punishment and not a reward for more than two (2) decades of government service, as in this case. Respondent himself admitted that follow-ups on her claim were made by the complainant.Respondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the aforequoted Review Resolution. He argued that his refusal to release petitioner Salvacion's Terminal Leave Pay was essentially prompted by good faith, i.e., to protect the interest of the people of Baleno, Masbate, from being defrauded by petitioner Salvacion. He narrated that on the 7th and 8th of January 2003, petitioner Salvacion usurped the functions of revenue collectors by collecting tax payments from tax payers at Baleno, Masbate, amounting to P7,564.38, and issuing the corresponding Official Receipts, but failing to remit the same to the Office of the Municipal Treasurer. In support of his defense, respondent Manlapas submitted, as newly discovered evidence, photocopies of several Official Receipts dated 7 and 8 January 2003. Further, respondent Manlapas pointed out that the certification issued by the officer-in-charge (OIC) Municipal Treasurer Ismael C. Adoptante (Adoptante) that petitioner Salvacion had no more accountabilities with the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, was invalid, considering that the same was issued at the time when Adoptante had already been relieved of his duties as OIC Municipal Treasurer by virtue of Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated 2 December 2002.Despite the aforementioned arguments, in an Order[15] dated 12 May 2005, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon resolved respondent Manlapas' prayer for reconsideration in the negative. The dispositive portion of said order reads:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby recommended that the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondent be denied for lack of merit. Accordingly, the Review Resolution dated 07 February 2005 which recommended that an Information for violation of Sec. 3(f) of RA 3019 be filed against the latter stands.In affirming the Review Resolution, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon reasoned that:It could not have possibly escaped respondent's attention that complainant has sought the payment of her terminal leave pay considering that he signed the corresponding disbursement voucher certifying that the same is necessary and lawful and even approved its payment amounting to P162,291.46 x x x. Having presented said document for his signature, it should have prompted him to verify first if there is no impediment in the payment of such claim of complainant. And it appears that indeed there was none, otherwise he could not have signed the same. But now, he is now justifying his refusal of not giving complainant her terminal leave pay because the amount of P7,564.38 of her collection is missing. To this, we are not convinced because, aside from the fact that the same is uncorroborated, the purported acts of complainant of usurping the functions of the revenue collectors and misappropriating the amount of P7,564.38 transpired immediately on the month after complainant has retired. If the same is factual, immediate action thereon could have been taken and that it should have been relayed at once to complainant and not after a year. With respect to the supposed newly discovered evidence submitted by respondent, we find that the photocopied receipts issued by the municipality only confirms the fact that certain amounts were collected but not to the fact that it was complainant who collected the same and not remit it to the coffers of the municipality. Finally, with respect to the alleged invalidity of the certification made by Adoptante, it was as early as December 2002 that respondent was apprised of the latter's relief as OIC Municipal Treasurer. As such, he should have called complainant's attention of such fact right away and not raised it at this point in time had he be (sic) sincere in acting on the claim of complainant.On 29 April 2005, bearing the approval of Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio, Special Prosecutor, Office of the Ombudsman, an Information[16] was filed with the Sandiganbayan, and raffled to its Fifth Division, charging respondent Manlapas with having violated Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, with the accusatory portion of the same reading as follows:That on December 31, 2002, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, LEO H. MANLAPAS, a high ranking public officer, being then the Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, while in the performance of his official administrative functions and acting in relation thereto, with grave abuse of authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally fails and refuses without sufficient justification, to order and cause within a reasonable period of time, the payment of the terminal leave pay benefits in the amount of ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE PESOS AND FORTY SIX CENTAVOS (P162,291.46) of BELEN A. SALVACION, a retired municipal employee, after several follow-ups and due demand, the last of which was in September 2003 and requests and thereby discriminating against said BELEN A. SALVACION, to the prejudice of the latter.The Information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division. A Hold Departure Order was issued by the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, directing the Bureau of Immigration to hold the departure of respondent Manlapas and include him in the Bureau's Hold Departure List.[17] Likewise, an Order of Arrest was issued by the same division commanding the arrest of respondent Manlapas.[18]Respondent Manlapas subsequently filed the sufficient bail bond[19] for his provisional liberty which was duly approved by the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), City of Masbate, on 1 June 2005.[20]The arraignment of the accused, respondent Manlapas, was set on 29 July 2005. Before said date, however, respondent Manlapas filed an Omnibus Motion [(1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and (2) To Defer/Suspend Arraignment] on the ground that \"new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced during the preliminary investigation and which, if produced and submitted during the preliminary investigation, would have certainly established the lack of probable cause and, therefore, would have changed the conclusions and findings of the investigating prosecutors.\"[21] He claimed that he was recently informed that as early as 1 September 2003, petitioner Salvacion had already withdrawn her terminal leave application and its supporting documents. In view of said development, petitioner Salvacion's terminal leave pay was not included in the budget appropriation for Calendar Year 2003-2004. He explained that \"[h]aving withdrawn her application for terminal leave benefits as early as 01 September 2003, or MORE THAN five (5) months BEFORE the filing of the complaint-affidavit, complainant had no right to demand for the approval of her terminal leave application from herein accused. In other words, complainant had no cause of action against herein accused at the time of the filing of her complaint for the simple reason that it would have been PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE for herein accused to approve or even act upon a NON-EXISTENT application for terminal leave benefits.\"[22] He then concluded that \"[t]hus, complainant Belen A. Salvacion could not have suffered damage or injury by reason of the non-payment of her terminal leave benefits; and herein accused could not have committed a crime for not approving the payment of said benefits in the absence of any application therefor.\"[23]Petitioner Salvacion opposed the omnibus motion, denying the imputation that she withdrew her Terminal Leave Application. She declared that it was only on 27 January 2004 that she took home her disbursement voucher, after she went to see respondent Manlapas at his office to again plead for the release of her Terminal Leave Pay, and after being told by the Municipal Mayor then that \"since [petitioner Salvacion's] family could not support [respondent Manlapas] in the forthcoming May, 2004 election, [petitioner Salvacion's] request (for payment) could not be granted.\"[24] Further, petitioner Salvacion claimed that the \"accused Leo H. Manlapas further told private complainant that she should just keep her documents and wait for a new mayor to be elected because her Terminal Leave will definitely not be (sic) paid by him.\"[25] Hence, she had no choice but to bring home her voucher \"for fear that it might get lost in the Office of the Mayor.\"[26]The Sandiganbayan subsequently promulgated a Resolution on 11 November 2005 denying for lack of merit respondent Manlapas' Omnibus Motion. The graft court found correct the position of the prosecution that respondent Manlapas was basically asking the Sandiganbayan \"to assess the evidence presented by the parties, and on the basis thereof, make a conclusion as to whether or not there is probable cause to indict the accused for the offense charged x x x. However, as pointed out by the Supreme Court x x x this is not a function which the Court must be called upon to perform as this function pertains exclusively to the public prosecutor. Moreover, the prosecutor's finding of probable cause is entitled to highest respect.\"[27] The fallo of said Resolution provides:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant `Omnibus Motion 1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and 2) to Defer/Suspend Arraignment' is hereby denied for lack of merit. Arraignment of the accused will proceed as previously scheduled on November 11, 2005.[28]Respondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the foregoing Resolution maintaining that \"[s]ince the [petitioner Salvacion] had no right to apply for terminal leave benefits, the accused was under no obligation to process or approve her application.\"[29]On 23 February 2006, the Sandiganbayan reversed itself, thereby dismissing the case against respondent Manlapas. The graft court ruled that:WHEREFORE, finding no probable cause to sustain the present indictment, the present Motion for Reconsideration filed by the accused LEO H. MANLAPAS is hereby granted. The Resolution of this Court promulgated on November 11, 2005 is hereby set aside and the instant case against him is hereby ordered dismissed.The cash bond posted by the accused to obtain his provisional liberty is hereby ordered returned to him subject to the usual auditing and accounting procedures. The Hold Departure Order issued by this Court against the person of the accused on May 10, 2005 is hereby cancelled.[30]The finding that there was no probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for the violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was based on the ratiocination that:In the present case, the prosecution committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that there is probable cause against the accused. There is no sufficient evidence adduced before the Office of the Ombudsman that a violation of Section 3(f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was committed by the accused x x x.x x x xAdmittedly, the elements of the offense are that:a) The offender is a public officer;b) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him;c) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; andd) Such failure to so act is `for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party, or discriminating against another' x x x.x x x xThe second element is absent. There is sufficient justification for the accused in refusing to release the monetary benefits in favor of the private complainant after due demand by the latter. It has been established and even the reviewing prosecutors has (sic) recognized that when Ismael C. Adoptante issued the Certification on December 31, 2002, certifying that Ms. Salvacion is free from money and/or property responsibility, he was no longer authorized to do so. The accused knew this fact at the time of the alleged commission of the crime x x x. In BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002, Atty. Veronica Bombase King, Regional Director of the Bureau of Local Government Finance, immediately designated Ceferino D. Cortes as OIC Municipal Treasurer of Baleno, Masbate, before Mr. Adoptante issued his certification on December 31, 2002, that the private complainant had then no money accountability. Therefore, knowing the lack of authority of Mr. Adoptante to issue the said clearance in favor of private complainant Belen A. Salvacion, accused mayor was justified in refusing to pay the terminal leave pay benefits of Ms. Salvacion.[31]Thus, the Sandiganbayan concluded that:The absence of an essential element of the crime being imputed against the accused cannot sustain a finding of guilt of the accused. Hence, this Court has no option but to desist from inflicting upon the accused mayor the trauma of going through a trial and to dismiss the instant case.[32]Petitioner Salvacion and the People of the Philippines, through the Public Prosecutor, separately moved for the reconsideration of the latest ruling of the Sandiganbayan, but both motions were denied by the said court in a Resolution dated 4 August 2006 which was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006.On 14 March 2006, or within the reglementary period of 15 days within which to file a motion for reconsideration, Petitioner Salvacion filed the same but it was denied in another Resolution dated 3 August 2006 and received by her on 22 August 2006.Hence, this Petition for Certiorari of petitioner Salvacion filed under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court and anchored on the following arguments:I.PUBLIC RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS IN (SIC) JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT ISMAEL ADOPTANTE IS NOT AUTHORIZED AS MUNICIPAL TREASURER AT THE TIME THE MONEY/PROPERTY CLEARANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS SIGNED BY MERELY BASING ON BLGF REGIONAL SPECIAL PERSONNEL ORDER NO. 1-2002 DATED DECEMBER 2, 2002;II.SAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT GROSSLY LOST SIGHT OF THE CONTINUING REFUSAL OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COMPLAINANT OF (SIC) HER TERMINAL LEAVE BENEFITS WHICH AMOUNTED TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION; ANDIII.SAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT HAD UNJUSTIFIABLY AND UNDULY INTERFERED WITH THE FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE MADE BY THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON.[33]Petitioner Salvacion maintains that \"[t]he reliance of Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) on BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order [N]o. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002 to justify the act of the accused constitute therefore as grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction.\"[34] Moreover, she insists that \"the demand to pay the said terminal benefits is a continuing one,\"[35] such that \"from the time the approved disbursement voucher was submitted (to the) respondent Mayor to the time the written demand was given to respondent Mayor and until thereafter, respondent Mayor is, in effect, continuously refusing, without justifiable reason, to release the money claims of petitioner x x x\"[36]; and this fact, according to petitioner Salvacion, \"had escaped the attention of the Honorable Sandiganbayan.\"[37] In conclusion, petition Salvacion declares that \"the Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) had unjustifiably and unduly interfered with the findings of probable cause made by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.\"[38]Without cause to go into the merits of the case at bar, we hereby dismiss this petition.As a consequence of filing this special civil action for certiorari in place of an ordinary appeal under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Salvacion went against the fundamental precepts of procedural law.The Revised Rules of Court specifically provides that an appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Sandiganbayan is by verified petition for review on certiorari and shall raise only questions of law. Specifically, Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dictates that:SECTION 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court. - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.Note that what is being assailed in this original action are the Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 reversing the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, and ordering the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 28111. There is no question that these Resolutions already constitute a final disposition of Criminal Case No. 28111, for after ordering the dismissal of said case, there is nothing more for the graft court to do therein. These Resolutions, therefore, are fit to be subjects of an appeal to this Court via a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45.However, the present Petition is one for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court. Under Rule 65, a party may only avail himself of the special remedy of certiorari under the following circumstances:SECTION 1. Petition for Certiorari. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.The writ of certiorari issues for the correction of errors of jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It cannot be legally used for any other purpose. Its function is only to keep the inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It may issue only when the following requirements are alleged in the petition and established: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Excess of jurisdiction as distinguished from absence of jurisdiction, means that an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, a board or an officer is not authorized, and is invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of the general power in respect of it are wanting. \"Without jurisdiction\" means lack or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority.[39]Contrasting the two remedies, a petition for review is a mode of appeal, while a special civil action for certiorari is an extraordinary process for the correction of errors of jurisdiction. It is basic remedial law that the two remedies are distinct, mutually exclusive, and antithetical. The extraordinary remedy of certiorari is proper if the tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions acted without or in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law. A petition for review, on the other hand, seeks to correct errors of judgment committed by the court, tribunal, or officer. When a court, tribunal, or officer has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the dispute, the decision on all other questions arising from the case is an exercise of that jurisdiction. Consequently, all errors committed in the exercise of said jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment. Under prevailing procedural rules and jurisprudence, errors of judgment are not proper subjects of a special civil action for certiorari. For if every error committed by the trial court or quasi-judicial agency were to be the proper subject of review by certiorari, then trial would never end and the dockets of appellate courts would be clogged beyond measure.[40]Although petitioner Salvacion made general allegations in her Petition for Certiorari that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, a closer scrutiny of her arguments would reveal that she is actually challenging the Resolutions dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 based on purported errors of judgment, and not jurisdiction. It is irrefragable that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties in Criminal Case No. 28111. Petitioner Salvacion utterly failed to convince this Court that the graft court abused its discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions - grave enough to have ousted it of jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 28111 for which she may avail herself of the special remedy of certiorari.It is equally elementary in remedial law that the use of an erroneous mode of appeal is cause for dismissal of the petition for certiorari. A writ of certiorari will not issue where the remedy of appeal is available to an aggrieved party. By its nature, a petition for certiorari lies only where there is \"no appeal,\" and \"no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\"[41] A remedy is considered \"plain, speedy and adequate\" if it will promptly relieve the petitioners from the injurious effects of the judgment and the acts of the lower court or agency.[42] In this case, appeal was not only available but also a speedy and adequate remedy.[43] The availability to petitioner Salvacion of the remedy of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 from the resolutions of the Sandiganbayan effectively foreclosed her right to resort to a petition for certiorari.And while it is true that in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of substantial justice,[44] we have, before,[45] treated a petition for certiorari as a petition for review on certiorari, but only when the former was filed within the reglementary period for filing the latter. Regrettably, this exception is not applicable to the present factual milieu. The present Petition for Certiorari was filed well beyond the reglementary period for filing a petition for review, and without any reason being offered therefor.Pursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:SEC. 2. Time for filing; extension. - The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. x x x.A party litigant wishing to file a petition for review on certiorari must do so within 15 days from receipt of the judgment, final order or resolution sought to be appealed. In this case, the resolution of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006, denying the motions for reconsideration of both petitioner Salvacion and the People, was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006.[46] The instant Petition was filed only on 17 October 2006; thus, at the time of the filing of this Petition, 56 days had already elapsed, way beyond the 15-day period within which to file a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Procedure; and even beyond an extended period of 30 days, the maximum period to be granted by this Court had one been actually sought by petitioner Salvacion. As the facts stand, petitioner Salvacion has already lost the right to appeal via Rule 45.Concomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to at least explain its failure to comply with the rules.[47] Herein, petitioner Salvacion's recourse to this Court is bereft of any explanation, meritorious or otherwise, as to why she failed to properly observe the rules of procedure.Allowing appeals, although filed late in some rare cases, may not be applied to petitioner Salvacion for this rule is, again, qualified by the requirement that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the relaxation of the rules.[48] We cannot find any such exceptional circumstances in this case and neither has petitioner Salvacion endeavored to allude to the existence of any. This being so, another fundamental rule of procedure applies, and that is the doctrine that perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, so that failure to do so renders the questioned decision final and executory and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment, more so, to entertain the appeal.[49]WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED.

SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) AND LEO H. MANLAPAS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nIn this Petition for Certiorari [1] under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Belen A. Salvacion (Salvacion) urges us to annul and set aside the 23 February 2006 [2] and 4 August 2006 [3] Resolutions [4] of the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, reversing its 11 November 2005 Resolution [5] which affirmed (a) the 7 February 2005 Resolution [6] and 12 May 2005 Order, [7] both of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, finding reasonable ground to charge respondent Leo H. Manlapas (Manlapas), then Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended; and (b) the Information thereafter filed before respondent Sandiganbayan, docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111. Consequently, petitioner Salvacion also seeks in the present Petition the reinstatement of Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division.\n\nThe antecedents are not complicated.\n\nIn preparation for her impending retirement on 31 December 2002, petitioner Salvacion, Bookkeeper of the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, prepared all the pertinent documents and clearance for her permanent separation from government service. One such document was an application [8] for the payment of her retirement benefits and terminal leave pay filed on 10 December 2002. Said application was duly acted upon and approved by respondent Manlapas as the Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, and the authorized official to act upon it.\n\nOn 18 March 2003, petitioner Salvacion submitted to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, for payment, a Disbursement Voucher [9] duly signed and approved for payment by respondent Manlapas, and accompanied by supporting documents, in the amount of P162,291.46 representing her Terminal Leave Pay for 815.226 unused leave credits.\n\nIn the intervening time, according to petitioner Salvacion, she made numerous follow-ups for the disbursement of her Terminal Leave Pay; to no avail.\n\nOn 10 September 2003, a few days short of six months from the day she submitted the afore-mentioned Disbursement Voucher and its supporting documents to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, petitioner Salvacion sent, via registered mail, a letter requesting \"the release of fund for payment of my terminal leave pay x x x I will be going to Manila for medical check-up, so that I'm in dire need of money.\" [10] No response was made by respondent Manlapas.\n\nOn 17 February 2004, petitioner Salvacion filed a sworn Complaint [11] before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, Masbate, charging respondent Manlapas with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f), of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, which state that:\nSEC. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared unlawful:\n\nx x x x\n\n(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.\n\n(f) Neglecting or refusing, after due demand or request, without sufficient justification to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending before him for the purpose of obtaining directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage, or for purpose of favoring his own interest or giving undue advantage in favor of or discriminating against any other interested party.\nThe Complaint was docketed as I.S. No. 04-17546 (DF).\n\nIn his Counter-Affidavit, [12] respondent Manlapas denied the charges against him. He averred that \"complainant had been following up the payment of her terminal leave pay as alleged x x x, however, I did not make any promise `to release the payment after a weeks (sic) time,' the truth of the matter being that I really refused immediately (not negligently) to order payment of her Terminal Leave Pay with legal, factual and sufficient justification because upon inquiry from the OIC Municipal Treasurer and contrary to the Certification issued by the previous OIC Municipal Treasurer, Mr. Ismael C. Adoptante in cohort with the complainant, Mrs. Belen A. Salvacion she `is not free from money and/or property responsibilities,' x x x.\"\n\nOn 19 April 2004, the 4 th Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Masbate, Richard R. Riveral, resolved [13] to dismiss the Complaint. The fiscal chose to believe the account of respondent Manlapas that his failure to release petitioner Salvacion's retirement benefits was due to the latter's supposed failure to remit the amount of P7,564.38 to the Municipal Government of Baleno.\n\nAggrieved, petitioner Salvacion filed a Petition for Review before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, where it was docketed as Case No. OMB-L-C-04-1034-K.\n\nIn a Review Resolution [14] dated 7 February 2005, issued after due proceedings, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon recommended the reversal of the finding of the Provincial Prosecutor, and thereby declared that there was probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable for the violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019. The pertinent portion of said Resolution reads:\nRecords of this case show that complainant had retired from government service on December 31, 2002 and was subsequently issued all the pertinent documents and clearances appurtenant to her claim for payment of her terminal leave amounting to P162,291.46, with the corresponding certification from the OIC Municipal Treasurer, Esmael C. Adoptante that sufficient funds exist to cover for the payment of the same. Ironically and without valid reason, respondent denied payment of the same alleging among others, that complainant had failed to remit some of her collections amounting to P7,564.38 as contained in a new certification issued by the new acting Municipal Treasurer, MR. CEFERINO D. CORTES, JR. on February 23, 2004, a year and two months after complainant's severance from service. The averment by the respondent that he immediately ordered the non-payment of the terminal leave pay of the complainant despite her repeated demands based on an alleged cash shortage as certified to by the new OIC Municipal Treasurer only on February 23, 2004 is a flimsy excuse to cover up for his baseless and malicious act. After all, it was only on February 23, 2004 that an alleged shortage was found out. Hence, it was only on even date that he would have had a valid ground to refuse payment of the same. As the Local Chief Executive, herein respondent should have pursued the legal means to collect the alleged cash shortage allegedly owed by the complainant from the municipality. He could have substantiated his claim by filing a case against the complainant and not place the complainant in a stalemate position as regards the payment of the terminal leave pay of which she is entitled to receive, to her damage and prejudice. The more than a year's delay in the payment of what one had lawfully earned and is rightfully due seem to be a punishment and not a reward for more than two (2) decades of government service, as in this case. Respondent himself admitted that follow-ups on her claim were made by the complainant.\nRespondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the aforequoted Review Resolution . He argued that his refusal to release petitioner Salvacion's Terminal Leave Pay was essentially prompted by good faith, i.e. , to protect the interest of the people of Baleno, Masbate, from being defrauded by petitioner Salvacion. He narrated that on the 7 th and 8 th of January 2003, petitioner Salvacion usurped the functions of revenue collectors by collecting tax payments from tax payers at Baleno, Masbate, amounting to P7,564.38, and issuing the corresponding Official Receipts, but failing to remit the same to the Office of the Municipal Treasurer. In support of his defense, respondent Manlapas submitted, as newly discovered evidence, photocopies of several Official Receipts dated 7 and 8 January 2003. Further, respondent Manlapas pointed out that the certification issued by the officer-in-charge (OIC) Municipal Treasurer Ismael C. Adoptante (Adoptante) that petitioner Salvacion had no more accountabilities with the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, was invalid, considering that the same was issued at the time when Adoptante had already been relieved of his duties as OIC Municipal Treasurer by virtue of Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated 2 December 2002.\n\nDespite the aforementioned arguments, in an Order [15] dated 12 May 2005, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon resolved respondent Manlapas' prayer for reconsideration in the negative. The dispositive portion of said order reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby recommended that the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondent be denied for lack of merit. Accordingly, the Review Resolution dated 07 February 2005 which recommended that an Information for violation of Sec. 3(f) of RA 3019 be filed against the latter stands.\nIn affirming the Review Resolution , the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon reasoned that:\nIt could not have possibly escaped respondent's attention that complainant has sought the payment of her terminal leave pay considering that he signed the corresponding disbursement voucher certifying that the same is necessary and lawful and even approved its payment amounting to P162,291.46 x x x. Having presented said document for his signature, it should have prompted him to verify first if there is no impediment in the payment of such claim of complainant. And it appears that indeed there was none, otherwise he could not have signed the same. But now, he is now justifying his refusal of not giving complainant her terminal leave pay because the amount of P7,564.38 of her collection is missing. To this, we are not convinced because, aside from the fact that the same is uncorroborated, the purported acts of complainant of usurping the functions of the revenue collectors and misappropriating the amount of P7,564.38 transpired immediately on the month after complainant has retired. If the same is factual, immediate action thereon could have been taken and that it should have been relayed at once to complainant and not after a year. With respect to the supposed newly discovered evidence submitted by respondent, we find that the photocopied receipts issued by the municipality only confirms the fact that certain amounts were collected but not to the fact that it was complainant who collected the same and not remit it to the coffers of the municipality. Finally, with respect to the alleged invalidity of the certification made by Adoptante, it was as early as December 2002 that respondent was apprised of the latter's relief as OIC Municipal Treasurer. As such, he should have called complainant's attention of such fact right away and not raised it at this point in time had he be (sic) sincere in acting on the claim of complainant.\nOn 29 April 2005, bearing the approval of Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio, Special Prosecutor, Office of the Ombudsman, an Information [16] was filed with the Sandiganbayan, and raffled to its Fifth Division, charging respondent Manlapas with having violated Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, with the accusatory portion of the same reading as follows:\nThat on December 31, 2002, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, LEO H. MANLAPAS, a high ranking public officer, being then the Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, while in the performance of his official administrative functions and acting in relation thereto, with grave abuse of authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally fails and refuses without sufficient justification, to order and cause within a reasonable period of time, the payment of the terminal leave pay benefits in the amount of ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE PESOS AND FORTY SIX CENTAVOS (P162,291.46) of BELEN A. SALVACION, a retired municipal employee, after several follow-ups and due demand, the last of which was in September 2003 and requests and thereby discriminating against said BELEN A. SALVACION, to the prejudice of the latter.\nThe Information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division. A Hold Departure Order was issued by the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, directing the Bureau of Immigration to hold the departure of respondent Manlapas and include him in the Bureau's Hold Departure List. [17] Likewise, an Order of Arrest was issued by the same division commanding the arrest of respondent Manlapas. [18]\n\nRespondent Manlapas subsequently filed the sufficient bail bond [19] for his provisional liberty which was duly approved by the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), City of Masbate, on 1 June 2005. [20]\n\nThe arraignment of the accused, respondent Manlapas, was set on 29 July 2005. Before said date, however, respondent Manlapas filed an Omnibus Motion [(1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and (2) To Defer/Suspend Arraignment] on the ground that \"new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced during the preliminary investigation and which, if produced and submitted during the preliminary investigation, would have certainly established the lack of probable cause and, therefore, would have changed the conclusions and findings of the investigating prosecutors.\" [21] He claimed that he was recently informed that as early as 1 September 2003, petitioner Salvacion had already withdrawn her terminal leave application and its supporting documents. In view of said development, petitioner Salvacion's terminal leave pay was not included in the budget appropriation for Calendar Year 2003-2004. He explained that \"[h]aving withdrawn her application for terminal leave benefits as early as 01 September 2003, or MORE THAN five (5) months BEFORE the filing of the complaint-affidavit, complainant had no right to demand for the approval of her terminal leave application from herein accused. In other words, complainant had no cause of action against herein accused at the time of the filing of her complaint for the simple reason that it would have been PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE for herein accused to approve or even act upon a NON-EXISTENT application for terminal leave benefits.\" [22] He then concluded that \"[t]hus, complainant Belen A. Salvacion could not have suffered damage or injury by reason of the non-payment of her terminal leave benefits; and herein accused could not have committed a crime for not approving the payment of said benefits in the absence of any application therefor.\" [23]\n\nPetitioner Salvacion opposed the omnibus motion, denying the imputation that she withdrew her Terminal Leave Application. She declared that it was only on 27 January 2004 that she took home her disbursement voucher, after she went to see respondent Manlapas at his office to again plead for the release of her Terminal Leave Pay, and after being told by the Municipal Mayor then that \"since [petitioner Salvacion's] family could not support [respondent Manlapas] in the forthcoming May, 2004 election, [petitioner Salvacion's] request (for payment) could not be granted.\" [24] Further, petitioner Salvacion claimed that the \"accused Leo H. Manlapas further told private complainant that she should just keep her documents and wait for a new mayor to be elected because her Terminal Leave will definitely not be (sic) paid by him.\" [25] Hence, she had no choice but to bring home her voucher \"for fear that it might get lost in the Office of the Mayor.\" [26]\n\nThe Sandiganbayan subsequently promulgated a Resolution on 11 November 2005 denying for lack of merit respondent Manlapas' Omnibus Motion. The graft court found correct the position of the prosecution that respondent Manlapas was basically asking the Sandiganbayan \"to assess the evidence presented by the parties, and on the basis thereof, make a conclusion as to whether or not there is probable cause to indict the accused for the offense charged x x x. However, as pointed out by the Supreme Court x x x this is not a function which the Court must be called upon to perform as this function pertains exclusively to the public prosecutor. Moreover, the prosecutor's finding of probable cause is entitled to highest respect.\" [27] The fallo of said Resolution provides:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant `Omnibus Motion 1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and 2) to Defer/Suspend Arraignment' is hereby denied for lack of merit. Arraignment of the accused will proceed as previously scheduled on November 11, 2005. [28]\nRespondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the foregoing Resolution maintaining that \"[s]ince the [petitioner Salvacion] had no right to apply for terminal leave benefits, the accused was under no obligation to process or approve her application.\" [29]\n\nOn 23 February 2006, the Sandiganbayan reversed itself, thereby dismissing the case against respondent Manlapas. The graft court ruled that:\nWHEREFORE, finding no probable cause to sustain the present indictment, the present Motion for Reconsideration filed by the accused LEO H. MANLAPAS is hereby granted. The Resolution of this Court promulgated on November 11, 2005 is hereby set aside and the instant case against him is hereby ordered dismissed.\n\nThe cash bond posted by the accused to obtain his provisional liberty is hereby ordered returned to him subject to the usual auditing and accounting procedures. The Hold Departure Order issued by this Court against the person of the accused on May 10, 2005 is hereby cancelled. [30]\nThe finding that there was no probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for the violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was based on the ratiocination that:\nIn the present case, the prosecution committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that there is probable cause against the accused. There is no sufficient evidence adduced before the Office of the Ombudsman that a violation of Section 3(f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was committed by the accused x x x.\nx x x x\n\nAdmittedly, the elements of the offense are that:\n\na) The offender is a public officer;\n\nb) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him;\n\nc) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; and\n\nd) Such failure to so act is `for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party, or discriminating against another' x x x.\n\nx x x x\nThe second element is absent. There is sufficient justification for the accused in refusing to release the monetary benefits in favor of the private complainant after due demand by the latter. It has been established and even the reviewing prosecutors has (sic) recognized that when Ismael C. Adoptante issued the Certification on December 31, 2002, certifying that Ms. Salvacion is free from money and/or property responsibility, he was no longer authorized to do so. The accused knew this fact at the time of the alleged commission of the crime x x x. In BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002, Atty. Veronica Bombase King, Regional Director of the Bureau of Local Government Finance, immediately designated Ceferino D. Cortes as OIC Municipal Treasurer of Baleno, Masbate, before Mr. Adoptante issued his certification on December 31, 2002, that the private complainant had then no money accountability. Therefore, knowing the lack of authority of Mr. Adoptante to issue the said clearance in favor of private complainant Belen A. Salvacion, accused mayor was justified in refusing to pay the terminal leave pay benefits of Ms. Salvacion. [31]\nThus, the Sandiganbayan concluded that:\nThe absence of an essential element of the crime being imputed against the accused cannot sustain a finding of guilt of the accused. Hence, this Court has no option but to desist from inflicting upon the accused mayor the trauma of going through a trial and to dismiss the instant case. [32]\nPetitioner Salvacion and the People of the Philippines, through the Public Prosecutor, separately moved for the reconsideration of the latest ruling of the Sandiganbayan, but both motions were denied by the said court in a Resolution dated 4 August 2006 which was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006.\n\nOn 14 March 2006, or within the reglementary period of 15 days within which to file a motion for reconsideration, Petitioner Salvacion filed the same but it was denied in another Resolution dated 3 August 2006 and received by her on 22 August 2006.\n\nHence, this Petition for Certiorari of petitioner Salvacion filed under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court and anchored on the following arguments:\nI.\n\nPUBLIC RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS IN (SIC) JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT ISMAEL ADOPTANTE IS NOT AUTHORIZED AS MUNICIPAL TREASURER AT THE TIME THE MONEY/PROPERTY CLEARANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS SIGNED BY MERELY BASING ON BLGF REGIONAL SPECIAL PERSONNEL ORDER NO. 1-2002 DATED DECEMBER 2, 2002;\n\nII.\n\nSAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT GROSSLY LOST SIGHT OF THE CONTINUING REFUSAL OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COMPLAINANT OF (SIC) HER TERMINAL LEAVE BENEFITS WHICH AMOUNTED TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION; AND\n\nIII.\n\nSAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT HAD UNJUSTIFIABLY AND UNDULY INTERFERED WITH THE FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE MADE BY THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON. [33]\nPetitioner Salvacion maintains that \"[t]he reliance of Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) on BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order [N]o. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002 to justify the act of the accused constitute therefore as grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction.\" [34] Moreover, she insists that \"the demand to pay the said terminal benefits is a continuing one,\" [35] such that \"from the time the approved disbursement voucher was submitted (to the) respondent Mayor to the time the written demand was given to respondent Mayor and until thereafter, respondent Mayor is, in effect, continuously refusing, without justifiable reason, to release the money claims of petitioner x x x\" [36] ; and this fact, according to petitioner Salvacion, \"had escaped the attention of the Honorable Sandiganbayan.\" [37] In conclusion, petition Salvacion declares that \"the Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) had unjustifiably and unduly interfered with the findings of probable cause made by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.\" [38]\n\nWithout cause to go into the merits of the case at bar, we hereby dismiss this petition.\n\nAs a consequence of filing this special civil action for certiorari in place of an ordinary appeal under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Salvacion went against the fundamental precepts of procedural law.\n\nThe Revised Rules of Court specifically provides that an appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Sandiganbayan is by verified petition for review on certiorari and shall raise only questions of law. Specifically, Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dictates that:\nSECTION 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court . - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari . The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.\nNote that what is being assailed in this original action are the Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 reversing the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, and ordering the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 28111. There is no question that these Resolutions already constitute a final disposition of Criminal Case No. 28111, for after ordering the dismissal of said case, there is nothing more for the graft court to do therein. These Resolutions, therefore, are fit to be subjects of an appeal to this Court via a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 .\n\nHowever, the present Petition is one for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court. Under Rule 65, a party may only avail himself of the special remedy of certiorari under the following circumstances:\nSECTION 1. Petition for Certiorari. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.\nThe writ of certiorari issues for the correction of errors of jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It cannot be legally used for any other purpose. Its function is only to keep the inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It may issue only when the following requirements are alleged in the petition and established: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Excess of jurisdiction as distinguished from absence of jurisdiction, means that an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, a board or an officer is not authorized, and is invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of the general power in respect of it are wanting. \"Without jurisdiction\" means lack or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority. [39]\n\nContrasting the two remedies, a petition for review is a mode of appeal, while a special civil action for certiorari is an extraordinary process for the correction of errors of jurisdiction. It is basic remedial law that the two remedies are distinct, mutually exclusive, and antithetical. The extraordinary remedy of certiorari is proper if the tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions acted without or in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law. A petition for review, on the other hand, seeks to correct errors of judgment committed by the court, tribunal, or officer. When a court, tribunal, or officer has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the dispute, the decision on all other questions arising from the case is an exercise of that jurisdiction. Consequently, all errors committed in the exercise of said jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment. Under prevailing procedural rules and jurisprudence, errors of judgment are not proper subjects of a special civil action for certiorari . For if every error committed by the trial court or quasi-judicial agency were to be the proper subject of review by certiorari , then trial would never end and the dockets of appellate courts would be clogged beyond measure. [40]\n\nAlthough petitioner Salvacion made general allegations in her Petition for Certiorari that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, a closer scrutiny of her arguments would reveal that she is actually challenging the Resolutions dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 based on purported errors of judgment, and not jurisdiction. It is irrefragable that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties in Criminal Case No. 28111. Petitioner Salvacion utterly failed to convince this Court that the graft court abused its discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions - grave enough to have ousted it of jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 28111 for which she may avail herself of the special remedy of certiorari .\n\nIt is equally elementary in remedial law that the use of an erroneous mode of appeal is cause for dismissal of the petition for certiorari . A writ of certiorari will not issue where the remedy of appeal is available to an aggrieved party. By its nature, a petition for certiorari lies only where there is \"no appeal,\" and \"no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\" [41] A remedy is considered \"plain, speedy and adequate\" if it will promptly relieve the petitioners from the injurious effects of the judgment and the acts of the lower court or agency. [42] In this case, appeal was not only available but also a speedy and adequate remedy. [43] The availability to petitioner Salvacion of the remedy of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 from the resolutions of the Sandiganbayan effectively foreclosed her right to resort to a petition for certiorari .\n\nAnd while it is true that in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of substantial justice, [44] we have, before, [45] treated a petition for certiorari as a petition for review on certiorari , but only when the former was filed within the reglementary period for filing the latter. Regrettably, this exception is not applicable to the present factual milieu. The present Petition for Certiorari was filed well beyond the reglementary period for filing a petition for review, and without any reason being offered therefor.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:\nSEC. 2. Time for filing; extension. - The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. x x x.\nA party litigant wishing to file a petition for review on certiorari must do so within 15 days from receipt of the judgment, final order or resolution sought to be appealed. In this case, the resolution of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006, denying the motions for reconsideration of both petitioner Salvacion and the People, was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006 . [46] The instant Petition was filed only on 17 October 2006 ; thus, at the time of the filing of this Petition, 56 days had already elapsed, way beyond the 15-day period within which to file a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Procedure; and even beyond an extended period of 30 days, the maximum period to be granted by this Court had one been actually sought by petitioner Salvacion. As the facts stand, petitioner Salvacion has already lost the right to appeal via Rule 45.\n\nConcomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to at least explain its failure to comply with the rules. [47] Herein, petitioner Salvacion's recourse to this Court is bereft of any explanation, meritorious or otherwise, as to why she failed to properly observe the rules of procedure.\n\nAllowing appeals, although filed late in some rare cases, may not be applied to petitioner Salvacion for this rule is, again, qualified by the requirement that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the relaxation of the rules. [48] We cannot find any such exceptional circumstances in this case and neither has petitioner Salvacion endeavored to allude to the existence of any. This being so, another fundamental rule of procedure applies, and that is the doctrine that perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, so that failure to do so renders the questioned decision final and executory and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment, more so, to entertain the appeal. [49]\n\nWHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED .

No. 6943, March 13, 2009 ]\n\nATTY. GODOFREDO C. MANIPUD, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FELICIANO M. BAUTISTA,D E C I S I O N\nATTY. GODOFREDO C. MANIPUD, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FELICIANO M. BAUTISTA,\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nOn November 21, 2005, Atty. Godofredo C. Manipud filed a complaint for disbarment against Atty. Feliciano M. Bautista for alleged commission of forum shopping in violation of his attorney's oath and in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and for improper conduct.\n\nComplainant narrated that he was a mortgagee of the property allegedly owned by Jovita de Macasieb.\u00a0 When the mortgagor failed to pay despite demands, he filed an application for extra-judicial foreclosure of the said property with the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court in Dagupan City.\u00a0 Thereafter, a Notice of Extrajudicial Sale was issued and the public auction was scheduled on April 1, 2005.\n\nHowever, on March 22, 2005, Atty. Bautista, as counsel for the mortgagor, filed with the Regional Trial Court a verified complaint for \" Annulment of Real Estate Mortgage and Notice of Extrajudicial Sale with Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order with Damages \" which was docketed as Civil Case No. 2005-0107-D. The case was raffled to Branch 41 which issued a TRO.\u00a0 On May 18, 2005, the trial court issued an order denying the prayer for issuance of preliminary injunction.\n\nThus, upon application of complainant-mortgagee, the sheriff caused another Notice of Extrajudicial Sale.\u00a0 The public auction was scheduled on July 29, 2005.\u00a0 However, on July 20, 2005, Atty. Bautista filed another case for annulment of real estate mortgage which was docketed as Civil Case No. 2005-0253-D.\n\nAccording to complainant, the two complaints for annulment of real estate mortgage filed by respondent contained the same allegations, involved the same parties, the same subject matter, the same facts, the same issues and sought the same relief.\u00a0 Complainant argued that the act of respondent of filing the two complaints constitutes a clear case of forum shopping, an improper conduct which tends to degrade the administration of justice, and a violation of Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which commands all lawyers to uphold at all times the dignity and integrity of the legal profession.\n\nComplainant also alleged that when his counsel filed a Motion to Dismiss the second complaint on the ground of forum shopping, respondent promptly filed a Motion to Withdraw Complaint.\n\nIn his Comment, Atty. Bautista alleged that the filing of the second complaint for annulment of the extrajudicial sale was a desperate attempt on his part to restrain the sale of his client's property; that he is not guilty of forum shopping because he did not act willfully, maliciously and with ill-intent; that he disclosed in the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping of the second complaint the pendency of the first complaint, as well as in paragraphs 18, 20 and 22 of the said second complaint; that he filed the second complaint out of pity for his client who was about to lose her family home due to the unconscionably high monthly interest being charged by complainant; and that his prompt filing of a motion to withdraw the second complaint was indicative of his good faith.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, the case was referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.\u00a0 The IBP then directed the parties to attend a mandatory conference during which the admissions, stipulation of facts and definition of issues, shall be taken up. After the mandatory conference, the parties were heard and thereafter directed to submit their respective position papers.\n\nIn his Position Paper, complainant alleged that herein respondent, Atty. Bautista, is a nephew of Jovita de Macasieb, the registered owner of the mortgaged property.\u00a0 Although the loans which were obtained in 2003 appeared to have been received by Jovita de Macasieb, complainant learned, particularly on October 3, 2006, that Jovita de Macasieb has been dead since October 16, 1968.\n\nComplainant alleged that respondent collaborated with an impostor in filing the two complaints for annulment of extra-judicial sale.\u00a0 Although the plaintiff in said complaints was referred to as JOVITA DE MACASIEB, the complaints however were signed by one JOVITA MACASIEB.\u00a0 Complainant argued that respondent intentionally resorted to this ploy in order to mislead the former.\u00a0 Since respondent was the one who notarized both complaints hence, he should know that JOVITA DE MACASIEB who was his aunt, and JOVITA MACASIEB who signed both complaints, are two different persons.\u00a0 Complainant averred that respondent's act of resurrecting a dead person not once but twice for the purpose of unjustly enriching themselves demonstrates a character not befitting a member of the legal profession.\n\nIn his Reply to complainant's Position Paper, respondent alleged that the only issue for resolution before the IBP is whether he violated the rule on forum shopping; that assuming the IBP could validly take cognizance of other issues, still it was complainant's fault that he transacted with an impostor; and that he did not know the person of Jovita Macasieb until the latter hired his services as lawyer.\n\nIn the Report and Recommendation of Investigating Commissioner Atty. Lolita A. Quisumbing, she found that respondent is not administratively liable for lack of showing that the filing of the second complaint was done deliberately and willfully to commit forum shopping. Thus:\nTo merit disciplinary action, forum shopping must be willful and deliberate. Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court requires that, should there be any pending action or claim before any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency, a complete statement of its status should be given.\n\nIn the present case, respondent explained his actions in this wise:\nIn the second complaint the respondent called the attention of the Court that there was a pending (sic) between the parties, Civil Case No. 2005-178. Hence, the purpose is not to obtain favorable decision, but to have the issue resolved in Civil Case No. 2005-178. To bring home his point, the respondent attached as Annex \"E\" the first complaint.\n\nThe respondent should not be blamed for the institution of the second complaint. He was misled by the very act of the complainant.\u00a0 Complainant had filed the application for foreclosure on December 20, 2004.\u00a0 This was the subject of Civil Case No. 178. All that he had to do was request the sheriff with whom he had filed the application to proceed with the foreclosure. There is absolutely no need for complainant to make a second application.\u00a0 In making the second application, it was impressed upon the mind of the respondent that it was another foreclosure.\nIn sum, respondent acted in good faith in filing the second complaint since it was established that it was his immediate reaction upon finding out that a second application for extrajudicial foreclosure was filed.\u00a0 If, indeed, there was intent to commit forum-shopping, he would not have alleged in the second complaint the fact of filing of the first complaint and attached a copy of the same.\n\nThe objective of the rule against forum-shopping was cited in Municipality of Taguig , et al vs. Court of Appeals .\u00a0 Said the Supreme Court -\nWhat is truly important to consider in determining whether forum shopping exists or not is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues.\nIn this case, no undue vexation was caused to the Court and petitioner as the fact of filing of the first case was alleged in the second complaint and secondly, soon thereafter, inasmuch as both cases were raffled to the same branch, the first case was dismissed by the said Court.\u00a0 Hence, there was no danger of different courts ruling on the same issues.\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, it is respectfully recommended that the Complaint against respondent ATTY. FELICIANO C. BAUTISTA be dismissed for lack of merit. (Citations omitted)\nThe Board of Governors of the IBP adopted and approved the findings and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in a Resolution dated February 6, 2008.\n\nOn June 2, 2008, complainant filed before this Court a Comment on the Resolution of the IBP Board of Governors with Motion for Reinvestigation. He claimed that forum shopping was not the sole issue raised for resolution but also respondent's alleged violation of the Oath of Attorney in relation to the Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility and for improper conduct. He argued that the IBP should have also discussed and resolved respondent's act of allegedly resurrecting Jovita de Macasieb from the dead and for allowing an impostor to impersonate the dead.\n\nThe Court notes that in paragraphs 1-10 of the complaint filed by Atty. Manipud before this Court, he narrated the antecedents which led to the filing of two complaints for annulment of extrajudicial sale by herein respondent. Then, in paragraphs 11-19, complainant concluded that respondent's acts amounted to forum shopping.\u00a0 Clearly, respondent is thus being charged only with commission of forum shopping in violation of his attorney's oath and in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and for improper conduct.\n\nEven assuming to be true complainant's allegation that he only learned on October 3, 2006, that the mortgagor, Jovita de Macasieb, has been dead since 1968, still he failed to raise this issue at the Mandatory Conference before the IBP where the issues were defined.\u00a0 The transcript of stenographic notes taken during the mandatory conference on September 13, 2007, long after complainant allegedly knew of the death of Jovita de Macasieb, shows that respondent's act of allegedly resurrecting Jovita de Macasieb from the dead and for allowing an impostor to impersonate the dead was never raised as an issue, thus:\nATTY. DECANO:\nThe proceeding before this Honorable Commissioner is whether there was a forum shopping.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nYes, the issue so will determine the relevance of that if you have any objection.\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nThere is therefore a relevant because it appears thru a representation...\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nYes, will be noted.\u00a0 State your objection.\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nIt is irrelevant, immaterial and is being of ....\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nYour Honor, I would like to mark as Exhibit \"D\" is the National Statistics Office showing that the plaintiff which was the counsel...respondent is already dead in October 16, 1968 to prove that the first complaint and the second complaint is tainted with fraud, Your Honor, and in violation of this attorney's oath of office.\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nWe object vigorously because that is not an issue before this Honorable Commission.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nThat is why pa\u00f1ero we are here for admissions, stipulation of facts, and definition of issues.\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nYes, but, Your Honor, ...\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nWe have to start first with the admissions and then we can proceed with the stipulations and issues.\u00a0 We can stipulate ultimately on what issue is before this Commission.\u00a0 It is not for the Commission to rule on those matters that you are presenting pa\u00f1ero.\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nBut it will had include this, Your Honor, in order to avoid nor filing of multiplicity of suit because if its that taken in this forum then another case will be filed.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nIt is not the proper forum, pa\u00f1ero.\u00a0 We are only limited on the issues that pertains to the conduct of among selves as a lawyer so we may proceed with the admissions and stipulations of facts and issues.\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nI think the 2 complaints and the Motion to Dismiss are documentary evidence to support forum shopping that I have marked. [1]\n\nx x x x\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nThe other allegations in this proposed stipulation of facts for being immaterial and irrelevant.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nYou're not stipulating that respondent and plaintiff Jovita de Macasieb...\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nBecause this is a new issue and the Supreme Court delegated the Commissioner to subscribe only on the issues.\n\nCOMM.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ANTHONY C. DOMINGO AND GERRY DOMINGO, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.D E C I S I O N VELASCO JR., J.: This is an appeal by Anthony C. Domingo from the January 31, 2007 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00325. The CA affirmed the April 23, 2001 judgment[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 2 in Kalibo, Aklan, which found accused-appellant Anthony Domingo guilty of murder with frustrated murder in Criminal Case No. 5517. Accused-appellant Gerry Domingo has neither been arrested nor arraigned.The FactsAnthony was charged with murder and frustrated murder in an information that reads as follows:That on or about the 18th day of July, 1999, in the evening, in Barangay Cabugao, Municipality of Altavas, Province of Aklan, Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a long firearm, conspiring, confederating and helping each other, with evident premeditation, treachery and with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal gunshot wounds, to wit:The body of the deceased is in a state of rigor mortis. The body is dressed in a hospital gown with the name \"RAFAEL S. TUMBOKON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\" printed in front. The head has a bandage wrapped around the head. The right forearm has a small piece of plaster at the medial side at the level of the wrist.Gunshot wound of entrance, 1 cm. in diameter and 17 cms. Deep, located at the posterior right parietal region of the head, directed anteriorly and to the left.1 pellet, measuring 1 cm. in diameter, flatted and with irregular rough edges, was found at the left frontal region of the brain.as per Postmortem Examination Report issued by Dr. Gliceria A. Sucgang, Rural Health Physician, Altavas, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"A\" and forming an integral part of this Information, which gunshot wounds directly caused the death of said ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, as per Certificate of Death issued by the same physician, likewise attached hereto as Annex \"B\".That on the same incident and with the single act of the above-named accused, another victim, VIVIAN DOMINGO was hit, thereby inflicting upon the latter gunshot wounds, to wit:Left shoulder with metallic foreign bodyLeft arm, lateral and posterior thru and thruLeft hand, 3rd finger proximal 3rd with fracture of proximal phalanxAbdomen, hypogastric area left inferolateral portion with metallic foreign body abdominal wall.as per Medico-Legal report on Physical Injuries issued by Dr. Victor A. Santamaria, Medical Officer IV of the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital, Kalibo, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"G\" and forming an integral part of this Information; the accused having thus performed all the acts of execution which would produce the felony of Murder but did not produce the same for causes other than their own spontaneous desistance, that is, the timely and able medical attendance rendered to the victim which prevented her death.That as a result of the criminal acts of the accused, the heirs of the victim Rosemelyn De Pedro and private offended party Vivian Domingo suffered actual and compensatory damages in the amount of SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P 75,000.00).CONTRARY TO LAW.Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines, September 29, 1999.[3]The other accused, Gerry, went into hiding. Hence, only Anthony was arraigned on November 22, 1999. With the assistance of his counsel, he pleaded not guilty.[4]The plaintiff-appellee, through the Solicitor General, presented its version of the facts as follows: On July 18, 1999, around 8:00 p.m., Nida de Pedro Domingo, her two children, and seven nephews and nieces were at home in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan watching television. Their three dogs suddenly started to bark so Nida asked her niece, Rosemelyn de Pedro, to turn on the electric bulb that hang at the nearby mango tree beside the national road. When Rosemelyn did not budge, Nida herself turned on the lights, opened the bamboo window, and looked out of the window. She saw Anthony and Gerry, her brothers-in-law, standing under the mango tree. Without warning, Anthony and Gerry fired their pugakhang (homemade shotgun), hitting Nida in the right eyebrow. Rosemelyn, who was seated near the door with her back to the window, slumped on the floor with a wound in her head. Nida's daughter, Vivian, who was then combing her hair in front of the mirror, was hit on the left shoulder, left arm, left middle finger, and abdomen. When Vivian cried that she was hit, Nida immediately closed the window and shouted for help. The two accused fled towards Linayasan.[5]Prior to the incident, Nida's older brother, Leopoldo de Pedro, was on his way to Nida's house to fetch his grandchildren. He was about 12 meters away from the house when the dogs barked. He saw the light and heard an explosion which he mistook for thunder until he saw accused-appellants standing near the mango tree and holding a shotgun. Leopoldo ducked behind a pile of soil. He saw the two escaped to Linayasan.[6]Leopoldo, a certain Bobong, and Nonie were the first to respond to Nida's cries for help. Leopoldo testified that after the two accused left, he entered the house of Nida and saw his niece Rosemelyn lying on the floor while Vivian was assisted by other people. The victims were brought to the hospital.[7] Leopoldo, Bobong, and Nonie went to the police station to report the matter while Vivian stayed in the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital for five days. Rosemelyn died due to cerebral hemorrhage.[8]For the defense, Anthony testified that in the afternoon of July 18, 1999, he left his house with his two children and proceeded towards the house of his sister, Teresita Domingo, located in Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan, about half a kilometer away. Anthony's son stayed long at his sister's place as they were still going to Alfredo Dalida, Sr.'s house across the river.[9]In the evening, Alfredo was engaged in a drinking session with his friends in a hut located in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan. Gerry allegedly passed by the hut on his way to the house of his parent-in-law. Gerry refused the group's invitation to join the drinking session. Soon, Gerry's brother, Anthony, arrived at the hut. Alfredo accompanied Anthony to the former's house across the river of Dalipdip. Anthony wanted to talk to Alfredo's wife regarding the medical check-up of Anthony's wife in Manila who was due to arrive the following day. Since Anthony's children fell asleep while watching television, the Dalida spouses invited Anthony to pass the night in their house. Anthony and his children slept in the middle of the house which had no partition. Anthony alleged that he spent the entire night at the Dalida's.The morning after the incident, Anthony learned that Ronnie Domingo alias \"Kana\" was the initial suspect. Anthony denied the charges and alleged that he had never been to the house of Nida since he was charged with killing Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro. Anthony said that he even avoided passing there since the de Pedros had said that they will kill him. He remained in Altavas and continued farming until he was arrested three months after the incident.[10]Ronnie supported Anthony's defense and stated that he was the initial suspect in the shooting incident. He testified that on July 18, 1999, around 4:00 p.m., he was engaged in a drinking session at the store near councilwoman Gloria Marcelino's house. Because of drunkenness, he fell asleep at Gloria's place around 6:00 p.m. Around 7:00 p.m., he was awakened by Nida's shouts that it was \"Kana\" who shot her daughter and her niece. Ronnie was surprised at this accusation. Gloria told Nida not to suspect Ronnie because he was at her house sleeping at that time.[11]On April 23, 2001, the court a quo found Anthony guilty of murder with frustrated murder. The fallo of the decision reads:WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ANTHONY C. DOMINGO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of MURDER WITH FRUSTRATED MURDER, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of death.Further, the Court hereby orders the afore-named accused to pay the legal heirs of the victim ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO the following:P50,000.00 as civil indemnity ex delicto;P50,000.00 as moral damages; andP10,805.00 as actual damages supported with receipts only.Further, the Court hereby orders that the cases against GERRY C. DOMINGO be ARCHIVED until his arrest.With COSTS against Anthony C. Domingo.SO ORDERED.[12]In view of the imposition of the death penalty, the case was forwarded to the CA for review.[13]In the appellant's brief, [14] Anthony reiterated his alibi. He also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses. For one, Nida claimed that the window was open at the time of the shooting which contradicts Vivian's testimony that the window was closed. Also, according to Anthony, the inaction of Gina de Pedro, Nida's niece, during the incident was contrary to human nature. Gina's allegation that there was only one shot also contradicts the prosecution's evidence showing four gunshot wounds on Vivian, two deformed pellets, and one plastic cap recovered from the crime scene. He also contended that since Leopoldo was not among the first to respond to Nida's cries for help, he could not have been at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. Lastly, Anthony attributed ill motive to the prosecution witnesses since they charged him of killing Tenorio, Nida's brother.The Ruling of the CAThe CA found no merit in Anthony's contentions. In reviewing the testimonies of the witnesses, the appellate court found no inconsistencies that would question their credibility. For one, the window was initially closed as testified to by Nida, but she later opened it when Rosemelyn did not follow her order. The CA also held that Gina's inaction when the shot was fired was also understandable since she was in shock. Gina's testimony that there was only one fire does not contradict the physical evidence, since a single bullet of a shotgun can fire several pellets that can cause multiple injuries. As to whether Leopoldo de Pedro was at the crime scene, the CA found that Leopoldo stayed behind a pile of soil for three more minutes after the attack for fear that accused-appellants might see him. The fact that he was not among the first to arrive at Nida's side does not mean that he was not at the crime scene or that he did not witness the attack. The CA also dismissed Anthony's alibi and imputation of ill motive on the prosecution witnesses.With regard to the damages, however, the CA found it appropriate to order the payment of exemplary damages in the amount of PhP 25,000 since treachery was proved. Furthermore, in view of Republic Act No. 9346, the imposition of the death penalty was proscribed. Thus, the trial court's judgment was amended as follows:WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, Branch 2, dated 23 April 2003, in Criminal Case No. 5517 is UPHELD with modification only as to the penalty and award of civil damages. Accordingly, accused-appellant Anthony C. Domingo is hereby sentenced to suffer Reclusion Perpetua in lieu of death and is further ordered to pay the heirs of Rosemelyn De Pedro the amount of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in addition to those awarded by the trial court.[15]Assignment of ErrorsTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE AND SELF-CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION'S ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES.THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.The Court's RulingThe appeal lacks merit.We find no reason to disturb the findings of fact of the trial court. It is an established rule that findings of the trial court on such matters will not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misinterpreted which would otherwise materially affect the disposition of the case.[16] In this case, we do not see any reason to depart from this rule.The trial court gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who positively identified Anthony as the culprit. Nida, Leopoldo, and Gina knew Anthony before the incident and ably recognized him at the time of the shooting. Anthony claims, however, that Nida and Gina could not have seen the attacker since the window was closed as testified by Vivian. Leopoldo could not have also seen the attacker since he was not the first to arrive at Nida's house.We agree with the appellate court that there is no contradiction in the testimonies of Vivian and Nida. Before the shooting, the window was indeed closed, but when Nida heard the dogs barked, Nida opened the window. Nida testified as follows:PROSECUTOR DEL ROSARIO:Q: Mrs. Witness, do you remember where [you were] in the evening of July 18, 1999 at around 8:00 o'clock?A: I was in the house.x x x xQ: What were you doing [in] your house?A: I was watching T.V.Q: Do you have companion in your house?A: My children and some of my nephews and nieces.Q: While you were watching T.V. was there any unusual incident that happened?A: Yes, Sir.Q: Please tell the Court what was that incident?A: Our dog barked.Q: After you heard your dog [barking], what did you do?A: I asked Rosemelyn to switch on the light outside.Q: [Was] Rosemelyn able to switch on the light as you instructed her?A: She did not listen because she continued watching T.V.Q: What did you do after Rosemelyn did not listen to you?A: I was the one [who] stood up to switch on the light and to open the window.Q: After you opened the window and switched the light, were you able to observe anything outside?A: Yes, sir.Q: Please tell the Court what you have observed?A: I saw Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo outside.[17]The Solicitor General also points out that at the time of the shooting, Vivian was facing the mirror and combing her hair. It was Gina and Nida who were near the window. Thus, the latter's testimonies carry more weight than Vivian's. Assuming that such a discrepancy exists, it is trivial and does not warrant the reversal of judgment. In People v. Ave, we held:It is elementary that not all inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony affect their credibility. Inconsistencies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration, their veracity, or the weight of their testimonies. Thus, although there may be inconsistencies on the testimonies of witnesses on minor details, the same do not impair the credibility of the witnesses where there is consistency in relating the principal occurrence and positive identification of the assailants.[18]In this case, Nida firmly stated that she saw accused-appellants fire at her. She testified as follows:ATTY. IBUTNANDE:Q: How long have you noticed the presence of Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo before you heard the gunfire?A: Immediately after I opened the window, I saw them and thereafter I heard a gunfire.Q: So, when they fired the gun you are still standing by the window, that is what you are trying to say?A: The moment they fired and I was hit in my eye, I tried to sit on the chair.[19]We further affirm the lower courts' reliance on the testimony of Leopoldo, specifically, that the latter was at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. He was not among the first to arrive at Nida's house because he hid behind a pile of soil for three minutes after the shooting incident. He testified as follows:ATTY. IBUTNANDE:Q: How long did you duck in that pile of soil before you stood up to go up of the house of your sister Nida Domingo?A: Three (3) minutes, more or less.Q: It took you three minutes, more or less, because you were afraid to show up by that pile of soil because you were afraid that you might be seen by Anthony Domingo and his companion, am I correct?A: Yes, ma'am.[20]Anthony further seeks to discredit Gina by pointing out her unnatural reaction to the shooting, i.e., that she remained standing by the open window during and even after the shooting incident. The 12-year-old girl was simply in shock, as observed by the appellate court. In People v. Muyco, we held:Different people react differently to a given type of situation. There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. One person's spontaneous or unthinking, or even instinctive response to a horrid and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while another person's reaction may be cold indifference. A witness' inability to move, help or even to run away when the incident occurs is not a ground to label his testimony as doubtful and unworthy of belief. There is no prescribed behavior when one is faced with a shocking event.[21]Also, Gina's testimony that she heard only one shot does not contradict the physical evidence of four gunshot wounds and two pellet caps recovered from the crime scene. The CA correctly held that a shotgun can fire a single bullet with several pellets that can cause multiple injuries or deaths.[22]Anthony's alibi, that he was at Alfredo Dalida's house, has no merit. Alibi is the weakest of defenses. To exonerate an accused, one must show that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the offense and that he was so far removed from the crime scene or its immediate vicinity that it could not have been possible for him to have committed the crime.[23] In this case, the trial court found that the house of Alfredo Dalida, Sr. was only 200 meters away from the crime scene. Such short distance makes it physically possible for Anthony to be at the scene of the crime. The Court has patiently reiterated the requisites for alibi to prosper, that is, the accused was not at the locus delictiwhen the offense was committed and it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission.[24] Anthony failed to comply with the time and distance requisites of alibi.Anthony claims that Nida Domingo's initial suspect was Ronnie Domingo. He says that Nida went to the house of Gloria Marcelino after the incident to look for Ronnie. The Solicitor General points out, however, that at the time, Nida herself needed medical treatment for her injuries. Nida's daughter, Vivian, was also wounded and had to be rushed to the hospital. In rebuttal, Nida denied that she ever told Gloria that Ronnie shot Vivian and Rosemelyn. Considering these, we find that Anthony's claim is not worthy of belief.Anthony further imputes ill motive on the prosecution witnesses, claiming that they blame him for the death of Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro; thus, their testimonies are not worthy of belief. It is doctrinal that the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of a witness and his or her testimony is accorded the highest respect because of the court's untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness and, thus, to determine whether he or she is telling the truth. It is also settled that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court.[25] In this case, both courts found that the eyewitnesses are credible. We do not see any reason to disregard such finding. We concur with the trial court's findings:The Court cannot find any well-grounded basis that will indicate that these eyewitnesses were merely actuated by any improper motive.It is utterly preposterous for these relatives of the victims who are crying for justice to merely pretend to have seen the subject heinous event and then concoct a story that will allow the real culprits to remain free just to be able to callously implicate the innocent persons that they hate.Moreover, considering the dangerous trait of accused Anthony C. Domingo and the circumstance that Gerry C. Domingo is still at large, it is highly improbably that they would dare hurl false accusations against them.[26]The Solicitor General also notes that at the time of the incident, there was already a criminal case against Anthony for the death of Tenorio de Pedro; hence, there was no need for the relatives to prosecute him anew if only to get even with him.[27] More significantly, settled is the rule that motive is not essential to conviction when there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprit. Motive is not essential when there are reliable eyewitnesses who fully identified the accused as the perpetrator of the offense,[28] as in the case at bar.With regard to damages, we raise the award of civil indemnity from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000; and moral damages from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000 for the death of Rosemelyn de Pedro, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence. We affirm the trial court's award of PhP 10,805 as actual damages based on the supporting receipts. The trial court held that the aggravating circumstances of treachery and dwelling were present, but failed to award any exemplary damages. While the appellate court was correct in adding exemplary damages, we deem it proper to raise the award from PhP 25,000 to PhP 30,000. Since the death penalty was proscribed by law, the sentence of reclusion perpetua was also correct.WHEREFORE, the CA Decision dated January 31, 2007 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00325 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Anthony C. Domingo is ordered to indemnify the victim's heirs with PhP 75,000 civil indemnity, PhP 75,000 moral damages, and PhP 30,000 exemplary damages.

Accused-appellant Gerry Domingo has neither been arrested nor arraigned.\n\nThe Facts\n\nAnthony was charged with murder and frustrated murder in an information that reads as follows:\n\nThat on or about the 18 th day of July, 1999, in the evening, in Barangay Cabugao, Municipality of Altavas, Province of Aklan, Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a long firearm, conspiring, confederating and helping each other, with evident premeditation, treachery and with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal gunshot wounds, to wit:\n\nThe body of the deceased is in a state of rigor mortis. The body is dressed in a hospital gown with the name \"RAFAEL S. TUMBOKON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\" printed in front. The head has a bandage wrapped around the head. The right forearm has a small piece of plaster at the medial side at the level of the wrist.\n\nGunshot wound of entrance, 1 cm. in diameter and 17 cms. Deep, located at the posterior right parietal region of the head, directed anteriorly and to the left.\n\n1 pellet, measuring 1 cm. in diameter, flatted and with irregular rough edges, was found at the left frontal region of the brain.\n\nas per Postmortem Examination Report issued by Dr. Gliceria A. Sucgang, Rural Health Physician, Altavas, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"A\" and forming an integral part of this Information, which gunshot wounds directly caused the death of said ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, as per Certificate of Death issued by the same physician, likewise attached hereto as Annex \"B\".\n\nThat on the same incident and with the single act of the above-named accused, another victim, VIVIAN DOMINGO was hit, thereby inflicting upon the latter gunshot wounds, to wit:\n\nLeft shoulder with metallic foreign body\n\nLeft arm, lateral and posterior thru and thru\n\nLeft hand, 3 rd finger proximal 3 rd with fracture of proximal phalanx\n\nAbdomen, hypogastric area left inferolateral portion with metallic foreign body abdominal wall.\nas per Medico-Legal report on Physical Injuries issued by Dr. Victor A. Santamaria, Medical Officer IV of the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital, Kalibo, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"G\" and forming an integral part of this Information; the accused having thus performed all the acts of execution which would produce the felony of Murder but did not produce the same for causes other than their own spontaneous desistance, that is, the timely and able medical attendance rendered to the victim which prevented her death.\n\nThat as a result of the criminal acts of the accused, the heirs of the victim Rosemelyn De Pedro and private offended party Vivian Domingo suffered actual and compensatory damages in the amount of SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P 75,000.00).\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nKalibo, Aklan, Philippines, September 29, 1999. [3]\n\nThe other accused, Gerry, went into hiding. Hence, only Anthony was arraigned on November 22, 1999. With the assistance of his counsel, he pleaded not guilty. [4]\n\nThe plaintiff-appellee, through the Solicitor General, presented its version of the facts as follows: On July 18, 1999, around 8:00 p.m., Nida de Pedro Domingo, her two children, and seven nephews and nieces were at home in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan watching television. Their three dogs suddenly started to bark so Nida asked her niece, Rosemelyn de Pedro, to turn on the electric bulb that hang at the nearby mango tree beside the national road. When Rosemelyn did not budge, Nida herself turned on the lights, opened the bamboo window, and looked out of the window. She saw Anthony and Gerry, her brothers-in-law, standing under the mango tree. Without warning, Anthony and Gerry fired their pugakhang (homemade shotgun), hitting Nida in the right eyebrow. Rosemelyn, who was seated near the door with her back to the window, slumped on the floor with a wound in her head. Nida's daughter, Vivian, who was then combing her hair in front of the mirror, was hit on the left shoulder, left arm, left middle finger, and abdomen. When Vivian cried that she was hit, Nida immediately closed the window and shouted for help. The two accused fled towards Linayasan. [5]\n\nPrior to the incident, Nida's older brother, Leopoldo de Pedro, was on his way to Nida's house to fetch his grandchildren. He was about 12 meters away from the house when the dogs barked. He saw the light and heard an explosion which he mistook for thunder until he saw accused-appellants standing near the mango tree and holding a shotgun. Leopoldo ducked behind a pile of soil. He saw the two escaped to Linayasan. [6]\n\nLeopoldo, a certain Bobong, and Nonie were the first to respond to Nida's cries for help. Leopoldo testified that after the two accused left, he entered the house of Nida and saw his niece Rosemelyn lying on the floor while Vivian was assisted by other people. The victims were brought to the hospital. [7] Leopoldo, Bobong, and Nonie went to the police station to report the matter while Vivian stayed in the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital for five days. Rosemelyn died due to cerebral hemorrhage. [8]\n\nFor the defense, Anthony testified that in the afternoon of July 18, 1999, he left his house with his two children and proceeded towards the house of his sister, Teresita Domingo, located in Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan, about half a kilometer away. Anthony's son stayed long at his sister's place as they were still going to Alfredo Dalida, Sr.'s house across the river. [9]\n\nIn the evening, Alfredo was engaged in a drinking session with his friends in a hut located in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan. Gerry allegedly passed by the hut on his way to the house of his parent-in-law. Gerry refused the group's invitation to join the drinking session. Soon, Gerry's brother, Anthony, arrived at the hut. Alfredo accompanied Anthony to the former's house across the river of Dalipdip. Anthony wanted to talk to Alfredo's wife regarding the medical check-up of Anthony's wife in Manila who was due to arrive the following day. Since Anthony's children fell asleep while watching television, the Dalida spouses invited Anthony to pass the night in their house. Anthony and his children slept in the middle of the house which had no partition. Anthony alleged that he spent the entire night at the Dalida's.\n\nThe morning after the incident, Anthony learned that Ronnie Domingo alias \"Kana\" was the initial suspect. Anthony denied the charges and alleged that he had never been to the house of Nida since he was charged with killing Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro. Anthony said that he even avoided passing there since the de Pedros had said that they will kill him. He remained in Altavas and continued farming until he was arrested three months after the incident. [10]\n\nRonnie supported Anthony's defense and stated that he was the initial suspect in the shooting incident. He testified that on July 18, 1999, around 4:00 p.m., he was engaged in a drinking session at the store near councilwoman Gloria Marcelino's house. Because of drunkenness, he fell asleep at Gloria's place around 6:00 p.m. Around 7:00 p.m., he was awakened by Nida's shouts that it was \"Kana\" who shot her daughter and her niece. Ronnie was surprised at this accusation. Gloria told Nida not to suspect Ronnie because he was at her house sleeping at that time. [11]\n\nOn April 23, 2001, the court a quo found Anthony guilty of murder with frustrated murder. The fallo of the decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ANTHONY C. DOMINGO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of MURDER WITH FRUSTRATED MURDER, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of death.\n\nFurther, the Court hereby orders the afore-named accused to pay the legal heirs of the victim ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO the following:\n\nP50,000.00 as civil indemnity ex delicto;\n\nP50,000.00 as moral damages; and\n\nP10,805.00 as actual damages supported with receipts only.\nFurther, the Court hereby orders that the cases against GERRY C. DOMINGO be ARCHIVED until his arrest.\n\nWith COSTS against Anthony C. Domingo.\n\nSO ORDERED. [12]\nIn view of the imposition of the death penalty, the case was forwarded to the CA for review. [13]\n\nIn the appellant's brief, [14] Anthony reiterated his alibi. He also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses. For one, Nida claimed that the window was open at the time of the shooting which contradicts Vivian's testimony that the window was closed. Also, according to Anthony, the inaction of Gina de Pedro, Nida's niece, during the incident was contrary to human nature. Gina's allegation that there was only one shot also contradicts the prosecution's evidence showing four gunshot wounds on Vivian, two deformed pellets, and one plastic cap recovered from the crime scene. He also contended that since Leopoldo was not among the first to respond to Nida's cries for help, he could not have been at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. Lastly, Anthony attributed ill motive to the prosecution witnesses since they charged him of killing Tenorio, Nida's brother.\n\nThe Ruling of the CA\n\nThe CA found no merit in Anthony's contentions. In reviewing the testimonies of the witnesses, the appellate court found no inconsistencies that would question their credibility. For one, the window was initially closed as testified to by Nida, but she later opened it when Rosemelyn did not follow her order. The CA also held that Gina's inaction when the shot was fired was also understandable since she was in shock. Gina's testimony that there was only one fire does not contradict the physical evidence, since a single bullet of a shotgun can fire several pellets that can cause multiple injuries. As to whether Leopoldo de Pedro was at the crime scene, the CA found that Leopoldo stayed behind a pile of soil for three more minutes after the attack for fear that accused-appellants might see him. The fact that he was not among the first to arrive at Nida's side does not mean that he was not at the crime scene or that he did not witness the attack. The CA also dismissed Anthony's alibi and imputation of ill motive on the prosecution witnesses.\n\nWith regard to the damages, however, the CA found it appropriate to order the payment of exemplary damages in the amount of PhP 25,000 since treachery was proved. Furthermore, in view of Republic Act No. 9346, the imposition of the death penalty was proscribed. Thus, the trial court's judgment was amended as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, Branch 2, dated 23 April 2003, in Criminal Case No. 5517 is UPHELD with modification only as to the penalty and award of civil damages. Accordingly, accused-appellant Anthony C. Domingo is hereby sentenced to suffer Reclusion Perpetua in lieu of death and is further ordered to pay the heirs of Rosemelyn De Pedro the amount of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in addition to those awarded by the trial court. [15]\nAssignment of Errors\nTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE AND SELF-CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION'S ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES.\n\nTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe appeal lacks merit.\n\nWe find no reason to disturb the findings of fact of the trial court. It is an established rule that findings of the trial court on such matters will not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misinterpreted which would otherwise materially affect the disposition of the case. [16] In this case, we do not see any reason to depart from this rule.\n\nThe trial court gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who positively identified Anthony as the culprit. Nida, Leopoldo, and Gina knew Anthony before the incident and ably recognized him at the time of the shooting. Anthony claims, however, that Nida and Gina could not have seen the attacker since the window was closed as testified by Vivian. Leopoldo could not have also seen the attacker since he was not the first to arrive at Nida's house.\n\nWe agree with the appellate court that there is no contradiction in the testimonies of Vivian and Nida. Before the shooting, the window was indeed closed, but when Nida heard the dogs barked, Nida opened the window. Nida testified as follows:\n\nPROSECUTOR DEL ROSARIO:\n\nQ: Mrs. Witness, do you remember where [you were] in the evening of July 18, 1999 at around 8:00 o'clock?\nA: I was in the house.\nx x x x\nQ: What were you doing [in] your house?\nA: I was watching T.V.\nQ: Do you have companion in your house?\nA: My children and some of my nephews and nieces.\nQ: While you were watching T.V. was there any unusual incident that happened?\nA: Yes, Sir.\nQ: Please tell the Court what was that incident?\nA: Our dog barked.\nQ: After you heard your dog [barking], what did you do?\nA: I asked Rosemelyn to switch on the light outside.\nQ: [Was] Rosemelyn able to switch on the light as you instructed her?\nA: She did not listen because she continued watching T.V.\nQ: What did you do after Rosemelyn did not listen to you?\nA: I was the one [who] stood up to switch on the light and to open the window.\nQ: After you opened the window and switched the light, were you able to observe anything outside?\nA: Yes, sir.\nQ: Please tell the Court what you have observed?\nA: I saw Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo outside. [17]\nThe Solicitor General also points out that at the time of the shooting, Vivian was facing the mirror and combing her hair. It was Gina and Nida who were near the window. Thus, the latter's testimonies carry more weight than Vivian's. Assuming that such a discrepancy exists, it is trivial and does not warrant the reversal of judgment. In People v. Ave , we held:\n\nIt is elementary that not all inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony affect their credibility. Inconsistencies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration, their veracity, or the weight of their testimonies. Thus, although there may be inconsistencies on the testimonies of witnesses on minor details, the same do not impair the credibility of the witnesses where there is consistency in relating the principal occurrence and positive identification of the assailants. [18]\nIn this case, Nida firmly stated that she saw accused-appellants fire at her. She testified as follows:\n\nATTY. IBUTNANDE:\n\nQ: How long have you noticed the presence of Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo before you heard the gunfire?\n\nA: Immediately after I opened the window, I saw them and thereafter I heard a gunfire.\n\nQ: So, when they fired the gun you are still standing by the window, that is what you are trying to say?\n\nA: The moment they fired and I was hit in my eye, I tried to sit on the chair. [19]\nWe further affirm the lower courts' reliance on the testimony of Leopoldo, specifically, that the latter was at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. He was not among the first to arrive at Nida's house because he hid behind a pile of soil for three minutes after the shooting incident. He testified as follows:\n\nATTY. IBUTNANDE:\n\nQ: How long did you duck in that pile of soil before you stood up to go up of the house of your sister Nida Domingo?\n\nA: Three (3) minutes, more or less.\n\nQ: It took you three minutes, more or less, because you were afraid to show up by that pile of soil because you were afraid that you might be seen by Anthony Domingo and his companion, am I correct?\n\nA: Yes, ma'am. [20]\nAnthony further seeks to discredit Gina by pointing out her unnatural reaction to the shooting, i.e., that she remained standing by the open window during and even after the shooting incident. The 12-year-old girl was simply in shock, as observed by the appellate court. In People v. Muyco , we held:\n\nDifferent people react differently to a given type of situation. There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. One person's spontaneous or unthinking, or even instinctive response to a horrid and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while another person's reaction may be cold indifference. A witness' inability to move, help or even to run away when the incident occurs is not a ground to label his testimony as doubtful and unworthy of belief. There is no prescribed behavior when one is faced with a shocking event. [21]\nAlso, Gina's testimony that she heard only one shot does not contradict the physical evidence of four gunshot wounds and two pellet caps recovered from the crime scene. The CA correctly held that a shotgun can fire a single bullet with several pellets that can cause multiple injuries or deaths. [22]\n\nAnthony's alibi, that he was at Alfredo Dalida's house, has no merit. Alibi is the weakest of defenses. To exonerate an accused, one must show that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the offense and that he was so far removed from the crime scene or its immediate vicinity that it could not have been possible for him to have committed the crime. [23] In this case, the trial court found that the house of Alfredo Dalida, Sr. was only 200 meters away from the crime scene. Such short distance makes it physically possible for Anthony to be at the scene of the crime. The Court has patiently reiterated the requisites for alibi to prosper, that is, the accused was not at the locus delicti when the offense was committed and it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission. [24] Anthony failed to comply with the time and distance requisites of alibi.\n\nAnthony claims that Nida Domingo's initial suspect was Ronnie Domingo. He says that Nida went to the house of Gloria Marcelino after the incident to look for Ronnie. The Solicitor General points out, however, that at the time, Nida herself needed medical treatment for her injuries. Nida's daughter, Vivian, was also wounded and had to be rushed to the hospital. In rebuttal, Nida denied that she ever told Gloria that Ronnie shot Vivian and Rosemelyn. Considering these, we find that Anthony's claim is not worthy of belief.\n\nAnthony further imputes ill motive on the prosecution witnesses, claiming that they blame him for the death of Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro; thus, their testimonies are not worthy of belief. It is doctrinal that the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of a witness and his or her testimony is accorded the highest respect because of the court's untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness and, thus, to determine whether he or she is telling the truth. It is also settled that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court. [25] In this case, both courts found that the eyewitnesses are credible. We do not see any reason to disregard such finding. We concur with the trial court's findings:\n\nThe Court cannot find any well-grounded basis that will indicate that these eyewitnesses were merely actuated by any improper motive.\n\nIt is utterly preposterous for these relatives of the victims who are crying for justice to merely pretend to have seen the subject heinous event and then concoct a story that will allow the real culprits to remain free just to be able to callously implicate the innocent persons that they hate.\n\nMoreover, considering the dangerous trait of accused Anthony C. Domingo and the circumstance that Gerry C. Domingo is still at large, it is highly improbably that they would dare hurl false accusations against them. [26]\nThe Solicitor General also notes that at the time of the incident, there was already a criminal case against Anthony for the death of Tenorio de Pedro; hence, there was no need for the relatives to prosecute him anew if only to get even with him. [27] More significantly, settled is the rule that motive is not essential to conviction when there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprit. Motive is not essential when there are reliable eyewitnesses who fully identified the accused as the perpetrator of the offense, [28] as in the case at bar.\n\nWith regard to damages, we raise the award of civil indemnity from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000; and moral damages from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000 for the death of Rosemelyn de Pedro, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence. We affirm the trial court's award of PhP 10,805 as actual damages based on the supporting receipts. The trial court held that the aggravating circumstances of treachery and dwelling were present, but failed to award any exemplary damages. While the appellate court was correct in adding exemplary damages, we deem it proper to raise the award from PhP 25,000 to PhP 30,000. Since the death penalty was proscribed by law, the sentence of reclusion perpetua was also correct.\n\nWHEREFORE , the CA Decision dated January 31, 2007 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00325 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Anthony C. Domingo is ordered to indemnify the victim's heirs with PhP 75,000 civil indemnity, PhP 75,000 moral damages, and PhP 30,000 exemplary damages.

Orocio, to determine and find out the names and number of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolution(s) No. 2002-124 and 2002-125, and the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory, including the totality of the said amounts for the purpose of determining the 10% charging lien of Attorneys Aldon and Orocio, by summoning and issuing proper subpoenas to the Vice-Pres., Human Resources and to the Senior Department Manager for Finance of the NPC and directing the said responsible NPC officials to make and submit such list and computations under oath;(2) Directing/Ordering the said Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City after and on the basis of the said list and computations submitted by said NPC officials, to issue the corresponding writ of execution; and(3) Directing said Office to undertake any and all actions necessary to implement and execute the decision and resolution in this case thru said writ of execution and, thereafter, to submit a report thereon to this Court.[9]Finding petitioners' Motion for Urgent Execution meritorious, we granted the same per resolution dated 10 December 2008, and issued the following order: The Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation (NPC) to cause the preparation of a list, under oath, of (a) the names of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, and (b) the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory. From the totality of the amounts due to the illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, the same officers are directed to compute the 10% charging lien thereon of Atty. Cornelio P. Aldon (Aldon) and Atty. Victoriano V. Orocio (Orocio) pursuant to the Resolution dated 17 September 2008 of this Court;The Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to pay or cause to be paid immediately the amounts due to the petitioners and all other illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, as well as the amount of charging lien to Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio, in accordance with the list and computations prepared under oath pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof; andThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to respectively submit proof of their compliance of the orders of this Court as stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution.[10]In their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners asked the Court to: (1) cite the Chairman and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC in contempt for their willful failure to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution dated 10 December 2008 which is a mockery of the Court's Order and gross disrespect of its authority; (2) appoint the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, together with his/her deputies, to enforce by execution the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishing/levying upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the responsible NPC officials hereafter to be summoned; (3) immediately summon the concerned and responsible NPC officials, namely: Mr. Eduardo P. Elroy, Vice-President, Human Resources, Mr. Paquito F. Garcia, Sr., Department Manager, Human Resources & Administration and Ms. Wilma V. Ortega, Manager, Compensation and Benefits Management Division (CBMD), Human Resources Department, NPC, to attest jointly and severally under oath as to the existence of a 212-page list[11] containing the names of NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated from the service as a result of the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 with the amounts due to them and the charging lien due Attys. Orocio and Aldon, and to submit under oath jointly and severally the certified true copies thereof to the Court.[12]On 11 February 2009, Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo, through counsel Casan B. Macabanding, filed a Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution. They informed the Court that demand letters have been sent to the National Power Board and to the NPC showing the computations of the amount due each of them. Despite this, no action has been taken thereon. They therefore ask that an order be issued directing the Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon and/or Sheriff of Lanao del Sur, 12th Judicial Region, Marawi City, to seize and attach cash and properties of the NPC and to apply the same to their claim of P16,120,706.00, and to deduct therefrom the attorney's lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio.[13]On 17 February 2009, the NPC asked for additional 30 days to address the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008[14] which petitioners opposed.[15]On 25 February 2009, PSALM filed a Manifestation stating that petitioners did not furnish it a copy of their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 wherein they prayed that the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City be appointed to enforce the Court's Resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. Not being a party in the case, PSALM said it is not bound by the judgment rendered by the Court. It added that PSALM is mandated to privatize the transferred NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and to apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of all existing and outstanding NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. Nothing in the EPIRA[16] allows garnishment and levy of PSALM's assets to satisfy a judgment against NPC. Petitioners are not employees of PSALM but of respondent NPC. PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees for it is not one of those liabilities transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM at the effectivity of the EPIRA. It explains that since the privatization proceeds are earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM, same are not within the reach of any execution and garnishment. The garnishment and/or levying of PSALM's assets and privatization proceeds will amount to diverting them for the purpose originally contemplated by the EPIRA. Such garnishment and/or levy will amount to a disbursement without proper appropriation as required by law. Finally, it argues that the present executory course of action taken by petitioners is a deviation from the Court's Resolution dated 17 September 2008 which leaves the computation of the actual amounts due them and the enforcement of payment thereof to the proper forum in appropriate proceedings for the Court is not a trier of facts.[17]In its Compliance[18] dated 9 March 2009, NPC informed the Court that only the services of its top level employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 contrary to the submissions made by petitioner in its Manifestation and Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009. More specifically, it said only the services of sixteen (16) NPC employees occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager, were terminated on 31 January 2003, but were rehired on 1 February 2003 after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA. It explained that any additional payment of separation pay, backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees would be iniquitous and would constitute unjust enrichment as they were never unemployed.It further stated that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 were nullified because they were signed by alternates. This infirmity, it explained, was rectified and effectively mooted with the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55[19] dated 14 September 2007 which adopted, confirmed and approved the principles and guidelines enunciated in NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It likewise pointed out that the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court.On 13 March 2009, petitioners filed a Counter-Manifestation[20] to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009 stating that a writ of execution may be issued against non-parties, including the PSALM, under, among others, the following situations: (1) one who is privy to the judgment debtor; (2) a successor-in-interest; and (3) under the principle of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. Petitioners explained that PSALM is privy to NPC because the former was principally organized to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and Independent Power Producers (IPP) contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. PSALM, also being a successor-in-interest of NPC, is now the owner of the financial obligations/liabilities of NPC and shall be considered as one with NPC and the liability of the latter shall attach to the former. Further, it said PSALM is a mere alter ego or business conduit of NPC as evidenced by the fact that majority of the members of the NPB also constitutes the majority of the PSALM Board and that the NPB and the PSALM Board have held joint board meetings to resist payment in relation to the 10 December 2008 Resolution. Petitioners disclosed that the NPB and the PSALM Board recently issued a joint letter-instruction to the power consumers of NPC that all payments for power sales shall be directly remitted to PSALM. They further claimed that this letter-instruction violates the EPIRA Law because the payment for power sales to NPC is not enumerated among the funds, assets, contribution and other properties that constitute the property of PSALM, and that these payments constitute gross income revenue and not net profits of NPC. As a garnishee, PSALM need not be summoned or impleaded as a party to the case.On 24 March 2009, petitioners filed their Comment/Manifestation and Urgent Motions (1) To include for Contempt Respondents' Counsels and (2) To Summon the Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration, NPC to Attest and Certify Certain Official Documents.[21] Petitioners point out that respondents, in their compliance, raise two new issues, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125.On the first issue, petitioners explain that respondents' misrepresentation that there were only 16 NPC personnel whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003 is true but is only half-true. They have intentionally suppressed and conveniently omitted in their Compliance to mention and inform the Court of the fact that while under NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003, for various reasons, their actual termination was effected on different dates, as follows: (a) top executives - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. In support thereof, they mentioned NPB Resolution No. 2003-11, NPC Circular No. 2003-09 and the Memorandum dated 26 February 2009 of Dr. Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration (HRA), NPC. They revealed that NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 is one of the resolutions ratified and confirmed by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.As to the second issue, petitioners argue that since NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect, the same cannot be rectified and ratified since only voidable acts can be validated.In our Resolution dated 15 April 2009, the Court, among other things, required NPC to file its Comment on Petitioner's Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. The Court deferred action on petitioners' motion for implementation of the issued writ of execution dated 10 February 2009 pending filing by NPC of the afore-said comments.[22]On 5 May 2009, PSALM filed a Submission to petitioners' Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009.[23] It argued that a writ of execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court. It said it is neither a successor-in-interest nor an alter-ego or business conduit of NPC. Being employees of NPC, PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. It claims that petitioners' claim on the supposed conduct of joint board meetings of NPC and PSALM Boards is purely conjectural and without factual basis. The sending of letters to distribution utilities, like MERALCO, is a consequence of the implementation of the EPIRA as to the ownership by PSALM of all NPC generation assets, IPP Contracts, etc. On the claim that payment for power sales by customers are not one of those under the EPIRA as constituting properties of PSALM and that they constitute gross income and not net profits of NPC, PSALM argues that same is absurd because as owner of the generation assets, it is entitled to the income derived from the sale of electricity. Said income partakes of the nature of fruits which belong to the owner of the asset. Finally, it argued that not being a party in the case or judgment debtor, its properties cannot be garnished.On 27 May 2009, petitioners Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo filed a Manifestation and Motion reiterating their prayer in their Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution motion dated 11 February 2009.[24]On 28 May 2009, respondent NPC filed its Consolidated Comment[25] on Petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009.On PSALM's Manifestation, NPC agreed with PSALM that execution of its properties is improper as it is not a party in the case.On petitioners' Manifestation and Comment, NPC contends that petitioners are either confused or deviously sneaking into the present controversy facts, issues and reliefs that have not been litigated or resolved in the instant case. It argues that it involves the nullification of NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 did not affect the reorganization of the NPC because other resolutions pursuant thereto remain valid. The Court even declared in its 17 September 2008 Resolution that the \"NPC can still pursue its reorganization although it cannot implement the same by terminating petitioners' employment on 31 January 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and 2002-125.\" Under Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, only the services of 16 top level employees were terminated. As admitted by petitioners, the services of other NPC employees were terminated on 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11. The validity of this latter resolution has not been the subject of the present controversy.On 5 June 2009, petitioners filed their Reply to NPC's Consolidated Comment.[26] Petitioners reiterated their Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009 to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. In addition, they explained that the purpose of the EPIRA in creating PSALM is to sell and dispose the assets of NPC and to use the proceeds therefrom to liquidate all the financial obligations and liabilities of the NPC. It quoted Congressman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella's opinion which was in response to a legal opinion of Cyril C. del Callar, former NPC President, as to the function of PSALM. The opinion partly reads: The function of PSALM is limited and akin to that of a liquidator of NPC assets as stated in Section 50 of the EPIRA that the principal purpose of PSALM is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the end in view of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.Petitioners insists it is the NPC and its counsel (Office of the Solicitor General), not them, that are guilty of raising new issues without valid and legal justification. They explained that the Court had settled the following issues: (1) NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect; (2) as a consequence of the declaration of nullity of said resolutions, petitioners have the right to reinstatement or to separation in lieu of reinstatement pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program plus backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits accruing from January 2003 to the date of their reinstatement or payment of separation pay; and (3) 10% charging lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio.All these notwithstanding, NPC raised two new issues in a desperate effort to circumvent, frustrate and delay the final and executory orders of the Court, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated on 31 January 2003; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the purported infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. NPC's raising these issues after the Court's decision and resolution have become final and executory is a clear case of afterthought and act of desperation. Petitioners claim that the NPC had all the time to raise said issues before the decision and resolution became final and executory, but it did not. Thus, it is guilty of estoppel. Petitioners added that the NPC in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration admitted that \"the nullification of National Power Board Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 have far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath. For one, it would entail a financial liability on the part of respondent in the amount of not less than FOUR BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY-THREE PESOS (P4,701,354,073.00), representing the backwages and wage adjustments of employees. (as of October 2006)\" This admission, petitioners contend, belies NPC's claim that only 16 were illegally terminated pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 considering that such amount cannot obviously cover only 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.Moreover, petitioners alleged that the NPC, through its numerous pleadings, made them and the Court believe that pursuant to the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. The issue that only 16 employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 was never raised before the Court's decision and resolution became final and executory. Now, after eight long years, NPC suddenly tells the Court that only 16 employees were terminated as of 31 January 2003. Such behavior shows lack of candor, honesty and fairness to the Court and to petitioners.Petitioners pray that: (1) all the respondents and their counsels be held in contempt of court and punished accordingly until or unless they immediately execute the decision/resolution of the Court; (2) to summon and/or direct Mr. Edmund P. Anguluan, the present Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration of NPC, to fully and strictly comply with paragraph 1 of the 10 December 2008 Resolution - the list should include all personnel who were terminated pursuant to or as a result of the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 regardless of their actual dates of termination; and (3) to appoint and authorize the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City to enforce by execution the Court's 10 December 2008 Resolution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM, based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the aforenamed Vice-President of NPC.The principal question to be resolved is: should the execution of our decision and resolution which have become final and executory on 10 October 2008 be stopped or be prevented because of the new issues raised by NPC? The two new issues are: (1) whether or not our decision affects only 16 employees or all the employees of NPC; and (2) whether or not NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 can be ratified by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55[27] which was issued on 14 September 2007.On the first issue, NPC contends it has complied with the directive of the Supreme Court to list all employees terminated/separated as a result of, or pursuant to, NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It stated that only its top-level employees, numbering sixteen (16), occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the aforesaid resolutions contrary to the position of petitioners that all employees of NPC were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003. NPC added that these 16 employees who were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003 were rehired after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA law. Thus, payment of any backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees are unnecessary and unwarranted.It is unquestionable that when we promulgated our decision on 26 September 2006 and our subsequent resolutions dated 24 January 2007, 17 September 2008 and 10 December 2008, we were referring to all employees of the NPC, not only the 16 top-level employees, as those whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003. This was based on the nullified NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 which reads in part:RESOLVED, FURTHER, That, pursuant to Section 63 of the EPIRA and Rule 33 of the IRR, all NPC personnel shall be legally terminated on January 31, 2003, and shall be entitled to the separation benefits as provided in the Guidelines hereunder adopted.[28]When the instant case was commenced with the filing of the petition, what was sought to be enjoined was the termination of all, not sixteen (16), NPC employees on 31 January 2003 in line with the restructuring of the NPC. All the while, the Court and the parties were on the same wavelength tackling the issue of whether the termination of all NPC employees pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, is valid. In fact, it is NPC's stand that pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. It is only after when our decision and resolution on the matter became final and executory did NPC reveal that not all, but only 16 top-level employees, were terminated on 31 January 2003.We find such action of NPC and its counsel improper. Why only now at this stage of the proceedings? NPC cannot possibly deny that the employees subject of the instant case involves all the personnel/employees of the NPC. As correctly pointed out by petitioners, NPC's statement in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration that the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 has far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath for it would entail a financial liability on its part in the amount of not less than P4,701,354,073.00 proves that what NPC is alluding to is the termination of all the employees of the NPC for the simple reason that said amount cannot be for the backwages, separation pay and other benefits of just 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.Under NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. However, because it was no longer tenable for NPC to complete the legal separation of NPC employees on 31 January 2003, NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003 was issued showing the effectivity of termination of personnel on 28 February 2003. NPC intentionally did not inform the Court that the separation of other employees holding the positions of below Vice-President levels, supervisors and rank-and-file was 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003. Furthermore, under NPC Circular No. 2003-09,[29] the dates of legal termination of all employees were as follows: (a) key officials - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; and (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. To further show that what is covered by the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 are all the NPC employees, petitioners attached a memorandum[30] from Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, HRM, NPC, to NPC President Froilan A. Tampinco explaining the amount of backwages, separation pay and other benefits to be received by the NPC terminated NPC employees.From all these, it is clear that our ruling, pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, covers all employees of the NPC and not only the 16 employees as contended by NPC. However, as regards their right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program, plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits, the same shall be computed from the date of legal termination as stated in NPC Circular No. 2003-09, to wit:a) The legal termination of key officials, i.e., the Corporate Secretary, Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who were appointed under NP Board Resolution No. 2003-12, shall be at the close of office hours of January 31, 2003.b) The legal termination of personnel who availed of the early leavers' scheme shall be on the last day of service in NPC but not beyond January 15, 2003.c) The legal termination of personnel who were no longer employed in NPC after June 26, 2001 shall be the date of actual separation in NPC.d) For all other NPC personnel, their legal termination shall be at the close of office hours/shift schedule of February 28, 2003.[31]but deducting therefrom the amount of separation benefits which they previously received under the null NPB Resolutions.On the second issue, NPC contends that when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55[32] dated 14 September 2007 was issued, the same ratified and confirmed NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. The purported infirmity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 was rectified and effectively mooted. In so doing, all the principles and guidelines enunciated in both resolutions have been adopted, confirmed and approved. In effect, what NPC is saying is that the decision/resolution can no longer be executed since it has corrected the infirmity or mistake that caused the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 by the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.As answer thereto, petitioners argue that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 cannot be ratified because only voidable acts can be ratified. Petitioners contend that both resolutions are void.Petitioners' contention that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void is correct. In our decision of 26 September 2006, the Court was very categorical in declaring that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are VOID and WITHOUT LEGAL EFFECT. The Court has ruled that said resolutions are void for violating Section 48 of the EPIRA Law which requires the persons enumerated therein to personally exercise their judgment and discretion. An illegal act is void and cannot be validated.[33] In the instant case, the approval of both resolutions was an illegal act for it violated the EPIRA Law.What then is the effect of the approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007? The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, supposedly by a majority of the National Power Board as designated by law, that adopted, confirmed and approved the contents of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 will have a prospective effect, not a retroactive effect. The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 cannot ratify and validate NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 as to make the termination of the services of all NPC personnel/employees on 31 January 2003 valid, because said resolutions were void.The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 means that the services of all NPC employees have been legally terminated on this date. All separation pay and other benefits to be received by said employees will be deemed cut on this date. The computation thereof shall, therefore, be from the date of their illegal termination pursuant to NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 as clarified by NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and NPC Resolution No. 2003-09 up to 14 September 2007. Although the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court, same has to be given effect because NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 enjoys the presumption of regularity of official acts. The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty.[34] Thus, until and unless there is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts this presumption, we have no option but to rule that said resolution is valid and effective as of 14 September 2007.We now resolve the issue of whether or not the assets of PSALM can be the subject of execution it being a non-party in this case.In their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners prayed that the decision/resolution of the court be enforced by execution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. In opposition thereto, PSALM stated that not being a party to the case, it is not bound by the decision rendered by the Court. It explained that there is nothing in the EPIRA Law that allows garnishment and/or levy of its assets to satisfy a judgment rendered against NPC. Not being employees of PSALM, the latter states that it cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. PSALM explains that when the EPIRA Law was passed on 26 June 2001, ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets were transferred to it by operation of law. All existing liabilities and outstanding financial obligations of NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instrument of indebtedness were legally transferred and assumed by PSALM. It stressed that the liability of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship is not one of those transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM. The EPIRA, it said, did not contemplate such kind of liability. Further, it claims that its assets and the privatization proceeds cannot be the subject of execution because these were already earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM.Sections 49 and 50 of the EPIRA Law read:SEC. 49. Creation of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. - There is hereby created a government-owned and -controlled corporation to be known as the \"Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation,\" hereinafter referred to as the \"PSALM Corp.,\" which shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. All outstanding obligations of the NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instruments of indebtedness shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp. within one hundred eighty (180) days from the approval of this Act.SEC. 50. Purpose and Objective, Domicile and Term of Existence. - The principal purpose of the PSALM Corp. is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.The PSALM Corp. shall have its principal office and place of business within Metro Manila.The PSALM Corp. shall exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years from the effectivity of this Act, unless otherwise provided by law, and all assets held by it, all moneys and properties belonging to it, and all its liabilities outstanding upon the expiration of its term of existence shall revert to and be assumed by the National Government.Under the EPIRA Law, PSALM shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. PSALM acquired ownership over said properties of NPC via the EPIRA Law. It did not deny such fact and even admitted the same.PSALM argues that the present judgment obligation of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship was neither an existing financial liability nor a contractual liability of NPC at the effectivity of the EPIRA Law. From a reading of said section 49, it appears that only existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets shall be transferred to PSALM. We, however, rule that the word \"existing\" is to be construed as to qualify only the term \"NPC generation assets.\" In arriving at said ruling, Section 49 must be read in conjunction with Section 50. The interpretation of the word \"existing\" should be understood in light of PSALM's purpose and objective during its term of existence (25 years from the effectivity of the law). It would be absurd to interpret the word \"existing\" as referring to the assets and liabilities of NPC only existing at the time when the EPIRA Law took effect (26 June 2001). It is more sensible and equitable that the word \"existing\" applies only to \"NPC generation assets\" because of the intent and purpose of the EPIRA Law which is to privatize NPC generation assets, real estate, and other disposable assets and IPP contracts. Upon the effectivity of the EPIRA Law, most of the assets of NPC, from which it got its income, was transferred to PSALM. When the privatization of NPC's assets is in progress, NPC may still incur liabilities, as what happened in the instant case. Who then shall answer for these liabilities? How can NPC answer for its liabilities if PSALM had already acquired almost all of its assets? It would be, under the circumstances, unfair and unjust if PSALM gets nearly all of NPC's assets but will not pay for liabilities incurred by NPC during this privatization stage. It must be remembered that the restructuring of the NPC was due to the EPIRA Law. It is also the EPIRA Law that authorized PSALM to take ownership of NPC's assets and liabilities. And since the restructuring of NPC, which this Court found to be void, was the cause of NPC's liability, it is but reasonable for PSALM to assume the liabilities of NPC during the privatization of the NPC's assets.It is well settled that courts are not to give a statute a meaning that would lead to absurdities. If the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one meaning, the absurdity of the result of one construction is a strong argument against its adoption, and in favor of such sensible interpretation. We test a law by its result. A law should not be interpreted so as not to cause an injustice. There are laws which are generally valid but may seem arbitrary when applied in a particular case because of its peculiar circumstances. We are not bound to apply them in slavish obedience to their language.[35] The court may consider the spirit and reason of the statute, where a literal meaning would lead to absurdity, contradiction, injustice, or would defeat the clear purpose of the lawmakers.[36] Taking into consideration the legislative intent and applying the rule of reason, we hold that the word \"existing\" should be interpreted to only qualify the term \"NPC generation assets\" and not the word \"liabilities.\"On PSALM's contention that since it was not a party to the case and that the petitioners are not its employees, the properties that it acquired from NPC cannot be levied, is untenable. The issue here is about PSALM's assets that were acquired from NPC. As explained above, PSALM took ownership over most of NPC's assets. There was indeed a transfer of interest over these assets - from NPC to PSALM - by operation of law. These properties may be used to satisfy our judgment. This being the case, petitioners may go after such properties. The fact that PSALM is a non-party to the case will not prevent the levying of the said properties, including their fruits and proceeds. However, PSALM should not be denied due process. The levying of said properties and their fruits/proceeds, if still needed in case NPC's properties are insufficient to satisfy our judgment, is without prejudice to PSALM's participation in said proceedings. Its participation therein is necessary to prevent the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC. Such a proceeding is to be conducted in the proper forum where petitioners may take the appropriate action.Section 19, Rule 3 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure reads:Sec. 19. Transfer of interest. - In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.Under this section, the Court may, upon motion, direct the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. In petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, they prayed that the properties acquired by PSALM from NPC be also levied/garnished. We consider this prayer to be tantamount to a motion to join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case in so far as to the properties, and any income arising therefrom, that PSALM acquired from NPC. It is in this light that we order the Clerk of Court of this division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case. As above-explained, PSALM shall not be denied due process for it can participate in the proper forum by preventing the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC.We now go to the implementation of our decision. Petitioners submitted to this Court a list[37] supposedly containing names of employees separated from the NPC pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 and the respective amounts they will receive. The computation of the benefits due them started on 1 February 2003/1 March 2003 to 30 June 2009. Even if we are to consider said list to be an official document released with authority by the NPC, we unfortunately cannot use the same to determine, at this point, the amounts due each of the affected NPC employees for the simple reason that amounts due should only be from the date of the employees' illegal termination (31 January 2003 for key officials; last day of service in NPC but not beyond 15 January 2003 for early leavers; date of actual separation for personnel no longer employed at the NPC after 26 June 2001; and 28 February 2003 for all other NPC personnel)[38] up to 14 September 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued. This list which should contain the names of all, not only 16, the affected NPC employees shall be submitted by the Chairperson and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to the proper person to execute this judgment within ten (10) days from receipt of this resolution.The instant petition for injunction was filed directly to this Court as mandated by Section 78[39] of the EPIRA Law. In as much as this Court does not have a sheriff of its own to execute our decision, we deem it appropriate, pursuant to Section 6,[40] Rule 135 of the Rules of Court and considering that the principal office of NPC is located in Quezon City, to authorize the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City to execute our judgment which became final and executory on 10 October 2008 and for which an entry of judgment was made on 27 October 2008. After receipt of the list containing the names of the affected NPC employees and benefits due each of them, the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City is directed to forthwith execute our judgment. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court resolves to GRANT petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 by:1. ORDERING the Chairperson and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation, and their respective counsels, to SHOW CAUSE why they should not be held in contempt of court for their willful failure to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution dated 10 December 2008 by claiming that the Court's decision nullifying NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 covered only sixteen employees when it is clear that the Court's decision covered all personnel/employees affected by the restructuring of the NPC;2. ORDERING the Clerk of Court of this Division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case;3. ORDERING the Chairperson and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation to comply with the Court's Resolution dated 10 December 2008. The list shall contain all the names of all, not 16, NPC personnel/employees affected by the restructuring of the NPC. The computation of the amounts due the employees who were terminated and/or separated as a result of, or pursuant to, the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 shall be from their date of illegal termination up to 14 September 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued. Said list shall be submitted to the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City within ten (10) days from receipt of this resolution. They are also ordered to submit to this Court their compliance to said order within thirty (30) days from receipt of this resolution; and4. DIRECTING the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City to cause the immediate execution of our Decision. Said Clerk of Court is further directed to submit to this Court his/her compliance to this directive within thirty (30) days from receipt of this resolution.SO ORDERED.Corona, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.*, Leonardo-De Castro, and Brion**, JJ., concur.* Associate Justice Teresita J.

REINOSO, JR., GREGORY L. DOMINGO AND NIEVES L. OSORIO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nUnder consideration are the following:\nPetitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Motion dated 9 February 2009;\nPower Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation's (PSALM's) Manifestation dated 24 February 2009;\nNational Power Corporation's (NPC's) Compliance dated 9 March 2009;\nPetitioners' Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009;\nPetitioners' Comment/Manifestation and Urgent Motion dated 23 March 2009;\nPSALM's Submission dated 20 April 2009;\nNPC's Consolidated Comment dated 26 May 2009; and\nPetitioners' Reply to NPC's Consolidated Comment dated 5 June 2009.\n\nIn Our decision dated 26 September 2006, we declared void and without legal effect National Power Board (NPB) Resolutions No. 2002-124 [1] and No. 2002-125, [2] both dated 18 November 2002, which directed, inter alia , the termination from the service of all employees of the National Power Corporation (NPC) on 31 January 2003 in line with the restructuring of the NPC, and thereafter enjoined the implementation of said resolutions by granting the petition for injunction. [3]\n\nThe dispositive portion of the decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, National Power Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are hereby declared VOID and WITHOUT LEGAL EFFECT. The Petition for Injunction is hereby GRANTED and respondents are hereby ENJOINED from implementing said NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. [4]\n\nIn a resolution dated 24 January 2007, for lack of merit, we denied with finality the motion for reconsideration of respondent NPC. [5]\n\nIn a resolution dated 17 September 2008, the Court resolved to:\n\n(1) PARTIALLY GRANT the Motion for Clarification and/or Amplification of petitioners by affirming that, as a logical and necessary consequence of our Decision dated 26 September 2006 declaring null and without effect NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 and enjoining the implementation of the same, petitioners have the right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program; plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits accruing from 31 January 2003 to the date of their reinstatement or payment of separation pay; but deducting therefrom the amount of separation benefits which they previously received under the null NPB Resolutions;\n\n(2) PARTIALLY GRANT the Motion for Approval of Charging (Attorney's) Lien of Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio and ORDER the entry in the records of this case of their ten percent (10%) charging lien on the amounts recoverable by petitioners from respondent NPC by virtue of our Decision dated 26 September 2006; and\n\n(3) ORDER that Entry of Judgment be finally made in due course in the case at bar. [6]\n\nIn a letter dated 29 September 2008, Attys. Victoriano V. Orocio (Orocio) and Cornelio P. Aldon (Aldon) requested that Entry of Judgment be made in the instant case and a resolution implementing the same be issued immediately. [7]\n\nOn 27 October 2008, an Entry of Judgment was made in the case stating, among other things, that the judgment herein has become final and executory on 10 October 2008 and has been recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgments. [8]\n\nOn 14 November 2008, petitioners filed an Urgent Motion for Execution. They ask that the motion be granted by:\n\n(1) Directing/Ordering the Office of the Clerk and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City as being the appropriate forum for the computation of the actual amounts due to the petitioners as well as the total amount of the charging lien of Atty. Cornelio P. Aldon and Atty. Victoriano V. Orocio, to determine and find out the names and number of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolution(s) No. 2002-124 and 2002-125, and the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory, including the totality of the said amounts for the purpose of determining the 10% charging lien of Attorneys Aldon and Orocio, by summoning and issuing proper subpoenas to the Vice-Pres., Human Resources and to the Senior Department Manager for Finance of the NPC and directing the said responsible NPC officials to make and submit such list and computations under oath;\n\n(2) Directing/Ordering the said Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City after and on the basis of the said list and computations submitted by said NPC officials, to issue the corresponding writ of execution; and\n\n(3) Directing said Office to undertake any and all actions necessary to implement and execute the decision and resolution in this case thru said writ of execution and, thereafter, to submit a report thereon to this Court. [9]\n\nFinding petitioners' Motion for Urgent Execution meritorious, we granted the same per resolution dated 10 December 2008, and issued the following order:\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation (NPC) to cause the preparation of a list, under oath, of (a) the names of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, and (b) the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory. From the totality of the amounts due to the illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, the same officers are directed to compute the 10% charging lien thereon of Atty. Cornelio P. Aldon (Aldon) and Atty. Victoriano V. Orocio (Orocio) pursuant to the Resolution dated 17 September 2008 of this Court;\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to pay or cause to be paid immediately the amounts due to the petitioners and all other illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, as well as the amount of charging lien to Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio, in accordance with the list and computations prepared under oath pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof; and\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to respectively submit proof of their compliance of the orders of this Court as stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution. [10]\n\nIn their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners asked the Court to: (1) cite the Chairman and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC in contempt for their willful failure to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution dated 10 December 2008 which is a mockery of the Court's Order and gross disrespect of its authority; (2) appoint the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, together with his/her deputies, to enforce by execution the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishing/levying upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the responsible NPC officials hereafter to be summoned; (3) immediately summon the concerned and responsible NPC officials, namely: Mr. Eduardo P. Elroy, Vice-President, Human Resources, Mr. Paquito F. Garcia, Sr., Department Manager, Human Resources & Administration and Ms. Wilma V. Ortega, Manager, Compensation and Benefits Management Division (CBMD), Human Resources Department, NPC, to attest jointly and severally under oath as to the existence of a 212-page list [11] containing the names of NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated from the service as a result of the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 with the amounts due to them and the charging lien due Attys. Orocio and Aldon, and to submit under oath jointly and severally the certified true copies thereof to the Court. [12]\n\nOn 11 February 2009, Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo, through counsel Casan B. Macabanding, filed a Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution. They informed the Court that demand letters have been sent to the National Power Board and to the NPC showing the computations of the amount due each of them. Despite this, no action has been taken thereon. They therefore ask that an order be issued directing the Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon and/or Sheriff of Lanao del Sur, 12 th Judicial Region, Marawi City, to seize and attach cash and properties of the NPC and to apply the same to their claim of P16,120,706.00, and to deduct therefrom the attorney's lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio. [13]\n\nOn 17 February 2009, the NPC asked for additional 30 days to address the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 [14] which petitioners opposed. [15]\n\nOn 25 February 2009, PSALM filed a Manifestation stating that petitioners did not furnish it a copy of their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 wherein they prayed that the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City be appointed to enforce the Court's Resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. Not being a party in the case, PSALM said it is not bound by the judgment rendered by the Court. It added that PSALM is mandated to privatize the transferred NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and to apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of all existing and outstanding NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. Nothing in the EPIRA [16] allows garnishment and levy of PSALM's assets to satisfy a judgment against NPC. Petitioners are not employees of PSALM but of respondent NPC. PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees for it is not one of those liabilities transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM at the effectivity of the EPIRA. It explains that since the privatization proceeds are earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM, same are not within the reach of any execution and garnishment. The garnishment and/or levying of PSALM's assets and privatization proceeds will amount to diverting them for the purpose originally contemplated by the EPIRA. Such garnishment and/or levy will amount to a disbursement without proper appropriation as required by law. Finally, it argues that the present executory course of action taken by petitioners is a deviation from the Court's Resolution dated 17 September 2008 which leaves the computation of the actual amounts due them and the enforcement of payment thereof to the proper forum in appropriate proceedings for the Court is not a trier of facts. [17]\n\nIn its Compliance [18] dated 9 March 2009, NPC informed the Court that only the services of its top level employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 contrary to the submissions made by petitioner in its Manifestation and Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009. More specifically, it said only the services of sixteen (16) NPC employees occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager, were terminated on 31 January 2003, but were rehired on 1 February 2003 after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA. It explained that any additional payment of separation pay, backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees would be iniquitous and would constitute unjust enrichment as they were never unemployed.\n\nIt further stated that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 were nullified because they were signed by alternates. This infirmity, it explained, was rectified and effectively mooted with the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 [19] dated 14 September 2007 which adopted, confirmed and approved the principles and guidelines enunciated in NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It likewise pointed out that the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, petitioners filed a Counter-Manifestation [20] to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009 stating that a writ of execution may be issued against non-parties, including the PSALM, under, among others, the following situations: (1) one who is privy to the judgment debtor; (2) a successor-in-interest; and (3) under the principle of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. Petitioners explained that PSALM is privy to NPC because the former was principally organized to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and Independent Power Producers (IPP) contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. PSALM, also being a successor-in-interest of NPC, is now the owner of the financial obligations/liabilities of NPC and shall be considered as one with NPC and the liability of the latter shall attach to the former. Further, it said PSALM is a mere alter ego or business conduit of NPC as evidenced by the fact that majority of the members of the NPB also constitutes the majority of the PSALM Board and that the NPB and the PSALM Board have held joint board meetings to resist payment in relation to the 10 December 2008 Resolution. Petitioners disclosed that the NPB and the PSALM Board recently issued a joint letter-instruction to the power consumers of NPC that all payments for power sales shall be directly remitted to PSALM. They further claimed that this letter-instruction violates the EPIRA Law because the payment for power sales to NPC is not enumerated among the funds, assets, contribution and other properties that constitute the property of PSALM, and that these payments constitute gross income revenue and not net profits of NPC. As a garnishee, PSALM need not be summoned or impleaded as a party to the case.\n\nOn 24 March 2009, petitioners filed their Comment/Manifestation and Urgent Motions (1) To include for Contempt Respondents' Counsels and (2) To Summon the Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration, NPC to Attest and Certify Certain Official Documents. [21] Petitioners point out that respondents, in their compliance, raise two new issues, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125.\n\nOn the first issue, petitioners explain that respondents' misrepresentation that there were only 16 NPC personnel whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003 is true but is only half-true. They have intentionally suppressed and conveniently omitted in their Compliance to mention and inform the Court of the fact that while under NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003, for various reasons, their actual termination was effected on different dates, as follows: (a) top executives - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. In support thereof, they mentioned NPB Resolution No. 2003-11, NPC Circular No. 2003-09 and the Memorandum dated 26 February 2009 of Dr. Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration (HRA), NPC. They revealed that NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 is one of the resolutions ratified and confirmed by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.\n\nAs to the second issue, petitioners argue that since NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect, the same cannot be rectified and ratified since only voidable acts can be validated.\n\nIn our Resolution dated 15 April 2009, the Court, among other things, required NPC to file its Comment on Petitioner's Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. The Court deferred action on petitioners' motion for implementation of the issued writ of execution dated 10 February 2009 pending filing by NPC of the afore-said comments. [22]\n\nOn 5 May 2009, PSALM filed a Submission to petitioners' Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009. [23] It argued that a writ of execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court. It said it is neither a successor-in-interest nor an alter-ego or business conduit of NPC. Being employees of NPC, PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. It claims that petitioners' claim on the supposed conduct of joint board meetings of NPC and PSALM Boards is purely conjectural and without factual basis. The sending of letters to distribution utilities, like MERALCO, is a consequence of the implementation of the EPIRA as to the ownership by PSALM of all NPC generation assets, IPP Contracts, etc . On the claim that payment for power sales by customers are not one of those under the EPIRA as constituting properties of PSALM and that they constitute gross income and not net profits of NPC, PSALM argues that same is absurd because as owner of the generation assets, it is entitled to the income derived from the sale of electricity. Said income partakes of the nature of fruits which belong to the owner of the asset. Finally, it argued that not being a party in the case or judgment debtor, its properties cannot be garnished.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, petitioners Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo filed a Manifestation and Motion reiterating their prayer in their Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution motion dated 11 February 2009. [24]\n\nOn 28 May 2009, respondent NPC filed its Consolidated Comment [25] on Petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009.\n\nOn PSALM's Manifestation, NPC agreed with PSALM that execution of its properties is improper as it is not a party in the case.\n\nOn petitioners' Manifestation and Comment, NPC contends that petitioners are either confused or deviously sneaking into the present controversy facts, issues and reliefs that have not been litigated or resolved in the instant case. It argues that it involves the nullification of NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 did not affect the reorganization of the NPC because other resolutions pursuant thereto remain valid. The Court even declared in its 17 September 2008 Resolution that the \" NPC can still pursue its reorganization although it cannot implement the same by terminating petitioners' employment on 31 January 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and 2002-125. \" Under Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, only the services of 16 top level employees were terminated. As admitted by petitioners, the services of other NPC employees were terminated on 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11. The validity of this latter resolution has not been the subject of the present controversy.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, petitioners filed their Reply to NPC's Consolidated Comment. [26] Petitioners reiterated their Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009 to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. In addition, they explained that the purpose of the EPIRA in creating PSALM is to sell and dispose the assets of NPC and to use the proceeds therefrom to liquidate all the financial obligations and liabilities of the NPC. It quoted Congressman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella's opinion which was in response to a legal opinion of Cyril C. del Callar, former NPC President, as to the function of PSALM. The opinion partly reads: The function of PSALM is limited and akin to that of a liquidator of NPC assets as stated in Section 50 of the EPIRA that the principal purpose of PSALM is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the end in view of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.\n\nPetitioners insists it is the NPC and its counsel (Office of the Solicitor General), not them, that are guilty of raising new issues without valid and legal justification. They explained that the Court had settled the following issues: (1) NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect; (2) as a consequence of the declaration of nullity of said resolutions, petitioners have the right to reinstatement or to separation in lieu of reinstatement pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program plus backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits accruing from January 2003 to the date of their reinstatement or payment of separation pay; and (3) 10% charging lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio.\n\nAll these notwithstanding, NPC raised two new issues in a desperate effort to circumvent, frustrate and delay the final and executory orders of the Court, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated on 31 January 2003; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the purported infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. NPC's raising these issues after the Court's decision and resolution have become final and executory is a clear case of afterthought and act of desperation. Petitioners claim that the NPC had all the time to raise said issues before the decision and resolution became final and executory, but it did not. Thus, it is guilty of estoppel. Petitioners added that the NPC in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration admitted that \"the nullification of National Power Board Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 have far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath. For one, it would entail a financial liability on the part of respondent in the amount of not less than FOUR BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY-THREE PESOS (P4,701,354,073.00), representing the backwages and wage adjustments of employees. (as of October 2006)\" This admission, petitioners contend, belies NPC's claim that only 16 were illegally terminated pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 considering that such amount cannot obviously cover only 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.\n\nMoreover, petitioners alleged that the NPC, through its numerous pleadings, made them and the Court believe that pursuant to the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. The issue that only 16 employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 was never raised before the Court's decision and resolution became final and executory. Now, after eight long years, NPC suddenly tells the Court that only 16 employees were terminated as of 31 January 2003. Such behavior shows lack of candor, honesty and fairness to the Court and to petitioners.\n\nPetitioners pray that: (1) all the respondents and their counsels be held in contempt of court and punished accordingly until or unless they immediately execute the decision/resolution of the Court; (2) to summon and/or direct Mr. Edmund P. Anguluan, the present Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration of NPC, to fully and strictly comply with paragraph 1 of the 10 December 2008 Resolution - the list should include all personnel who were terminated pursuant to or as a result of the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 regardless of their actual dates of termination; and (3) to appoint and authorize the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City to enforce by execution the Court's 10 December 2008 Resolution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM, based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the aforenamed Vice-President of NPC.\n\nThe principal question to be resolved is: should the execution of our decision and resolution which have become final and executory on 10 October 2008 be stopped or be prevented because of the new issues raised by NPC? The two new issues are: (1) whether or not our decision affects only 16 employees or all the employees of NPC; and (2) whether or not NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 can be ratified by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 [27] which was issued on 14 September 2007.\n\nOn the first issue, NPC contends it has complied with the directive of the Supreme Court to list all employees terminated/separated as a result of, or pursuant to, NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It stated that only its top-level employees, numbering sixteen (16), occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the aforesaid resolutions contrary to the position of petitioners that all employees of NPC were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003. NPC added that these 16 employees who were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003 were rehired after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA law. Thus, payment of any backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees are unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nIt is unquestionable that when we promulgated our decision on 26 September 2006 and our subsequent resolutions dated 24 January 2007, 17 September 2008 and 10 December 2008, we were referring to all employees of the NPC, not only the 16 top-level employees, as those whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003. This was based on the nullified NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 which reads in part:\n\nRESOLVED, FURTHER, That, pursuant to Section 63 of the EPIRA and Rule 33 of the IRR, all NPC personnel shall be legally terminated on January 31, 2003 , and shall be entitled to the separation benefits as provided in the Guidelines hereunder adopted. [28]\nWhen the instant case was commenced with the filing of the petition, what was sought to be enjoined was the termination of all, not sixteen (16), NPC employees on 31 January 2003 in line with the restructuring of the NPC. All the while, the Court and the parties were on the same wavelength tackling the issue of whether the termination of all NPC employees pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, is valid. In fact, it is NPC's stand that pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. It is only after when our decision and resolution on the matter became final and executory did NPC reveal that not all, but only 16 top-level employees, were terminated on 31 January 2003.\n\nWe find such action of NPC and its counsel improper. Why only now at this stage of the proceedings? NPC cannot possibly deny that the employees subject of the instant case involves all the personnel/employees of the NPC. As correctly pointed out by petitioners, NPC's statement in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration that the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 has far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath for it would entail a financial liability on its part in the amount of not less than P4,701,354,073.00 proves that what NPC is alluding to is the termination of all the employees of the NPC for the simple reason that said amount cannot be for the backwages, separation pay and other benefits of just 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.\n\nUnder NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. However, because it was no longer tenable for NPC to complete the legal separation of NPC employees on 31 January 2003, NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003 was issued showing the effectivity of termination of personnel on 28 February 2003. NPC intentionally did not inform the Court that the separation of other employees holding the positions of below Vice-President levels, supervisors and rank-and-file was 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003. Furthermore, under NPC Circular No. 2003-09, [29] the dates of legal termination of all employees were as follows: (a) key officials - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; and (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. To further show that what is covered by the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 are all the NPC employees, petitioners attached a memorandum [30] from Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, HRM, NPC, to NPC President Froilan A. Tampinco explaining the amount of backwages, separation pay and other benefits to be received by the NPC terminated NPC employees.\n\nFrom all these, it is clear that our ruling, pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, covers all employees of the NPC and not only the 16 employees as contended by NPC. However, as regards their right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program, plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits, the same shall be computed from the date of legal termination as stated in NPC Circular No. 2003-09, to wit:\n\na) The legal termination of key officials , i.e. , the Corporate Secretary, Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who were appointed under NP Board Resolution No. 2003-12, shall be at the close of office hours of January 31, 2003 .\n\nb) The legal termination of personnel who availed of the early leavers' scheme shall be on the last day of service in NPC but not beyond January 15, 2003 .\n\nc) The legal termination of personnel who were no longer employed in NPC after June 26, 2001 shall be the date of actual separation in NPC.\n\nd) For all other NPC personnel , their legal termination shall be at the close of office hours/shift schedule of February 28, 2003 . [31]\nbut deducting therefrom the amount of separation benefits which they previously received under the null NPB Resolutions.\n\nOn the second issue, NPC contends that when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 [32] dated 14 September 2007 was issued, the same ratified and confirmed NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. The purported infirmity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 was rectified and effectively mooted. In so doing, all the principles and guidelines enunciated in both resolutions have been adopted, confirmed and approved. In effect, what NPC is saying is that the decision/resolution can no longer be executed since it has corrected the infirmity or mistake that caused the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 by the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.\n\nAs answer thereto, petitioners argue that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 cannot be ratified because only voidable acts can be ratified. Petitioners contend that both resolutions are void.\n\nPetitioners' contention that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void is correct. In our decision of 26 September 2006, the Court was very categorical in declaring that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are VOID and WITHOUT LEGAL EFFECT. The Court has ruled that said resolutions are void for violating Section 48 of the EPIRA Law which requires the persons enumerated therein to personally exercise their judgment and discretion. An illegal act is void and cannot be validated. [33] In the instant case, the approval of both resolutions was an illegal act for it violated the EPIRA Law.\n\nWhat then is the effect of the approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007? The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, supposedly by a majority of the National Power Board as designated by law, that adopted, confirmed and approved the contents of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 will have a prospective effect , not a retroactive effect. The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 cannot ratify and validate NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 as to make the termination of the services of all NPC personnel/employees on 31 January 2003 valid, because said resolutions were void.\n\nThe approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 means that the services of all NPC employees have been legally terminated on this date. All separation pay and other benefits to be received by said employees will be deemed cut on this date. The computation thereof shall, therefore, be from the date of their illegal termination pursuant to NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 as clarified by NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and NPC Resolution No. 2003-09 up to 14 September 2007. Although the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court, same has to be given effect because NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 enjoys the presumption of regularity of official acts. The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty. [34] Thus, until and unless there is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts this presumption, we have no option but to rule that said resolution is valid and effective as of 14 September 2007.\n\nWe now resolve the issue of whether or not the assets of PSALM can be the subject of execution it being a non-party in this case.\n\nIn their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners prayed that the decision/resolution of the court be enforced by execution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. In opposition thereto, PSALM stated that not being a party to the case, it is not bound by the decision rendered by the Court. It explained that there is nothing in the EPIRA Law that allows garnishment and/or levy of its assets to satisfy a judgment rendered against NPC. Not being employees of PSALM, the latter states that it cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. PSALM explains that when the EPIRA Law was passed on 26 June 2001, ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets were transferred to it by operation of law. All existing liabilities and outstanding financial obligations of NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instrument of indebtedness were legally transferred and assumed by PSALM. It stressed that the liability of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship is not one of those transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM. The EPIRA, it said, did not contemplate such kind of liability. Further, it claims that its assets and the privatization proceeds cannot be the subject of execution because these were already earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM.\n\nSections 49 and 50 of the EPIRA Law read:\n\nSEC. 49. Creation of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. - There is hereby created a government-owned and -controlled corporation to be known as the \"Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation,\" hereinafter referred to as the \"PSALM Corp.,\" which shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. All outstanding obligations of the NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instruments of indebtedness shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp. within one hundred eighty (180) days from the approval of this Act.\n\nSEC. 50. Purpose and Objective, Domicile and Term of Existence. - The principal purpose of the PSALM Corp. is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.\n\nThe PSALM Corp. shall have its principal office and place of business within Metro Manila.\n\nThe PSALM Corp. shall exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years from the effectivity of this Act, unless otherwise provided by law, and all assets held by it, all moneys and properties belonging to it, and all its liabilities outstanding upon the expiration of its term of existence shall revert to and be assumed by the National Government.\nUnder the EPIRA Law, PSALM shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. PSALM acquired ownership over said properties of NPC via the EPIRA Law. It did not deny such fact and even admitted the same.\n\nPSALM argues that the present judgment obligation of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship was neither an existing financial liability nor a contractual liability of NPC at the effectivity of the EPIRA Law. From a reading of said section 49, it appears that only existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets shall be transferred to PSALM. We, however, rule that the word \"existing\" is to be construed as to qualify only the term \"NPC generation assets.\" In arriving at said ruling, Section 49 must be read in conjunction with Section 50. The interpretation of the word \"existing\" should be understood in light of PSALM's purpose and objective during its term of existence (25 years from the effectivity of the law). It would be absurd to interpret the word \"existing\" as referring to the assets and liabilities of NPC only existing at the time when the EPIRA Law took effect (26 June 2001). It is more sensible and equitable that the word \"existing\" applies only to \"NPC generation assets\" because of the intent and purpose of the EPIRA Law which is to privatize NPC generation assets, real estate, and other disposable assets and IPP contracts. Upon the effectivity of the EPIRA Law, most of the assets of NPC, from which it got its income, was transferred to PSALM. When the privatization of NPC's assets is in progress, NPC may still incur liabilities, as what happened in the instant case. Who then shall answer for these liabilities? How can NPC answer for its liabilities if PSALM had already acquired almost all of its assets? It would be, under the circumstances, unfair and unjust if PSALM gets nearly all of NPC's assets but will not pay for liabilities incurred by NPC during this privatization stage. It must be remembered that the restructuring of the NPC was due to the EPIRA Law. It is also the EPIRA Law that authorized PSALM to take ownership of NPC's assets and liabilities. And since the restructuring of NPC, which this Court found to be void, was the cause of NPC's liability, it is but reasonable for PSALM to assume the liabilities of NPC during the privatization of the NPC's assets.\n\nIt is well settled that courts are not to give a statute a meaning that would lead to absurdities. If the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one meaning, the absurdity of the result of one construction is a strong argument against its adoption, and in favor of such sensible interpretation. We test a law by its result. A law should not be interpreted so as not to cause an injustice. There are laws which are generally valid but may seem arbitrary when applied in a particular case because of its peculiar circumstances. We are not bound to apply them in slavish obedience to their language. [35] The court may consider the spirit and reason of the statute, where a literal meaning would lead to absurdity, contradiction, injustice, or would defeat the clear purpose of the lawmakers. [36] Taking into consideration the legislative intent and applying the rule of reason, we hold that the word \"existing\" should be interpreted to only qualify the term \"NPC generation assets\" and not the word \"liabilities.\"\n\nOn PSALM's contention that since it was not a party to the case and that the petitioners are not its employees, the properties that it acquired from NPC cannot be levied, is untenable. The issue here is about PSALM's assets that were acquired from NPC. As explained above, PSALM took ownership over most of NPC's assets. There was indeed a transfer of interest over these assets - from NPC to PSALM - by operation of law. These properties may be used to satisfy our judgment. This being the case, petitioners may go after such properties. The fact that PSALM is a non-party to the case will not prevent the levying of the said properties, including their fruits and proceeds. However, PSALM should not be denied due process. The levying of said properties and their fruits/proceeds, if still needed in case NPC's properties are insufficient to satisfy our judgment, is without prejudice to PSALM's participation in said proceedings. Its participation therein is necessary to prevent the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC. Such a proceeding is to be conducted in the proper forum where petitioners may take the appropriate action.\n\nSection 19, Rule 3 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure reads:\n\nSec. 19. Transfer of interest . - In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.\n\nUnder this section, the Court may, upon motion, direct the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. In petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, they prayed that the properties acquired by PSALM from NPC be also levied/garnished. We consider this prayer to be tantamount to a motion to join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case in so far as to the properties, and any income arising therefrom, that PSALM acquired from NPC. It is in this light that we order the Clerk of Court of this division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case. As above-explained, PSALM shall not be denied due process for it can participate in the proper forum by preventing the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC.\n\nWe now go to the implementation of our decision. Petitioners submitted to this Court a list [37] supposedly containing names of employees separated from the NPC pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 and the respective amounts they will receive. The computation of the benefits due them started on 1 February 2003/1 March 2003 to 30 June 2009. Even if we are to consider said list to be an official document released with authority by the NPC, we unfortunately cannot use the same to determine, at this point, the amounts due each of the affected NPC employees for the simple reason that amounts due should only be from the date of the employees' illegal termination (31 January 2003 for key officials; last day of service in NPC but not beyond 15 January 2003 for early leavers; date of actual separation for personnel no longer employed at the NPC after 26 June 2001; and 28 February 2003 for all other NPC personnel) [38] up to 14 September 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued.

No. P-96-1182, July 19, 2000 ]\n\nJOSEFINA MARQUEZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. AIDA CLORES-RAMOS, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N\nJOSEFINA MARQUEZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. AIDA CLORES-RAMOS, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nKAPUNAN, J.:\n\nIn a sworn letter complaint dated October 10, 1995, Mrs. Josefina A. Marquez charged respondent, Ms. Aida Clores-Ramos, Court Stenographer III, OCC-RTC, Branch 29, Libmanan, Camarines Sur with unethical, illicit and highly immoral acts.\n\nComplainant alleged, among others, that she is the legal wife of Mr. Florencio Marquez, Sr.; that they were married on January 5, 1955 before the Roman Catholic Church of Libmanan; and that respondent is maintaining an amorous illicit relationship with her husband, out of which a baby boy was born on December 8, 1993 and baptized as Florencio Marquez, Jr. on February 11, 1994 at the St. James the Apostle Parish, Libmanan, Camarines Sur.\n\nAttached to her complaint are handwritten letters of her husband to respondent to prove her husband's extra-marital affairs with respondent Court Stenographer.\n\nMeanwhile, on October 30, 1995, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCAD) also received from the Department of Justice a First Indorsement, dated October 19, 1995 referring the same complaint dated September 8, 1995 for appropriate action. [1]\n\nLikewise, the Office of the Ombudsman sent its First Indorsement to the OCAD Complaint No. 95-2434 dated October 30, 1995 entitled \"Concerned Career Government Employee v. Aida Clores-Ramos\" complaining about the unethical actuations and lifestyle of the subject Court Stenographer for carrying an extra-marital relationship with a married man. [2]\n\nIn answer, respondent Aida C. Ramos alleged that she is an employee of the RTC, Branch 29, Libmanan, Camarines Sur as Court Stenographer III, having been employed since June 16, 1983. She, however, vehemently denied the allegations contained in the letter-complaint of Mrs. Josefina Marquez that she carried an illicit and immoral relationship with Mr. Florencio Marquez and narrated the following:\n\nx x x.\n\n2.a that since respondent's employment with the Court in 1983, she had never been a subject of any Administrative Complaint as her professional conduct as a public servant and in her private life and her community had been beyond reproach;\n\n2.b that respondent's fate was not kind to her. She was a victim of deception and betrayal twice over. In 1988, her husband, Raul D. Ramos, a womanizer, abandoned her and her son Ronan C. Ramos for other women and she was left alone to fend for her son and ailing mother;\n\n2.c That as fate would had its way, sometime on February, 1993 respondent cross paths with an old \"gentleman\" by the name of Florencio Marquez. She came to know him as a Balikbayan and a long time resident of the United States of America;\n\n2.d That Mr. Florencio Marquez like a wolf in a sheepskin's clothing, introduced himself as a \"widower\" since 1954. Then, he began courting her. He was a persistent suitor and promised marriage in the United States;\n\n2.e That Mr. Florencio Marquez to \"prove\" his representations as to his civil status, even gave respondent copies of certifications from the Local Civil Registrar of Libmanan, Camarines Sur regarding his previous marriage with Prudencia Frondozo and the fact of her death on January 9, 1954, which are appended hereto as Annexes \"A\" and \"B\", respectively, to form part hereof;\n\n2.f That respondent's only fault was that because of her rural upbringing and of her being na\u00efve in the ways of the world, she came to trust him and started to believe in Mr. Marquez's \"sincerity\" and \"good intentions\". So that on March, 1993, because of his persistence, respondent was prevailed upon to accept an invitation to have dinner with him. That acceptance started her travails leading to her present desolate situation;\n\n2.g That Mr. Florencio Marquez made respondent drink wine and not accustomed to it, she felt dizzy and fall asleep, only found out in the following morning that he had carnal knowledge of her. Outrage and self pity overcome respondent but the \"gentleman\" assuaged her emotional outpourings with his \"assurances\" and offer marriage in the United States of America;\n\n2.h That from thereon, the liasons became frequent and the promise of being brought to the United States and marriage in that country seemed endless;\n\n2.i That eventually, respondent got pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy on December 8, 1993 and was christened Florencio Marquez, Jr. The \"widower\" from looks of it was vent on migrating back to the United States with respondent and her son and was told to prepare her travelling papers with dispatch;\n\n2.j That it was at this point that respondent discovered the deception made on her by this \"widower\" gentleman. He was not after all a \"widower\" as he is very much a married man.\n\n2.k That respondent upon her discovery of Mr. Marquez's true Civil Status immediately severed her relationship with him and has no intention whatsoever in resuming the same now or in the near future. [3] In the Resolution of February 14, 1996, the case was referred to Executive Judge Salvador G. Cajot, RTC of Libmanan, Camarines Sur for Investigation/Report and Recommendation. [4]\n\nMeanwhile, the OCAD received a letter from complainant addressed to then Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa, withdrawing her complaint against respondent, stating that after conducting her own personal discreet investigation she discovered that the information given to her about the morality of Ms. Aida Clores-Ramos is not true, particularly the information that linked Florencio Marquez as her lover. She added \"that all the information given to [her] by the persons who pretended to help [her] were in fact and in truth have ulterior motives in destroying the honor, dignity and even the future of innocent persons, including Mr. Marquez.\" [5]\n\nBefore acting on the letter, the Court required the respondent to comment thereon. In response, complainant submitted to the Court a manifestation denying that she was the author of said letter of withdrawal. On the contrary, she stated that she was, in fact, very much interested and eager to pursue her case against respondent. She asked, however, that the Executive Judge of the RTC, Libmanan, Camarines Sur to whom this case was assigned for investigation should inhibit himself from conducting the investigation because said judge is a good friend of her husband. [6]\n\nThe case was then referred to Judge Lore V. Bagalacsa, RTC, Branch 56 of Libmanan, Camarines Sur for Investigation, Report and Recommendation.\n\nAccordingly, on June 22, 1998, Judge Lore Valencia-Bagalacsa submitted her Report and Recommendation finding respondent guilty of the charges against her and recommended her suspension for a period of one (1) year.\n\nThe evidence for complainant as described in Judge Valencia-Bagalacsa's report is as follows:\nJosefina Asuncion Demagante, a young widow of twenty-three married twenty-six year old widower Florencio Marquez in religious rites on January 5, 1955 at Libmanan, Camarines Sur (Exhibit A, p. 119, Vol. 2, Record). In their later years both went to the United States, but Marquez went home to the Philippines ahead of his wife as a `balikbayan.' He met one Aida Clores-Ramos, a court stenographer assigned at Branch 29 of Regional Trial Court in this jurisdiction. (see Complaint, pp. 6-7, Vol. 1, Record) Marquez and Ramos lived together in the years 1993 and 1994 and the latter gave birth to a son, who was born on December 8, 1993 and was baptized as Florencio Marquez, Jr., on February 11, 1994 (Exhibit B, p. 20, Vol. 1 and p. 120, Vol. 2, Record). While in the United States, Josefina Marquez learned of her husband's amorous relation with another woman, so she confronted him with it. Her husband wrote on September 7, 1993 (Exhibit C, p. 11, Vol. I, Record) and admitted the relation. He even named the woman as \"Aida Ramos, from Garchitorena\" (Exhibit C-1). He promised his wife that if she returns to the Philippines, she is still the `number one' so she should just relax. Aida, according to Mr. Marquez in his letter to his wife, is only his `alingan' (sexual playmate) while his wife is not here in Libmanan (Exhibit C-2). However, Josefina Marquez received more information from the Philippines about her husband's illicit relation with another woman. Feeling aggrieved, complainant went home to the Philippines, in September 1994.\n\nOne day, while cleaning their closets at their Libmanan residence, she found letters from her husband to respondent, and from the latter to her husband. There were also letters with envelopes addressed to Mrs. Aida Ramos of RTC Libmanan, Camarines Sur from one Florencio Marquez. One, dated March 7, 1994 (Exhibit G, p. 10, Vol. 1 and p. 127, Vol. 2, Record) relates his flight to the U.S. which took only 12 hours. The letter likewise informed \"Ma\" that he already talked with his wife about their situation in Libmanan and that the matter is settled already, and that they have no more problem. He also sent his regards especially to his boy `Florence' (Exhibit D-2) In another letter (Exhibit D-2), \"Papa\" writes \"Mama\" that he received her letter and knew what she meant; he related that he was operated on last March 31, 1994, and but there is no need to worry as he is now fine. He informed `Mama' that he will be home on April 28, 1994. The letter is addressed to Mrs. Aida Ramos of RTC Branch 29, Libmanan, Camarines Sur, from Florencio S. Marquez of Northridge, California, as shown in the postmarked envelope (Exhibit D, p. 12, Vol. 1, p. 124, Vol. 2, Record). Complainant found another letter from \"Mama\" dated February 9, 1993 to \"Papa\" advising the latter to inform one Eva frankly that he met somebody already, that it was Belen Naval who introduced her to him, so that her Tiya Linda will not be implicated. She cautioned in her letter never to mention her name and that he can talk to her but it will be for the last time. She assured him of her trust. (Exhibit F, pp. 18 and 19, Vol. 1, and p. 126, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nJosefina Marquez claimed that the \"Mama\" or \"Ma\" in the letters refer to respondent, as her husband calls her \"Mie\" as shown in the letter dated September 7, 1993. (p. 99, Sworn Statement of Josefina Marquez, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nOn December 8, 1996, Josefina was able to verify that on that day was the birthday of Florencio Marquez' son with the respondent. She thought it wise to visit the church in Libmanan, with the expectation to see the respondent there and to be able to talk to her personally. She asked someone in the church if she knows Aida Ramos, and the woman pointed out to her a woman carrying a child. Josefina approached the woman and inquired if she was Aida Ramos, and the latter answered in the affirmative. She asked her again if the child she was carrying was the son of Florencio Marquez, and she also replied in the affirmative. She then took photographs of mother and son (Exhibits E to E-2, inclusive, p. 14, Vol. 1, and p. 125, Vol. 2, Record). Then, she invited respondent outside the church to have a talk with her. There was an exchange of words with respondent. The latter replied: \"baco man lang aco an puta, cadacol diyan\" (I am not the only whore, there are a lot of them). (p. 99, Vol. 2 Record, Supra)\n\nArlyn Marquez, the 38 year old daughter of the complainant said that she found out about the much-talked about affair through her own investigation. She often saw her father at the Regional Trial Court picking up the respondent from work. At one time, she was looking for her father and found him at respondent's residence. The affair is known to the whole of Libmanan. When the son was baptized, there were balloons with the inscription: Florence 1st Birthday from Papa and Mama.\" There was a big birthday party and almost all of the court personnel were present. Complainant's daughter also recalled the sweet moments of her father and the respondent whenever the latter was in the Marquez' residence. Respondent used to go to the family house and bet on card games with other court employees.\n\nOne time, her father flagged her down and instructed her to bring Aida, who had a gasul tank, to the latter's house, but she refused. At another time, she saw her father being fed by Aida Ramos at a fiesta in Candato, in the house of one Antonia Relucio. These incidents are all etched in the memory of Arlyn as she was very hurt, knowing that her mother is still alive but her father is maintaining another family already. To her, respondent's affair with a married man surely affects the judiciary's integrity, as the former is a court stenographer. Her father, Arlyn related, is not moved by what the people are saying about them. Arlyn claims that the two are still seen together, be it in the market or in church, hearing mass together. (Exhibit I, pp. 101-102, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nNida Macarilay an active member of the Catholic Women's League (CWL), declared that she always sees Florencio Marquez and Aida Ramos in church whenever she is assigned to collect the offerings. The two were seen riding a motorcycle together in going to church and back to Aida's house. She was able to witness the baptism on February 11, 1994 of Florencio Marquez, Jr. as she was in church that time. She also knows that Ramos and Marquez lived together in 1993 and 1994. (Exhibit J, pp. 95-96, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nEdissa Velasco and Jesusa Avila, granddaughter and great granddaughter of Florencio Marquez narrated that they personally know Aida C. Ramos, as she is the paramour of their grandfather Florencio Marquez. When their grandmother was still in the USA, they saw Marquez cuddling Aida in the latter's house while Aida was caressing him. They came to know that Aida gave birth to the child of Florencio Marquez in December 1993 and in February the son was baptized. It was the talk of the town as the love affair of the two is well known in Libmanan. On November 25, 1996, in the afternoon, they saw Florencio Marquez together with Aida Ramos and their son in Naga City, they even kissed the hand of their grandfather as a sign of respect. Then, they went on their way to MacDonald's where they saw the three again. Both affirmed that their grandfather and respondent are still maintaining their relationship. In January 1997, they saw both hearing mass together. (p. 132, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nThe house of Aida Ramos in Taban, Libmanan, Camarines Sur is only a few meters away from the barangay hall, according to Salvador Flores, Punong Barangay of Taban, Libmanan, Camarines Sur, in his certification. Mr. Marquez, according to the Barangay Captain is a regular in-house visitor in respondent's house particularly during Friday evenings, and his visit is 'within public view.' (p. 141, Vol. 2, Record).\n\nMarquez established a shoe store at the Poblacion of Libmanan, Camarines Sur, and the same is jointly managed by respondent and Mr. Marquez. A photograph of the store was taken, and the respondent (X) is shown with her body half-hidden from the camera. (p. 142, Vol. 2, Record) Evidence reveals likewise that respondent and Mr. Marquez are regularly seen riding on a motorcycle together in public displaying their amorous relations. In one photograph, Mr. Marquez, respondent and the child are seen riding a motorcycle in public. (p. 143, Vol. 2, Record) Coleen Ori\u00f1o Gray-Macapagal, attested to this fact. She claimed that she often sees Florencio Marquez and Aida Ramos riding a motorcycle together, go to mass together with their child, and even go to market together. Aida even admitted that her child is Florencio Marquez' son. She was even invited to the baptism and party of the child last February 11, 1994. The two had been deporting themselves as husband and wife and lived together until 1996. She knows that Josefina Marquez is the lawful wife of Florencio Marquez. She also knows Aida Ramos as she is her parents' neighbor at Taban. (Exhibit K, pp. 103-104, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nAdelfa Marquez, a daughter-in-law of Florencio Marquez who lives in the same house with the latter together with her family when Marquez returned from the USA in 1992, likewise gave her statement. She knows respondent to be the paramour of her father-in-law. From 1993 to 1994, Marquez lived with respondent at the latter's house in Taban, Libmanan, Camarines Sur. Allegedly, her father-in-law admitted to her that Aida Ramos wanted him to live with her and in fact, Marquez did live with her. Adelfa used to see her father-in-law in respondent's house whenever she goes to Naga City. She claims that the duo have not severed their relationship, in fact every Tuesday and Friday, Marquez leaves the house at 6:00 in the evening and returns in the morning. Sometimes, Adelfa opens the door for him. She knows this because Marquez asks her to cook early as he will go to the house of Aida. Sometimes when he comes home early in the morning of Wednesdays and Saturdays, he would tell her that he came from the house of Aida. In [the] month of January 1997, respondent and Marquez were still maintaining an affair as her father-in-law still goes to the house of Aida every Tuesday and Friday. In fact, on January 28, 1997, a Tuesday, her mother-in-law instructed her to follow her father-in-law, which she did discreetly and she saw him go to the house of Aida. (pp. 130-131, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nThe love affair of Mr. Marquez and the respondent is believed to be still existing even up to the present. Last November 1996, the two went to Manila together and upon their return, Mr. Marquez declared that nobody could ever deprive the respondent of her job. He admitted that he was still having an affair with respondent (p. 100, Sworn Statement of Josefina Marquez, Vol. 2, Record).\n\nx x x\nThe foregoing facts indubitably show that respondent deviated from the norm of conduct required of a government employee like her. Certainly, her actions are contrary to law, good morals and customs. Her behavior indicates a flagrant moral indifference to the opinion of the respectable members of the community. Respondent, allegedly being a rural bred and na\u00efve woman, was deceived by the persistent suitor whom she thought was a widower in shining armor out to save her and her young son from the clutches of despair and the pit of penury. This is credible a defense, even if she gave birth to a love child. But, the years after her knowledge of her man's marital status and her continued dalliance with him after such information, can no longer be justified. The testimonial and documentary evidences in this respect are not merely manifold but are also corroborative, convincing and trustworthy. There is likewise no showing that the complainant's witnesses are merely impelled by hatred or revenge or ulterior motive in revealing what they know.\n\nIn the examples given by former Commissioner Yango, we can draw by analogy that respondent's cohabiting with a man who is not her husband, maintaining him as a paramour, and getting pregnant while she has no husband, (respondent was able to seek an annulment of her marriage) (see sworn statement of Josefina Marquez), implies the commission of a misconduct. In this instance, there is plausible evidence that respondent, despite her knowledge of Florencio Marquez' marital status, took a defiant stand, and displayed in public her illicit relation with the latter, in contravention with the norms of conduct and of the community. Her constant appearances in public with Marquez: her riding in Marquez' motorcycle, attending mass with him, eating out in a restaurant, and going to Manila together, even with their son, reveals a behavior which is not in accord with the norm required by a government employee like her. Giving fatherly comfort and material support to one's child can be done even without a mother's presence. In fact, under the circumstances, what respondent should have done, was to fade discreetly in the background, whenever her son's father was around, to preclude any suspicion.\n\nIndeed, the private life of an employee cannot be segregated from his public life. (The Solicitor General, in his brief in Nera vs. Garcia, et al. G.R. No. L-13169, January 30, 1960). A public officer or employee's conduct, both in private and public, must be guided by the required norms of behavior. Any misconduct in one's private life will always reflect on his public existence and vice versa. [7] We adopt the findings, conclusions and recommendation of the investigating judge.\n\nIt can not be overemphasized that every employee of the judiciary should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty. Like any public servant, he must exhibit the highest sense of honesty and integrity not only in the performance of his official duties but in his personal and private dealings with other people, to preserve the Court's good name and standing. [8] This is because the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel. Thus, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and every one in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple of justice. [9]\n\nRespondent, in the instant case, is indeed guilty of violating this norm of conduct. It is borne out by evidence, testimonial or documentary, that she has maintained an illicit relationship with a married man, the husband of herein complainant Josefina Marquez. We do agree with the investigating judge that her continued relationship with Florencio Marquez even after she learned that he was already married is condemnable. Neither can we accept the defense that her constant meeting with Florencio Marquez was a necessity since the latter was fulfilling his obligations as a father to their son. Prudence dictates that if respondent was indeed serious in severing her relationship with Florencio Marquez, she should have discreetly kept a distance from him. There is even more reason to believe that she did not intend to break away from Florencio Marquez. This open relationship with a married man is certainly in contravention with the norms of conduct of the community. This public display of illicit relationship is considered a disgraceful and immoral conduct, one which calls for disciplinary action under the Civil Service Law and which the Supreme Court will never sanction on its employees. [10] We reiterate what was enunciated in Burgos v. Aquino : [11]\nThe Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of court personnel must be free from any whiff of impropriety, not only with respect to his duties in the judicial branch but also to his behavior outside the court as a private individual. There is no dichotomy of morality; a court employee is also judged by his private morals. These exacting standards of morality and decency have been strictly adhered to and laid down by the Court to those in the service of the judiciary. Respondent, as a court stenographer, did not live up to her commitment to lead a moral life. Her act of maintaining relation with Atty. Burgos speaks for itself. IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, we find respondent Aida Clores-Ramos guilty of disgraceful, immoral conduct and is hereby SUSPENDED for a period of one (1) year without pay. Let a copy of this decision be entered in respondent's personal record.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Pardo, and Ynares-Santiago, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 1.\n\n[2] Id ., at 41-42.\n\n[3] Id., at 46-47.\n\n[4] Id ., at 51.\n\n[5] Id ., at 58.\n\n[6] Id ., at 64.\n\n[7] In Re: Investigation Report of the Letter-complaint of Mrs. Josefina Marquez against Aida Clores-Ramos (Aida Clores) Court Stenographer.\n\n[8] Estellar v .

JOSUE B. DUMLAO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nKAPUNAN, J.:\n\nBefore this Court on automatic review is the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City, Branch 27, dated April 29, 1997, in Criminal Case Nos. 7257-AF and 7258-AF sentencing accused-appellant Josue B. Dumlao to the supreme penalty of death for raping his two nieces.\n\nOn February 10, 1997, two separate complaints were filed before the Regional Trial Court of Cabantuan City, charging accused-appellant with rape. The first was filed by Jennifer Dumlao Matutino, assisted by her father Fernando Matutino. The complaint stated:\nCriminal Case No. 7257-AF\n\nThat on or about between the year 1991 and May 1996, at Barangays San Isidro and Sta. Lucia Old, respectively , Municipality of Zaragoza, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of force and lewd designs, violence and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously abuse and had sexual intercourse on the person of the undersigned against her will, to the damage and prejudice of herein complainant, a minor.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nCabanatuan City, Philippines, December 2, 1996.\n\n(Sgd.) JENNIFER D. MATUTINO\nComplainant [1] The second complaint was filed by Jennifer's older sister, Benita Dumlao Matutino, who was also assisted by her father Fernando Matutino. The complaint similarly charged accused-appellant as follows:\nCriminal Case No. 7258-AF\n\nThat on or about between the year 1991 and May 1996, at Barangays San Isidro and Sta. Lucia Old, respectively , Municipality of Zaragoza, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of force and lewd designs, violence and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously abuse and had sexual intercourse on the person of the undersigned against her will, to the damage and prejudice of herein complainant, a minor.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nCabanatuan City, Philippines, December 2, 1996.\n\n(Sgd.) BENITA D. MATUTINO\nComplainant [2] Upon arraignment, accused pleaded Not Guilty to both charges. Thereafter, as agreed upon by the parties, the two cases were tried jointly.\n\nThe prosecution, through its witnesses Dr. Raol Paculan, Benita Dumlao Matutino, Jennifer Dumlao Matutino, Dr. Agripina Reyes and Fernando Matutino established the following facts:\n\nThe victims, Benita Dumlao Matutino and Jennifer Dumlao Matutino are the daughters of spouses Fernando Matutino and Merlyn Dumlao. Both children were staying in the home of Virginia Baldonado, their maternal grandmother, since their parents became estranged in 1992. [3] Baldonado's house is located at Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija. They lived in said house with their grandmother, the accused-appellant whom they called \"Tito Judy\", who was the brother of their mother, \"Tito Nonong/Kuya Nonong\", \"Tatang Sonny\" and \"Ate Rowena\". The house, which had two storeys, had one bedroom on each floor. [4] Benita and Jennifer together with their grandmother, Ate Rowena and Kuya Nonong slept in the room located upstairs, while the accused-appellant slept downstairs in the room beside the kitchen. [5]\n\nJennifer, one of the victims, testified that sometime in May, 1996, at around 10:00 p.m., she was roused from her sleep by accused-appellant. [6] The latter lifted her from the bed where she and her sister Benita were sleeping, covered her mouth, and brought her to the room downstairs. [7] She was able to recognize him since the room was illuminated by a gas lamp. [8] Accused-appellant removed her clothes and lay beside her, then went on to kiss her cheeks and embrace her. Jennifer slapped the accused-appellant. He parted her legs, placed himself on top of her, removed his shirt, and inserted his penis into her vagina [9] for about ten minutes. [10]\n\nJennifer further stated that her grandmother was not in the house when she was raped by accused-appellant that night. Her grandmother was then confined in a hospital in La Paz, Tarlac. [11] Only she, her sister Benita and accused-appellant were left in the house. [12]\n\nJennifer kept quiet about the incident because accused-appellant threatened her with physical harm should she ever report the incident to anyone. [13] However, she told her sister Benita about what accused-appellant had done to her two days after the incident, and Benita in turn told Jennifer that she (Benita) was also raped by the accused-appellant. [14]\n\nThe physical examination conducted by Dr. Raol Paculan disclosed that Jennifer had multiple healed lacerations on her hymen at 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock positions, [15] and that her hymen was no longer intact, indicating that she had lost her virginity. [16]\n\nAt the time she was raped in May, 1996, Jennifer was only eleven (11) years old, having been born on July 12, 1984, [17] as indicated in her birth certificate. [18]\n\nBenita Matutino testified that sometime in May, 1996, at around 1:00 a.m., while she was sleeping in the room located on the second floor of her grandmother's house, she was awakened from her sleep by the accused-appellant, whom she found lying beside her and kissing her. [19] Benita recognized accused-appellant since the room where she was sleeping was lighted. [20] Accused-appellant later succeeded in undressing her despite her resistance by kicking and pushing him away from her, because he was much stronger than she was. Accused-appellant held her hands tightly, and threatened to kill her and her sister Jennifer if she resisted. [21] He then inserted his penis into her vagina. [22] Benita recounted that on the day she was raped by accused-appellant, only she, Jennifer and accused-appellant were in the house of her grandmother, because the latter and their other companions in the house were in the hospital. [23]\n\nBenita did not tell her grandmother about what happened because she was afraid that the accused-appellant would kill her and her sister. [24] It was only sometime after the accused-appellant left their grandmother's house in September, 1996 to reside elsewhere that Benita wrote an undated letter to their father informing him that she and Jennifer were raped by accused-appellant in May, 1996, and that he had repeatedly raped them since 1991. [25] Benita sent said letter through her friend Girlie Soliman. [26] The letter reads:\nTatay,\n\nBago ang lahat binabati ko kayo ng magandang araw. Sana ay lagi kayong nasa mabuting kalagayan na malayo sa anumang sakit lalo na at si Kuyang kaya nga pala ako sumulat ay dahil sa ipagtatapat ko sa inyo pasensiya na kayo kung idinaaan ko pa sa sulat dahil nahihiya ako sa inyong sabihin ito ng harap harapan eto ay dahil sa nangyayaring hindi maganda sa aming dalawa ni Jenny. Matagal na naming gusto itong sabihin at dahil rin natatakot ako na sabihin ito at nagkaroon ako ng lakas ng loob. Ito ay dahil kay Tito Jude na hinahalay niya kami binababoy pinagsasamantalahan ng hayop na yoon huwag ka sanang mabibigla sa sinabi kong ito dahil yaan ay matagal na sa aming ginagawa ni Judy nodon pang buo pa ang ating bahay noong buo pa ang ating pamilya naaawa ako kay Jenny bata pa siya ginanoon na siya debaling ako nalan huwag na siya dahil masyado pa siyang bata tay sana ay wag mo sila Divinang pabayaan dahil ayokong mangyari (ang nangyari) sa kanila ang nangyari sa amin ngayon nagpapasalamat ako at nagawa konang isumbong sa inyo at ngayon nandito ako kanila Merlinda dito ako nakatira marami sa aking umaampon isa lang ang nagustuhan ko kanila Ate Wennie mababait sila.

Madalas kong naiisip na kaya siguro sa akin ito ginawa ay dahil galit sila sa ating pamilya wag sana kayong magagalit kung wala ang address namin dito dahil ayoko ng umuwi sa atin sa asiyenda ayoko na tay sawang sawa na ako daig pa namin ni Jenny may asawa tay mahal na mahal kita si Nanay at ang aking mga kapatid.\n\nhanggang dito na lang ang aking sulat\n\nAng iyong anak\n\n(Sgd.) Benita Matutino\n\nI love you\nmy\nFamily [27] Subsequently, her father fetched Benita in Panganiban, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija where she was staying and verified from her whether what she said in her letter was true. Her father then asked his sister to fetch Jennifer from their grandmother's house.\n\nThereafter, he brought Jennifer and Benita to the police station in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija to report the crimes. [28] Benita executed a sworn statement before the police, stating that sometime in May, 1996, at around 1:00 a.m., accused-appellant undressed and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. She said that the accused-appellant had been raping her since she was nine years old. She also explained that she did not report the said incidents earlier because accused-appellant threatened to kill her if she told anyone regarding the same. [29]\n\nBenita also testified that on October 2, 1996, her father and a policeman brought her and her sister to the Dr. Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Research and Medical Center for physical examination. [30]\n\nThe physical examination conducted on Benita by Dr. Agripina Reyes revealed that the victim had multiple healed lacerations on her hymen at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 o'clock positions. [31] Dr. Reyes also stated that Benita's hymen was no longer intact, indicating that she had lost her virginity. [32]\n\nBenita was only 13 years old when she was raped by accused-appellant in May, 1996. [33] Her birth certificate which she presented in court indicates that she was born on August 14, 1982. [34]\n\nThe victims' father, Fernando Matutino, corroborated his daughters' statements. He told the court that on September 13, 1996, he received a letter from Benita informing him that she and Jennifer had been raped by accused-appellant. [35] Thereafter, he looked for his two daughters. When he found Benita, he asked her again whether what she said in her letter was true. She answered him in the affirmative. Subsequently, he brought his daughters to the police station in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija to report the crimes. [36] He executed a statement [37] which was used as basis for the filing of the criminal complaints against accused-appellant.\n\nThe defense presented three witnesses, namely Virginia Baldonado, the accused-appellant himself and Roel Dumlao.\n\nVirginia testified that sometime in May 28, 1996, when the alleged rapes were committed, she was confined in a hospital in La Paz, Tarlac where she stayed for three days. [38] Benita and Jennifer were left at her house. She said that accused-appellant stayed with her in the hospital on May 29, 1996 and he, together with her children Samuel, Roel and Rowena were with her when she was released therefrom. [39] Upon her return, her grandchildren made no report whatsoever about having been raped by the accused-appellant. [40] She further stated that accused-appellant seldom slept in her house since he was often out in the fields, located about two kilometers away from her house, pasturing ducks ( itik ), and that Benita and Jennifer only stayed with her in her house when they had classes. [41] Baldonado added that accused-appellant did not sleep in her house from May 1 to 31, 1996, and that Benita and Jennifer stayed in the house of her son Roel while she was confined in the hospital. [42]\n\nAccused-appellant denied the charges against him [43] and claimed that the filing thereof were probably instigated by the victims' father, stating that maybe because when he [Fernando Matutino] took another wife he charged us so that his relationship with us may be severed. [44] He claimed that since 1990 or 1991, he spent most of his time pasturing ducks. [45] From 1991 to May, 1996, his pasture area was in a field in Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija, which, according to him, was a two-hour walk from Baldonado's house. [46] His working hours were from 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. everyday. [47] He said that he seldom went home to his mother's house because he would usually sleep in the fields and his food and other needs were brought to him by his brothers. [48]\n\nRoel Dumlao, a younger brother of the accused-appellant, testified that sometime in 1996, before the schoolyear started, he engaged the services of accused-appellant to pasture some 600 ducks owned by him. [49] He said that accused-appellant was at all times attending to the ducks in a pasture area in Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija, which was located about two kilometers away from Baldonado's house. [50] Roel added that the distance between the pasture area and Baldonado's house can be negotiated by walking for less than one hour. [51] He stated further that sometime in May, 1996, his niece Jennifer stayed with him for about a month. Jennifer did not tell him anything about being raped by accused-appellant. [52]\n\nOn April 25, 1997, the trial court promulgated its Joint Decision, the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds and so holds the accused JOSUE DUMLAO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in each of the two cases, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of:\nDEATH in Criminal Case No. 7257-AF, and for him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages;\n\nDEATH in Criminal Case No. 7258-AF, and for him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00, as moral and exemplary damages; and\n\nto pay the costs of this suit.\nSO ORDERED. [53]\nAccused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in giving credence to the \"inherently incredible, inconsistent and contradictory testimonies\" of Benita and Jennifer. [54] With respect to Jennifer, accused-appellant points out that it is unbelievable for her not to have screamed upon finding that a man was lying next to her and performing sexual acts on her, and not to have attempted to wake her sister who was sleeping beside her. [55] He stresses that it was only during cross-examination when Jennifer said that accused-appellant brought her out of the room where she and Benita were sleeping and transferred to the room downstairs. [56] He also argues that it could not have been possible for him to have maintained his hand on Jennifer's mouth to keep her from crying out loud while kissing her, embracing her, taking off her clothes and pushing her legs apart. [57]\n\nAccused-appellant claims that Benita's testimony is likewise incredible, having stated that her sister was beside her when she was allegedly raped by accused-appellant, yet she did not scream or try to rouse Jennifer from her sleep to help her. [58]\n\nIt is also alleged by him that the testimonies of both complainants were not straightforward, but rehearsed, as evidenced for instance by the fact that they could tell the time during which they were raped even though it was not established that there was a clock in the room or whether any church bells chimed to indicate the time. [59] Moreover, it took complainants a long time before they reported the incidents to anyone, [60] and they failed to specify the threats supposedly made by him on them. [61]\n\nAccused-appellant also assails the credibility of the testimony of Fernando Matutino, stating that the latter had a grudge against his wife, accused-appellant's sister, who had earlier left him for another man. [62]\n\nHe argues further that even the medical findings of Dr. Raol Paculan and Dr. Agripina Reyes failed to conclusively prove that the hymenal lacerations found in both Benita and Jennifer were caused by the alleged rapes. Both physicians admitted that hymenal lacerations can be caused by pulling sharp objects, masturbation or scratching. [63]\n\nIn addition, accused-appellant argues that the trial court should have quashed the informations filed against him for being vague as to the time of the commission of the offense, because the informations stated that the rapes were committed \"on or about between the year 1991 and May, 1996.\" [64]\n\nAccused-appellant also alleges that the trial court demonstrated partiality in favor of the prosecution during the trial, in violation of his constitutional rights. He points out that the trial court judge actively participated in nine out of the ten hearings on the cases, by directly propounding questions to the witnesses. [65]\n\nThe Court is not convinced by accused-appellant's arguments.\n\nArticle 335 of the Revised Penal Code, which defined the crime of Rape prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 8353 (the Anti-Rape Law of 1997), states:\nWhen and how rape is committed. -- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:\nBy using force or intimidation;\n\nWhen the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and\n\nWhen the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.\nThe crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua:\n\nx x x\n\nThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances.\nWhen the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.\nIn reviewing the cases before us, the Court observed the following guidelines which it had earlier formulated for the review of rape cases:\n(1) an accusation of rape, can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove and even harder for the person accused to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense's evidence. [66]\nThe evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant raped his niece Jennifer who in May, 1996 was only 11 years old. [67] Jennifer positively identified accused-appellant in open court as the one who raped her sometime in May, 1996, at around 10:00 p.m.:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ | Jennifer Matutino do you know Jose Dumlao alias \"Judy\"?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Why do you know him?\nA | Because he is the brother of my mother, sir.\n | \nQ | In other words Josue Dumlao is your uncle?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Is Josue Dumlao, the accused in this case, present in Court?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Can you point to him?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Please point to him?\nA | Witness stood up and pointed to a man inside the Courtroom and who, when asked of his name answered Josue Dumlao.\n | \nATTY.

(The witness stood up and directly pointed to the accused Josue Dumlao) [68] The trial court observed that she testified as to the details of the rape committed upon Jennifer in no uncertain terms, in direct and unwavering statements.

[70]\n\nThe fact that she did not scream when accused-appellant started kissing her does not make her story less credible, contrary to accused's argument. It should be noted that Jennifer was sleeping before she was awakened by her accused-appellant's presence in her bed. The Court agrees with the Solicitor General that \"[i]n such a situation not everyone would scream because people react differently to shocking events\" [71] such as what Jennifer went through. Moreover, accused-appellant had moral ascendancy over the victim, being the uncle, hence, the natural tendency of the victim is not to scream but to struggle and resist quietly because of shock and confusion. [72]\n\nThe Court likewise agrees with the trial court's finding that Benita Matutino's testimony that she was raped by accused-appellant using force and intimidation sometime in May, 1996 is credible. Benita categorically stated that sometime in May, 1996, while she was sleeping in the room on the second floor of her grandmother's house, she was awakened from her sleep by accused-appellant, who was lying beside her and kissing her; [73] that accused-appellant was able to undress her despite the fact that she was kicking and pushing him away from her, because he was much stronger than she was; that accused-appellant held her hands tightly, and threatened to kill her and her sister Jennifer if she resisted him; [74] that accused-appellant succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina. [75] The credibility of her testimony was not found to have been diminished by the lapse of some four months before she reported what accused-appellant had done to her and her sister. As held by the trial court, immediately after accused-appellant left the house of her grandmother to reside elsewhere, Benita wrote a letter to her father, telling him that she and Jennifer were raped; she also fled from her grandmother's house to avoid further sexual molestation. [76] It has been held that delay in reporting rape incidents in the face of physical violence cannot be taken against the victim, because oftentimes, the rape victim's actions are dictated by fear rather than by reason. [77]\n\nThe trial court's evaluation of the victims' testimonies in the cases at bar is entitled to the highest respect because it had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses on the stand. Furthermore, as previously held by this Court in People vs. Rodegelio Turco , Jr. , [78]\nx x x when the offended parties are young and immature girls from the ages of twelve to sixteen, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed by court trial if the matter about which they testified were not true. x x x\nThe Court notes that the records of the cases fully support the lower court's findings.\n\nThe trial court held that the victims' testimonies were corroborated by the respective reports of the physicians who conducted physical examinations on them. The report of Dr. Paculo who examined Jennifer revealed that her hymen was no longer intact, indicating that she had lost her virginity, [79] and that the child had multiple healed hymenal lacerations at 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock positions. [80] Likewise, the physical examination report of Dr. Reyes who conducted the examination on Benita stated that she suffered multiple lacerations in her hymen at at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 o'clock positions, [81] and that her hymen was no longer intact, a sign that she was no longer a virgin. [82]\n\nNo error was committed by the trial court in giving more credence to the testimonies and other evidence presented by the prosecution than the accused-appellant's denial of the charges against him. All that accused-appellant offered in his defense was the alibi that he hardly slept in Baldonado's house because he spent most of his time pasturing ducks [83] in a field in Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija. According to him, it would take about two hours to walk from the pasture field to Baldonado's house and vice-versa. [84] Certainly, accused-appellant's alibi cannot prevail over the testimony of the victims and their positive identification of accused-appellant as the person who raped them. [85]\n\nWhile this Court affirms the finding of the lower court that the accused-appellant is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having raped both Benita and Jennifer, it cannot affirm the imposition of the penalty of death in either case because the relationship between accused-appellant to the victims, i.e., that he was their uncle and therefore a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree, was not alleged in either of the two complaints. [86] The relationship between accused-appellant and each of the two victims should have been specifically alleged in the criminal complaints for rape before the trial court imposed the death penalty upon accused-appellant. The reason behind this requirement was explained in People vs. Antonio Ferolino, [87] thus:\nThese seven attendant circumstances [ mentioned in Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. No. 7659 [88] ], given that they alter the nature of the crime of rape and thus increase the degree of the penalty, are in the nature of qualifying circumstances. Plainly, these attendant circumstances added by R.A. 7659 are not ordinary aggravating circumstances, which merely increase the period of the penalty. These are special qualifying circumstances which must be specifically pleaded or alleged with certainty in the information; otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed.\nHaving failed to allege that accused-appellant is the uncle, i.e., relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree of Benita and Jennifer, the penalty imposable for each charge of rape shall be reclusion perpetua .\n\nIt is also necessary to increase the award of damages as fixed by the trial court. The lower court in its decision ordered the accused-appellant to indemnify each of the victims in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) only, representing moral and exemplary damages. Under prevailing jurisprudence, however, the award of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil imdemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape. [89] The Court has previously explained that the indemnity authorized under the law [90] as civil liability ex delicto for the offended party is equivalent to actual or compensatory damages in civil law. [91] It is not to be confused with moral damages, which is awarded when it is shown that the victim suffered physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation and similar injury. [92]\n\nIn addition to civil indemnity, moral damages may be awarded to rape victims, [93] without need of proof other than the fact of the rape itself. [94] The fact that each of the victims suffered mental, physical and psychological trauma as a result of the rape are too obvious to still require the recital thereof at trial. [95] Under current rulings, the award of moral damages should be in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) for each crime. [96]\n\nFurthermore, where the existence of an aggravating circumstance is proven, as in the cases before us where the circumstances of minority and relationship were established, exemplary damages may be awarded, in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code. [97] Thus, an award of exemplary damages in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) for each count of rape in the cases before us is proper. [98]\n\nWHEREFORE , the joint decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City, Branch 27 in Criminal Case Nos. 7257-AF and 7258-AF finding accused-appellant JOSUE B. DUMLAO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in each of the two cases is hereby AFFIRMED , with the MODIFICATION that the penalty in each case is reduced to reclusion perpetua. Accused-appellant is likewise sentenced to pay the following amounts:\n\n(1) In Criminal Case No. 7257-AF, to pay complainant Jennifer Matutino Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages; and Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages; and\n\n(2) In Criminal Case No. 7258-AF, to pay complainant Benita Matutino Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages; and Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr., Gutierrez , and Carpio, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Records, Crim.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ALDRIN BERDADERO Y ARMAMENTO, APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N DEL CASTILLO, J.: Strict compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 regarding the custody and disposition of evidence against the accused may be excused under justifiable grounds. If the justifiable reason could no longer be determined due to the defense's failure to raise it in issue during trial, it is of vital importance to establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved since these would be determinative of whether the accused is guilty or not.[1]Factual AntecedentsOn March 28, 2003, an Information[2] was filed against appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento (appellant) for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 12861. The accusatory allegations of the Information read:That on or about March 25, 2003, at around 2:40 o'clock in the afternoon at Arrieta Subdivision (Brgy. 20), Batangas City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, dispense or deliver 0.04 gram of shabu, [also] known as \"methamphetamine hydrochloride\" a dangerous drug, which is a clear violation of the above-cited law.Contrary to Law.On arraignment, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. In the trial that ensued, the prosecution and the defense presented different accounts of the events that transpired prior to and during the appellant's arrest.The Version of the ProsecutionThe Investigation Section of the Batangas City Police Station received a report from an informant that the appellant was selling shabu. Thus, PO3 Danilo F. Balmes (PO3 Balmes) and PO2 Edwalberto M. Villas (PO2 Villas) organized a buy-bust operation and designated the informant as the poseur-buyer.Thereafter, the two police officers and the informant went to the target area and parked the van they were using in front of appellant's house. After alighting from the vehicle, the informant talked to the appellant. A few minutes later, the appellant went inside his house. When he returned, he handed to the informant two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance in exchange for the marked money. The informant then gave the pre-arranged signal that the sale was consummated.The police officers who were observing the transaction from inside the van apprehended the appellant and recovered the marked money from him. They apprised the appellant of his constitutional rights before taking him to the barangay hall to record the entrapment operation and the evidence seized from the appellant in the blotter. The informant turned over the plastic sachets to PO3 Balmes. They then proceeded to the police station.Upon their arrival, the buy-bust operation and the items confiscated from the appellant were recorded in the police blotter. The desk officer, PO1 Arnold delos Reyes (PO1 Delos Reyes), prepared the complaint sheet while PO3 Balmes placed markings on the plastic sachets. The first sachet was marked DFB-1 with the date 3-25-03, while the second sachet was marked DFB-2 with the same date. The sachets were then submitted for laboratory examination, which tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.The Version of the DefenseThe appellant claimed that he was a victim of frame-up. He testified that at around 2:40 in the afternoon of March 25, 2003, two men came to his house and introduced themselves as locksmiths. His mother allowed them to enter and showed them the defective keys. After a while, the men left, but they returned 10 minutes later, kicked the door open and handcuffed him. He asked why he was being arrested but no explanation was forthcoming. He was instead brought to the police station.The appellant denied that illicit drugs were recovered from him and that the two men who arrested him were PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas.Ruling of the Regional Trial CourtOn October 10, 2005, the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, rendered its Decision[3] convicting the appellant. The dispositive portion reads:Wherefore, finding the evidence of the Prosecution satisfying that degree of moral certainty, accused Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento is found Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of having violated Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 as set forth in the information filed in this case. He is therefore sentenced to pay a fine of P500,000.00 and to undergo life imprisonment pursuant to law. He is however, credited with his preventive imprisonment if he is entitled to any.The specimens subject of chemistry Report No. D-634-03 (Exhibit \"C\") made by Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas is confiscated and directed to be proceeded against pursuant to law.SO ORDERED.[4]Ruling of the Court of AppealsDissatisfied, the appellant appealed before the Court of Appeals (CA). However, in its Decision[5] promulgated on July 3, 2007, the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit and affirmed in toto the ruling of the trial court.IssuesThus, this appeal with the following assignment of errors:ITHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.IIASSUMING, THAT THE VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION IS CORRECT, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.[6]The appellant insists that no buy-bust operation ever transpired and that his arrest was unlawful. He also contends that the prosecution failed to prove that the alleged buy-bust operation complied with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules since the police authorities neither inventoried nor photographed the seized drugs and marked money in his presence or that of his counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice. The appellant likewise assails the authority of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas to conduct the alleged buy-bust operation for failure of the prosecution to prove that they were deputized by the PDEA as required under Section 81 of RA 9165. And even assuming that there was faithful compliance with the mandates of RA 9165, the appellant argues that the poseur-buyer's testimony became material and indispensable due to his denial of having committed the prohibited act of selling the dangerous drug. Thus, it is the appellant's conclusion that the seizure and custody over the seized drugs is void.Our RulingThe appeal is unmeritorious.The elements necessary to establish a case for illegal sale of shabu are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. What is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug in evidence.[7]The prosecution successfully proved the existence of all the essential elements of the illegal sale of shabu. The appellant was positively identified by police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation as the seller of the shabu presented in the case. PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas testified that their confidential informant acted as the buyer of the shabu from the appellant. It was likewise established that the sale actually occurred and that two sachets of shabu were sold for the price of P500.00. The marked money used in the buy-bust operation was duly adduced in evidence. The shabu sold by the appellant was also positively and categorically identified during trial.Prosecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation.[8] The trial court in this case, as affirmed by the CA, held that the testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas were unequivocal, straightforward, and consistent in material respects with each other and with other testimonies and physical evidence. We find no cogent reason to overturn said findings.The appellant's defense of frame-up must fail. We have previously ruled that frame-up is a banal defense of those accused in drug-related cases that is viewed with disfavor. Like the defense of alibi, frame-up is an allegation that can easily be concocted. For this claim to prosper, the defense must adduce clear and convincing evidence, which the appellant failed to do.[9] There was no proof proffered to overturn the presumption that the arresting police officers regularly performed their duties. The appellant also did not prove that the prosecution witnesses were maliciously motivated, which would put their credibility in doubt. Moreover, the failure to present the appellant's mother to testify and corroborate his defense of frame-up renders the same as self-serving thus unworthy of any weight in evidence.The appellant's contention that the buy-bust operation failed to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules fails to impress. Paragraph 1 of Section 21, Article II of said law outlines the procedure to be followed in the custody and handling of the seized drugs. Thus:Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instrument/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - x x x(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.x x x xThis provision is implemented by Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, viz.:(a) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over the said items.The failure of the prosecution to show that the police officers conducted the required physical inventory and photograph of the evidence confiscated pursuant to said guidelines, is not fatal. Indeed, the implementing rules that `non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over said items'.Notably, the defense did not raise this issue during trial. Be that as it may, we explained in People v. Del Monte[10] that what is of vital importance is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. The existence of the dangerous drug is a condition sine qua non for conviction for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very corpus delicti of the crime and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. Thus, it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. The chain of custody requirement performs the function of ensuring that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, so much so that unnecessary doubts as to the identity of the evidence are removed.[11]To be admissible, the prosecution must show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into possession of the police officers and until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it was offered in evidence.[12]Here, the testimonies of prosecution witnesses convincingly show that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal substance was properly preserved. PO3 Balmes marked the sachets containing shabu with his initials and the date of the appellant's arrest.[13] PO2 Villas confirmed that PO3 Balmes marked the same sachets of shabu sold by the appellant. PO1 Delos Reyes entered the arrest in the police blotter[14] then referred the appellant and the evidence to the Investigation Division.[15] PO3 Sergio del Mundo (PO3 Del Mundo) received the appellant and the evidence from PO1 Delos Reyes and prepared the request for laboratory tests on the specimens.[16] PO2 Villas brought the specimens and said letter request to the crime laboratory[17]and waited for the results.[18] Insp. Donna Villa P. Huelgas conducted the laboratory examination on the same specimens still bearing the markings of PO3 Balmes,[19] and which examination yielded positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride.[20] The results were given to PO2 Villas, who turned over the same to PO3 Del Mundo.[21]It is thus evident that the identity of the corpus delicti has been properly preserved and established by the prosecution. The appellant in this case has the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits of public officers and a presumption that public officers properly discharge their duties.[22] The appellant was unable to discharge such burden.The appellant's next argument that the evidence against him was obtained in violation of Section 86 of RA 9165 because the buy-bust operation was made without any involvement of the PDEA also fails to impress. This provision reads:SEC. 86. Transfer, Absorption, and Integration of All Operating Units on Illegal Drugs into the PDEA and Transitory Provisions. - The Narcotics Group of the PNP, the Narcotics Division of the NBI and the Customs Narcotics Interdiction Unit are hereby abolished; however they shall continue with the performance of their task as detail service with the PDEA, subject to screening, until such time that the organizational structure of the Agency is fully operational and the number of graduates of the PDEA Academy is sufficient to do the task themselves: Provided, That such personnel who are affected shall have the option of either being integrated into the PDEA or remain with their original mother agencies and shall, thereafter, be immediately reassigned to other units therein by the head of such agencies. Such personnel who are transferred, absorbed and integrated in the PDEA shall be extended appointments to positions similar in rank, salary, and other emoluments and privileges granted to their respective positions in their original mother agencies.The transfer, absorption and integration of the different offices and units provided for in this Section shall take effect within eighteen (18) months from the effectivity of this Act: Provided, That personnel absorbed and on detail service shall be given until five (5) years to finally decide to join the PDEA.Nothing in this Act shall mean a diminution of the investigative powers of the NBI and the PNP on all other crimes as provided for in their respective organic laws: Provided, however, That when the investigation being conducted by the NBI, PNP or any ad hoc anti-drug task force is found to be a violation of any of the provisions of this Act, the PDEA shall be the lead agency. The NBI, PNP or any of the task force shall immediately transfer the same to the PDEA: Provided, further, That the NBI, PNP and the Bureau of Customs shall maintain close coordination with the PDEA on all drug related matters.A perusal of the foregoing provision shows that it is silent as to the consequences of failure on the part of the law enforcers to seek the authority of the PDEA prior to conducting a buy-bust operation, in the same way that the IRR is likewise silent on the matter. However, by no stretch of imagination could this silence be interpreted as a legislative intent to make an arrest without the participation of PDEA illegal or evidence obtained pursuant to such an arrest inadmissible.[23]It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, or great public interests would be endangered or sacrificed, or great mischief done, such construction must be avoided, or the court ought to presume that such construction was not intended by the makers of the law, unless required by clear and unequivocal words.[24]As we see it, Section 86 is explicit only in saying that the PDEA shall be the \"lead agency\" in the investigations and prosecutions of drug-related cases. Therefore, other law enforcement bodies still possess authority to perform similar functions as the PDEA as long as illegal drugs cases will eventually be transferred to the latter. Moreover, the same provision states that PDEA, serving as the implementing arm of the Dangerous Drugs Board \"shall be responsible for the efficient and effective law enforcement of all the provisions on any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical as provided in the Act.\" It is only appropriate that drugs cases being handled by other law enforcement authorities be transferred or referred to the PDEA as the \"lead agency\" in the campaign against the menace of dangerous drugs. Section 86 is more of an administrative provision. By having a centralized law enforcement body, i.e., the PDEA, the Dangerous Drugs Board can enhance the efficacy of the law against dangerous drugs. To be sure, Section 86(a) of the IRR emphasizes this point by providing:Section 86. x x x(a) Relationship/Coordination between PDEA and Other Agencies - The PDEA shall be the lead agency in the enforcement of the Act, while the PNP, the NBI and other law enforcement agencies shall continue to conduct anti-drug operations in support of the PDEA x x x. Provided, finally, that nothing in the IRR shall deprive the PNP, the NBI, other law enforcement personnel and the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from effecting lawful arrests and seizures in consonance with the provisions of Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.It is therefore clear that PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas possessed and acted with authority to conduct the buy-bust operation, making the same valid.The appellant's final contention that the failure to present the poseur-buyer is fatal and entitles him to an acquittal, again fails to impress. The non-presentation of the poseur-buyer is fatal only if there is no other eyewitness to the illicit transaction.[25] The testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas sufficiently established that the appellant is guilty of selling a dangerous drug. Their referral to the shabu handed by the appellant to the poseur-buyer as \"something\" merely indicates that at the time of the sale, they could only presume that the specimen sold by the appellant was shabu since they were conducting a buy-bust operation. They still had to submit the specimen to the crime laboratory for testing which later tested positive for shabu. Thus, the fact that the poseur-buyer was not presented does not weaken the evidence for the prosecution.For the illegal sale of shabu, and there being no modifying circumstance alleged in the Information, the trial court, as sustained by the CA, correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment in accordance with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code and a fine of P500,000.00.WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01774 sustaining in all respects the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, convicting appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 is AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.Corona, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, and Perez, JJ., concur.[1] People v.

No. 179710, June 29, 2010 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ALDRIN BERDADERO Y ARMAMENTO, APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ALDRIN BERDADERO Y ARMAMENTO, APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nDEL CASTILLO, J.:\n\nStrict compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 regarding the custody and disposition of evidence against the accused may be excused under justifiable grounds. If the justifiable reason could no longer be determined due to the defense's failure to raise it in issue during trial, it is of vital importance to establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved since these would be determinative of whether the accused is guilty or not. [1]\n\nFactual Antecedents\n\nOn March 28, 2003, an Information [2] was filed against appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento (appellant) for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 12861. The accusatory allegations of the Information read:\n\nThat on or about March 25, 2003, at around 2:40 o'clock in the afternoon at Arrieta Subdivision (Brgy. 20), Batangas City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, dispense or deliver 0.04 gram of shabu , [also] known as \"methamphetamine hydrochloride\" a dangerous drug, which is a clear violation of the above-cited law.\n\nContrary to Law.\nOn arraignment, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. In the trial that ensued, the prosecution and the defense presented different accounts of the events that transpired prior to and during the appellant's arrest.\n\nThe Version of the Prosecution\n\nThe Investigation Section of the Batangas City Police Station received a report from an informant that the appellant was selling shabu . Thus, PO3 Danilo F. Balmes (PO3 Balmes) and PO2 Edwalberto M. Villas (PO2 Villas) organized a buy-bust operation and designated the informant as the poseur-buyer.\n\nThereafter, the two police officers and the informant went to the target area and parked the van they were using in front of appellant's house. After alighting from the vehicle, the informant talked to the appellant. A few minutes later, the appellant went inside his house. When he returned, he handed to the informant two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance in exchange for the marked money. The informant then gave the pre-arranged signal that the sale was consummated.\n\nThe police officers who were observing the transaction from inside the van apprehended the appellant and recovered the marked money from him. They apprised the appellant of his constitutional rights before taking him to the barangay hall to record the entrapment operation and the evidence seized from the appellant in the blotter. The informant turned over the plastic sachets to PO3 Balmes. They then proceeded to the police station.\n\nUpon their arrival, the buy-bust operation and the items confiscated from the appellant were recorded in the police blotter. The desk officer, PO1 Arnold delos Reyes (PO1 Delos Reyes), prepared the complaint sheet while PO3 Balmes placed markings on the plastic sachets. The first sachet was marked DFB-1 with the date 3-25-03, while the second sachet was marked DFB-2 with the same date. The sachets were then submitted for laboratory examination, which tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu .\n\nThe Version of the Defense\n\nThe appellant claimed that he was a victim of frame-up. He testified that at around 2:40 in the afternoon of March 25, 2003, two men came to his house and introduced themselves as locksmiths. His mother allowed them to enter and showed them the defective keys. After a while, the men left, but they returned 10 minutes later, kicked the door open and handcuffed him. He asked why he was being arrested but no explanation was forthcoming. He was instead brought to the police station.\n\nThe appellant denied that illicit drugs were recovered from him and that the two men who arrested him were PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas.\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\n\nOn October 10, 2005, the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, rendered its Decision [3] convicting the appellant. The dispositive portion reads:\n\nWherefore, finding the evidence of the Prosecution satisfying that degree of moral certainty, accused Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento is found Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of having violated Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 as set forth in the information filed in this case. He is therefore sentenced to pay a fine of P500,000.00 and to undergo life imprisonment pursuant to law. He is however, credited with his preventive imprisonment if he is entitled to any.\n\nThe specimens subject of chemistry Report No. D-634-03 (Exhibit \"C\") made by Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas is confiscated and directed to be proceeded against pursuant to law.\n\nSO ORDERED. [4]\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\n\nDissatisfied, the appellant appealed before the Court of Appeals (CA). However, in its Decision [5] promulgated on July 3, 2007, the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit and affirmed in toto the ruling of the trial court.\n\nIssues\n\nThus, this appeal with the following assignment of errors:\n\nI\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.\n\nII\n\nASSUMING, THAT THE VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION IS CORRECT, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. [6]\nThe appellant insists that no buy-bust operation ever transpired and that his arrest was unlawful. He also contends that the prosecution failed to prove that the alleged buy-bust operation complied with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules since the police authorities neither inventoried nor photographed the seized drugs and marked money in his presence or that of his counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice. The appellant likewise assails the authority of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas to conduct the alleged buy-bust operation for failure of the prosecution to prove that they were deputized by the PDEA as required under Section 81 of RA 9165. And even assuming that there was faithful compliance with the mandates of RA 9165, the appellant argues that the poseur-buyer's testimony became material and indispensable due to his denial of having committed the prohibited act of selling the dangerous drug. Thus, it is the appellant's conclusion that the seizure and custody over the seized drugs is void.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe appeal is unmeritorious.\n\nThe elements necessary to establish a case for illegal sale of shabu are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. What is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug in evidence. [7]\n\nThe prosecution successfully proved the existence of all the essential elements of the illegal sale of shabu . The appellant was positively identified by police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation as the seller of the shabu presented in the case. PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas testified that their confidential informant acted as the buyer of the shabu from the appellant. It was likewise established that the sale actually occurred and that two sachets of shabu were sold for the price of P500.00. The marked money used in the buy-bust operation was duly adduced in evidence. The shabu sold by the appellant was also positively and categorically identified during trial.\n\nProsecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation. [8] The trial court in this case, as affirmed by the CA, held that the testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas were unequivocal, straightforward, and consistent in material respects with each other and with other testimonies and physical evidence. We find no cogent reason to overturn said findings.\n\nThe appellant's defense of frame-up must fail. We have previously ruled that frame-up is a banal defense of those accused in drug-related cases that is viewed with disfavor. Like the defense of alibi, frame-up is an allegation that can easily be concocted. For this claim to prosper, the defense must adduce clear and convincing evidence, which the appellant failed to do. [9] There was no proof proffered to overturn the presumption that the arresting police officers regularly performed their duties. The appellant also did not prove that the prosecution witnesses were maliciously motivated, which would put their credibility in doubt. Moreover, the failure to present the appellant's mother to testify and corroborate his defense of frame-up renders the same as self-serving thus unworthy of any weight in evidence.\n\nThe appellant's contention that the buy-bust operation failed to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules fails to impress. Paragraph 1 of Section 21, Article II of said law outlines the procedure to be followed in the custody and handling of the seized drugs. Thus:\n\nSection 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instrument/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - x x x\n\n(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.\n\nx x x x\n\nThis provision is implemented by Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, viz .:\n\n(a) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over the said items.\n\nThe failure of the prosecution to show that the police officers conducted the required physical inventory and photograph of the evidence confiscated pursuant to said guidelines, is not fatal. Indeed, the implementing rules that `non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over said items'.\n\nNotably, the defense did not raise this issue during trial. Be that as it may, we explained in People v. Del Monte [10] that what is of vital importance is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. The existence of the dangerous drug is a condition sine qua non for conviction for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very corpus delicti of the crime and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. Thus, it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. The chain of custody requirement performs the function of ensuring that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, so much so that unnecessary doubts as to the identity of the evidence are removed. [11]\n\nTo be admissible, the prosecution must show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into possession of the police officers and until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it was offered in evidence. [12]\n\nHere, the testimonies of prosecution witnesses convincingly show that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal substance was properly preserved. PO3 Balmes marked the sachets containing shabu with his initials and the date of the appellant's arrest. [13] PO2 Villas confirmed that PO3 Balmes marked the same sachets of shabu sold by the appellant. PO1 Delos Reyes entered the arrest in the police blotter [14] then referred the appellant and the evidence to the Investigation Division. [15] PO3 Sergio del Mundo (PO3 Del Mundo) received the appellant and the evidence from PO1 Delos Reyes and prepared the request for laboratory tests on the specimens. [16] PO2 Villas brought the specimens and said letter request to the crime laboratory [17] and waited for the results. [18] Insp. Donna Villa P. Huelgas conducted the laboratory examination on the same specimens still bearing the markings of PO3 Balmes, [19] and which examination yielded positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride. [20] The results were given to PO2 Villas, who turned over the same to PO3 Del Mundo. [21]\n\nIt is thus evident that the identity of the corpus delicti has been properly preserved and established by the prosecution. The appellant in this case has the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits of public officers and a presumption that public officers properly discharge their duties. [22] The appellant was unable to discharge such burden.\n\nThe appellant's next argument that the evidence against him was obtained in violation of Section 86 of RA 9165 because the buy-bust operation was made without any involvement of the PDEA also fails to impress. This provision reads:\n\nSEC. 86. Transfer, Absorption, and Integration of All Operating Units on Illegal Drugs into the PDEA and Transitory Provisions. - The Narcotics Group of the PNP, the Narcotics Division of the NBI and the Customs Narcotics Interdiction Unit are hereby abolished; however they shall continue with the performance of their task as detail service with the PDEA, subject to screening, until such time that the organizational structure of the Agency is fully operational and the number of graduates of the PDEA Academy is sufficient to do the task themselves: Provided, That such personnel who are affected shall have the option of either being integrated into the PDEA or remain with their original mother agencies and shall, thereafter, be immediately reassigned to other units therein by the head of such agencies. Such personnel who are transferred, absorbed and integrated in the PDEA shall be extended appointments to positions similar in rank, salary, and other emoluments and privileges granted to their respective positions in their original mother agencies.\n\nThe transfer, absorption and integration of the different offices and units provided for in this Section shall take effect within eighteen (18) months from the effectivity of this Act: Provided , That personnel absorbed and on detail service shall be given until five (5) years to finally decide to join the PDEA.\n\nNothing in this Act shall mean a diminution of the investigative powers of the NBI and the PNP on all other crimes as provided for in their respective organic laws: Provided , however , That when the investigation being conducted by the NBI, PNP or any ad hoc anti-drug task force is found to be a violation of any of the provisions of this Act, the PDEA shall be the lead agency. The NBI, PNP or any of the task force shall immediately transfer the same to the PDEA: Provided , further , That the NBI, PNP and the Bureau of Customs shall maintain close coordination with the PDEA on all drug related matters.\nA perusal of the foregoing provision shows that it is silent as to the consequences of failure on the part of the law enforcers to seek the authority of the PDEA prior to conducting a buy-bust operation, in the same way that the IRR is likewise silent on the matter. However, by no stretch of imagination could this silence be interpreted as a legislative intent to make an arrest without the participation of PDEA illegal or evidence obtained pursuant to such an arrest inadmissible. [23]\n\nIt is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, or great public interests would be endangered or sacrificed, or great mischief done, such construction must be avoided, or the court ought to presume that such construction was not intended by the makers of the law, unless required by clear and unequivocal words. [24]\n\nAs we see it, Section 86 is explicit only in saying that the PDEA shall be the \"lead agency\" in the investigations and prosecutions of drug-related cases. Therefore, other law enforcement bodies still possess authority to perform similar functions as the PDEA as long as illegal drugs cases will eventually be transferred to the latter.

To be sure, Section 86(a) of the IRR emphasizes this point by providing:\n\nSection 86. x x x\n\n(a) Relationship/Coordination between PDEA and Other Agencies - The PDEA shall be the lead agency in the enforcement of the Act, while the PNP, the NBI and other law enforcement agencies shall continue to conduct anti-drug operations in support of the PDEA x x x. Provided, finally , that nothing in the IRR shall deprive the PNP, the NBI, other law enforcement personnel and the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from effecting lawful arrests and seizures in consonance with the provisions of Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.\nIt is therefore clear that PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas possessed and acted with authority to conduct the buy-bust operation, making the same valid.\n\nThe appellant's final contention that the failure to present the poseur-buyer is fatal and entitles him to an acquittal, again fails to impress. The non-presentation of the poseur-buyer is fatal only if there is no other eyewitness to the illicit transaction. [25] The testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas sufficiently established that the appellant is guilty of selling a dangerous drug. Their referral to the shabu handed by the appellant to the poseur-buyer as \"something\" merely indicates that at the time of the sale, they could only presume that the specimen sold by the appellant was shabu since they were conducting a buy-bust operation. They still had to submit the specimen to the crime laboratory for testing which later tested positive for shabu . Thus, the fact that the poseur-buyer was not presented does not weaken the evidence for the prosecution.\n\nFor the illegal sale of shabu , and there being no modifying circumstance alleged in the Information, the trial court, as sustained by the CA, correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment in accordance with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code and a fine of P500,000.00.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal is DENIED . The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01774 sustaining in all respects the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, convicting appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 is AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nCorona, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro , and Perez, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] People v.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO BARAOIL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.R E S O L U T I O N REYES, J.: This is an appeal from the Decision[1] dated May 26, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03546, which affirmed with modification the Decision[2 ]dated August 15, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 51 of Tayug, Pangasinan, in Criminal Case Nos. T-3682 and T-3683, finding Antonio Baraoil (accused-Appellant) guilty for two crimes of rape defined and penalized under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353 and the Revised Penal Code.On October 20, 2004, the accused-appellant was charged in two informations[3] for the crime of rape allegedly committed, as follows:Criminal Case No. T-3682That on or about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of August 8, 2004, inside the comfort room adjacent to the Apo Rice Mill at Brgy. San Maximo, [M]unicipality of Natividad, [P]rovince of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above- named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously insert his penis into the vagina of [AAA], a minor[,] 5 years of age and thereafter finger the vagina of said [AAA], against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA].CONTRARY to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 8353.[4]Criminal Case No. T-3683That on or about 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon of August 8, 2004, inside the comfort room adjacent to the Apo Rice Mill located at Brgy. San Maximo, [M]unicipality of Natividad, [P]rovince of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above- named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously suck the vagina of said [AAA], a minor, 5 years of age, against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA].CONTRARY to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 8353.[5]During arraignment, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty. Trial on the merits proceeded.The accused-appellant is a neighbor of the victim's (AAA) family whom they consider and respect like an uncle.According to the evidence of the prosecution, on August 8, 2004, at about 2:00 p.m., five (5) year old AAA was walking near the house of the accused-appellant when the latter saw her. He asked where she was going then he invited her to take a ride with him on his bicycle. AAA acceded because accused-appellant is a friend of her parents. The accused-appellant and AAA biked together towards the town rice mill. BBB, the elder sister of AAA, saw them. Worried about AAA\u2019s safety, BBB sought the help of CCC, her other sister, and their cousin DDD to look for AAA.Upon arriving at the rice mill, the accused-appellant parked his bicycle against the wall, and pulled AAA inside the mill's comfort room. He pulled AAA's shorts as she was not wearing underwear. The accused- appellant then sat on a toilet bowl and unzipped his pants. He lifted AAA, seated her on his lap, and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina. AAA did not shout despite feeling pain.The accused-appellant threatened AAA not to tell his mother or father about what happened or else he will repeat the act. He then inserted his right forefinger in AAA's vagina. AAA saw his finger that was thrust into her. AAA did not shout although she was about to cry. The accused-appellant removed his finger then pulled up his pants.At that moment, BBB, CCC, and DDD arrived at the rice mill and saw the accused-appellant's bicycle. They entered and heard thumping sounds coming from the comfort room. The accused-appellant then suddenly opened its door and walked out. AAA followed him after a while towards his bicycle looking visibly sweating and walking with difficulty.CCC approached the accused-appellant and told him that they will take AAA home. The accused-appellant refused and told them that he will take AAA home after buying a new pair of slippers he needed for himself. He bought the pair of slippers and a chocolate-filled biscuit for AAA.After half an hour, the accused-appellant took AAA back to the comfort room of the same rice mill. There, he undressed her and sucked her vagina. While doing this, AAA begged the accused-appellant to take her home. The accused-appellant stopped and boarded her to his bicycle and brought her home.The next day, DDD asked AAA what happened when she was with the accused-appellant. AAA did not say anything but she started to cry until she told her mother EEE all that transpired. On August 10, 2004, EEE brought AAA to the police station where they reported the incident.For the defense, the accused-appellant denied the charges and preferred an alibi by stating that he was with his friend Renato at the fish pond at the time when the alleged rape took place. He claimed that they were fishing from 7:30 to 10:00 in the morning. They also drank gin at around 3:00 p.m. and went home at 4:00 p.m. He, moreover, claimed that AAA was nice to him before the alleged rape. However, AAA's family got mad at him after he disconnected their jumper connection from the power source. They even threatened that they will hack him to death. Thus, the accusation of AAA's family was a means of revenge.On August 15, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:WHEREFORE, finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two crimes of rape, respectively defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 8353 amending the Revised Penal Code provisions on rape, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the following:1. the indeterminate penalty of from (sic) six (6) years of prision correccional maximum as minimum to ten (10) years of prision mayor medium as maximum, for the rape committed as charged in Criminal Case No. T-3683; and, 2. the death sentence of a protracted kind, namely reclusion perpetua, for the rape committed in Criminal Case No. T- 3682.Pursuant to the stipulations arrived at by the parties at the pre-trial stage, the accused is likewise condemned to indemnify the private complainant for damages in the agreed total sum of [P]200,000.00; and, to pay the costs.SO ORDERED.[6]The trial court lent credence to the testimony of AAA that she was raped. The trial court found her testimony categorical, straightforward and candid. Moreover, in upholding the credibility of AAA, the trial court relied heavily on established doctrines in rape cases.On September 1, 2008, the accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal.[7] The CA, in a Decision dated May 26, 2010, affirmed the accused-appellant's conviction with modification, viz:1. In Criminal Case No. T-3682, appellant is ordered to pay private complainant AAA, the amounts of [P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]50,000.00 as moral damages and [P]25,000.00 as exemplary damages.2. In Criminal Case No. T-3683, appellant is convicted of Acts of Lasciviousness under Art. III, Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, in relation to Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and [twenty] 20 days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and; to pay the complainant AAA [P]15,000.00 as fine, [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages and [P]15,000.00 as exemplary damages.In both cases, costs against the appellant.SO ORDERED.[8]The CA sustained the conviction of the accused-appellant after finding that the testimony of AAA was credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. There was no reason to overturn the accused-appellant\u2019s conviction under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape considering that AAA was undeniably under 12 years old and that the accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with her. Furthermore, the CA also found that the acts of accused-appellant fall under the category of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in conjunction with Section 5, R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). However, with respect to the damages, the CA corrected the trial court\u2019s disposition on the matter and specifically awarded civil indemnity automatically upon proof of the commission of the crime, moral damages, and exemplary damages in view of the victim\u2019s minority.Hence, this case.The primary issue in this case is whether or not the accused appellant\u2019s guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt vis-a-vis his main defense that the rape charges were merely concocted to get back at him as leverage against his act of disconnecting the jumper owned by AAA's family.It should be noted that the records of this case were elevated to this Court on December 8, 2010, pursuant to the CA Resolution dated June 23, 2010, which gave due course to the notice of appeal filed by accused- appellant. In compliance with this Court's Resolution dated January 12, 2011, the parties submitted their respective manifestations stating that they are no longer filing Supplemental Briefs with this Court and are adopting all the allegations, issues and arguments adduced in their Briefs before the CA.This Court sustains accused-appellant\u2019s conviction.The law presumes that an accused in a criminal prosecution is innocent until the contrary is proven. This basic constitutional principle is fleshed out by procedural rules which place on the prosecution the burden of proving that an accused is guilty of the offense charged by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Whether the degree of proof has been met is largely left to the trial courts to determine. However, an appeal throws the whole case open for review such that the Court may, and generally does, look into the entire records if only to ensure that no fact of weight or substance has been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the trial court.[9]Courts use the following principles in deciding rape cases: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) due to the nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Due to the nature of this crime, conviction for rape may be solely based on the complainant\u2019s testimony provided it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.[10]After a meticulous review of the records of the instant case, the Court holds that the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.This Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the trial court's appreciation of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses' testimony. Findings of trial court relative to the credibility of the rape victim are normally respected and not disturbed on appeal, more so, if affirmed by the appellate court. This rule may be brushed aside in exceptional circumstances, such as when the court\u2019s evaluation was reached arbitrarily, or when the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied certain facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the case.[11] The assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a domain best left to the trial court judge because of his unique opportunity to observe their deportment and demeanor on the witness stand; a vantage point denied appellate courts - and when his findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court.[12]We quote with approval the following findings of the CA as to the ordeal gone through by AAA in the hands of the appellant, viz:AAA testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner and never wavered in positively identifying appellant as her rapist despite grueling cross-examination. The trial court thus found the testimony of AAA to have been amply corroborated... who bravely, unabashedly, straightforwardly and consistently narrated in court her harrowing ordeal, vexation and pain in the hands of the accused.AAA was categorical in stating that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina: Q: And when the two of you were inside the comfort room of the rice mill, what did the accused do if any? A: He undressed me and then he sat on the toilet bowl, he unzipped his pants and he thereafter placed me on his top. Q: And while he was placing you on his top, what did he do next if any? A: He inserted his penis into my vagina. Q: What did you do or feel when he inserted his penis into your vagina? A: I felt pain sir. xxx xxx Q: And after he inserted his penis into your vagina, and after he told you that, what happened next if any? A: He inserted his finger into my vagina sir. Even on cross, examination AAA was unwavering: Q: And when he sat on the toilet bowl you said he opened his zip? A: Yes, sir. Q: And then he lifted you and then place you on his top, is that correct? A: Yes, sir, Q: And then you felt pain because he was able to insert his penis into your vagina, is that what you mean? A: Yes, sir. Q: Now you would like to tell the Honorable Court that when he lifted you [and] placed you on hi (sic) lap and then at that time his penis entered your vagina? A: Yes, sir. A young girl would not usually concoct a tale of defloration; publicly admit having been ravished and her honor tainted; allow the examination of her private parts; and undergo all the trouble and inconvenience, not to mention the trauma and scandal of a public trial, had she not in fact been raped and been truly moved to protect and preserve her honor, and motivated by the desire to obtain justice for the wicked acts committed against her.x x x xx x x It is well-settled that the presentation of the medico-legal to testify on the examination of the victim and the medical certificate itself are not indispensable in a prosecution for rape. x x xx x x xVerily, AAA was able to prove through her testimony that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina, thereby consummating his intention to have carnal knowledge of her. After all, the prevailing rule is that when a woman of tender age says that she was raped, she has stated everything that is necessary to prove the commission of the crime. x x xx x x xWe find no reason to overturn the conviction of appellant under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape, it having been proven that AAA was under seven years of age when she was raped. The elements thereof had been overwhelmingly established in this case, specifically: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and(2) that the woman was below 12 years of age. On the other hand, the crime of rape by sexual assault was not duly established by the prosecution. x x xx x x xUnder jurisprudential law, a person's tongue can be considered as an 'instrument or object' with which the crime of rape by sexual assault may be perpetrated. In the instant case, however, the record shows that no actual insertion of the tongue was done by appellant to bring the act within coverage of Art. 266-A (2) of the RPC. Not by any stretch of the imagination can the word \u201csuck\u201d be considered as an insertion. Thus, the act complained of cannot be considered rape by sexual assault.Nonetheless, appellant's act falls under the category of crime of Acts of Lasciviousness, as defined under Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code: x x xx x x [I]n conjunction with Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, Section 5 x x x:[13]The accused-appellant\u2019s defense of alibi deserves scant consideration. Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and highly unreliable. To merit approbation, the accused-appellant must adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the situs criminis at the time the crime was committed, such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime when it was committed. Since alibi is a weak defense for being easily fabricated, it cannot prevail over and is worthless in the face of the positive identification by a credible witness that an accused perpetrated the crime.[14]As to the award of damages, this Court, however, believes that the amounts so awarded should be modified in line with existing jurisprudence regarding the amounts thereof such that civil indemnity is reduced to P50,000.00 instead of P75,000.00 while exemplary damages is changed to P30,000.00 instead of P25,000.00.[15] The accused-appellant is further liable for interest of 6% per annum on all the civil damages.WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision dated May 26, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03546 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that in Criminal Case No. T-3682, accused-appellant Antonio Baraoil is ordered to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus interest of 6% per annum on each of the amounts awarded reckoned from the finality of this decision.SO ORDERED.Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Perez, and Sereno, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Antonio L.

The accused-appellant stopped and boarded her to his bicycle and brought her home.\n\nThe next day, DDD asked AAA what happened when she was with the accused-appellant. AAA did not say anything but she started to cry until she told her mother EEE all that transpired. On August 10, 2004, EEE brought AAA to the police station where they reported the incident.\n\nFor the defense, the accused-appellant denied the charges and preferred an alibi by stating that he was with his friend Renato at the fish pond at the time when the alleged rape took place. He claimed that they were fishing from 7:30 to 10:00 in the morning. They also drank gin at around 3:00 p.m. and went home at 4:00 p.m. He, moreover, claimed that AAA was nice to him before the alleged rape. However, AAA's family got mad at him after he disconnected their jumper connection from the power source. They even threatened that they will hack him to death. Thus, the accusation of AAA's family was a means of revenge.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two crimes of rape, respectively defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 8353 amending the Revised Penal Code provisions on rape, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the following:\n\n1. the indeterminate penalty of from (sic) six (6) years of prision correccional maximum as minimum to ten (10) years of prision mayor medium as maximum, for the rape committed as charged in Criminal Case No. T-3683; and,\n\n2. the death sentence of a protracted kind, namely reclusion perpetua, for the rape committed in Criminal Case No. T- 3682.\nPursuant to the stipulations arrived at by the parties at the pre-trial stage, the accused is likewise condemned to indemnify the private complainant for damages in the agreed total sum of [P]200,000.00; and, to pay the costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6]\n\nThe trial court lent credence to the testimony of AAA that she was raped. The trial court found her testimony categorical, straightforward and candid. Moreover, in upholding the credibility of AAA, the trial court relied heavily on established doctrines in rape cases.\n\nOn September 1, 2008, the accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal. [7] The CA, in a Decision dated May 26, 2010, affirmed the accused-appellant's conviction with modification, viz :\n\n1. In Criminal Case No. T-3682, appellant is ordered to pay private complainant AAA, the amounts of [P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]50,000.00 as moral damages and [P]25,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\n2. In Criminal Case No. T-3683, appellant is convicted of Acts of Lasciviousness under Art. III, Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, in relation to Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and [twenty] 20 days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and; to pay the complainant AAA [P]15,000.00 as fine, [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages and [P]15,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nIn both cases, costs against the appellant.\n\nSO ORDERED . [8]\nThe CA sustained the conviction of the accused-appellant after finding that the testimony of AAA was credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. There was no reason to overturn the accused-appellant\u2019s conviction under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape considering that AAA was undeniably under 12 years old and that the accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with her. Furthermore, the CA also found that the acts of accused-appellant fall under the category of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in conjunction with Section 5, R.A. No. 7610 ( Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act ). However, with respect to the damages, the CA corrected the trial court\u2019s disposition on the matter and specifically awarded civil indemnity automatically upon proof of the commission of the crime, moral damages, and exemplary damages in view of the victim\u2019s minority.\n\nHence, this case.\n\nThe primary issue in this case is whether or not the accused appellant\u2019s guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt vis-a-vis his main defense that the rape charges were merely concocted to get back at him as leverage against his act of disconnecting the jumper owned by AAA's family.\n\nIt should be noted that the records of this case were elevated to this Court on December 8, 2010, pursuant to the CA Resolution dated June 23, 2010, which gave due course to the notice of appeal filed by accused- appellant. In compliance with this Court's Resolution dated January 12, 2011, the parties submitted their respective manifestations stating that they are no longer filing Supplemental Briefs with this Court and are adopting all the allegations, issues and arguments adduced in their Briefs before the CA.\n\nThis Court sustains accused-appellant\u2019s conviction.\n\nThe law presumes that an accused in a criminal prosecution is innocent until the contrary is proven. This basic constitutional principle is fleshed out by procedural rules which place on the prosecution the burden of proving that an accused is guilty of the offense charged by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Whether the degree of proof has been met is largely left to the trial courts to determine. However, an appeal throws the whole case open for review such that the Court may, and generally does, look into the entire records if only to ensure that no fact of weight or substance has been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the trial court. [9]\n\nCourts use the following principles in deciding rape cases: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) due to the nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Due to the nature of this crime, conviction for rape may be solely based on the complainant\u2019s testimony provided it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. [10]\n\nAfter a meticulous review of the records of the instant case, the Court holds that the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThis Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the trial court's appreciation of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses' testimony. Findings of trial court relative to the credibility of the rape victim are normally respected and not disturbed on appeal, more so, if affirmed by the appellate court. This rule may be brushed aside in exceptional circumstances, such as when the court\u2019s evaluation was reached arbitrarily, or when the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied certain facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the case. [11] The assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a domain best left to the trial court judge because of his unique opportunity to observe their deportment and demeanor on the witness stand; a vantage point denied appellate courts - and when his findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court. [12]\n\nWe quote with approval the following findings of the CA as to the ordeal gone through by AAA in the hands of the appellant, viz :\n\nAAA testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner and never wavered in positively identifying appellant as her rapist despite grueling cross-examination. The trial court thus found the testimony of AAA to have been amply corroborated... who bravely, unabashedly, straightforwardly and consistently narrated in court her harrowing ordeal, vexation and pain in the hands of the accused.\n\nAAA was categorical in stating that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | And when the two of you were inside the comfort room of the rice mill, what did the accused do if any?\nA: | He undressed me and then he sat on the toilet bowl, he unzipped his pants and he thereafter placed me on his top.\n | \nQ: | And while he was placing you on his top, what did he do next if any?\nA: | He inserted his penis into my vagina.\n | \nQ: | What did you do or feel when he inserted his penis into your vagina?\nA: | I felt pain sir. xxx xxx\n | \nQ: | And after he inserted his penis into your vagina, and after he told you that, what happened next if any?\nA: | He inserted his finger into my vagina sir.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: And when the two of you were inside the comfort room of the rice mill, what did the accused do if any? A: He undressed me and then he sat on the toilet bowl, he unzipped his pants and he thereafter placed me on his top. Q: And while he was placing you on his top, what did he do next if any? A: He inserted his penis into my vagina. Q: What did you do or feel when he inserted his penis into your vagina? A: I felt pain sir. xxx xxx Q: And after he inserted his penis into your vagina, and after he told you that, what happened next if any? A: He inserted his finger into my vagina sir.\nEven on cross, examination AAA was unwavering:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | And when he sat on the toilet bowl you said he opened his zip?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | And then he lifted you and then place you on his top, is that correct?\nA: | Yes, sir,\n | \nQ: | And then you felt pain because he was able to insert his penis into your vagina, is that what you mean?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | Now you would like to tell the Honorable Court that when he lifted you [and] placed you on hi (sic) lap and then at that time his penis entered your vagina?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: And when he sat on the toilet bowl you said he opened his zip? A: Yes, sir. Q: And then he lifted you and then place you on his top, is that correct? A: Yes, sir, Q: And then you felt pain because he was able to insert his penis into your vagina, is that what you mean? A: Yes, sir. Q: Now you would like to tell the Honorable Court that when he lifted you [and] placed you on hi (sic) lap and then at that time his penis entered your vagina? A: Yes, sir.\nA young girl would not usually concoct a tale of defloration; publicly admit having been ravished and her honor tainted; allow the examination of her private parts; and undergo all the trouble and inconvenience, not to mention the trauma and scandal of a public trial, had she not in fact been raped and been truly moved to protect and preserve her honor, and motivated by the desire to obtain justice for the wicked acts committed against her.\n\nx x x x\n\nx x x It is well-settled that the presentation of the medico-legal to testify on the examination of the victim and the medical certificate itself are not indispensable in a prosecution for rape. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nVerily, AAA was able to prove through her testimony that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina, thereby consummating his intention to have carnal knowledge of her. After all, the prevailing rule is that when a woman of tender age says that she was raped, she has stated everything that is necessary to prove the commission of the crime. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nWe find no reason to overturn the conviction of appellant under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape, it having been proven that AAA was under seven years of age when she was raped. The elements thereof had been overwhelmingly established in this case, specifically: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and\n\n(2) that the woman was below 12 years of age. On the other hand, the crime of rape by sexual assault was not duly established by the prosecution. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nUnder jurisprudential law, a person's tongue can be considered as an 'instrument or object' with which the crime of rape by sexual assault may be perpetrated. In the instant case, however, the record shows that no actual insertion of the tongue was done by appellant to bring the act within coverage of Art. 266-A (2) of the RPC. Not by any stretch of the imagination can the word \u201csuck\u201d be considered as an insertion. Thus, the act complained of cannot be considered rape by sexual assault.\n\nNonetheless, appellant's act falls under the category of crime of Acts of Lasciviousness, as defined under Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code: x x x\n\nx x x [I]n conjunction with Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, Section 5 x x x: [13]\nThe accused-appellant\u2019s defense of alibi deserves scant consideration. Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and highly unreliable. To merit approbation, the accused-appellant must adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the situs criminis at the time the crime was committed, such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime when it was committed. Since alibi is a weak defense for being easily fabricated, it cannot prevail over and is worthless in the face of the positive identification by a credible witness that an accused perpetrated the crime. [14]\n\nAs to the award of damages, this Court, however, believes that the amounts so awarded should be modified in line with existing jurisprudence regarding the amounts thereof such that civil indemnity is reduced to P50,000.00 instead of P75,000.00 while exemplary damages is changed to P30,000.00 instead of P25,000.00. [15] The accused-appellant is further liable for interest of 6% per annum on all the civil damages.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed Decision dated May 26, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03546 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that in Criminal Case No. T-3682, accused-appellant Antonio Baraoil is ordered to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus interest of 6% per annum on each of the amounts awarded reckoned from the finality of this decision.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Perez, and Sereno, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Antonio L.

      "title": "PROVINCE OF CAGAYAN, REPRESENTED BY HON. ALVARO T. ANTONIO, GOVERNOR, AND ROBERT ADAP, ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES OFFICER, PETITIONERS, VS. JOSEPH LASAM LARA, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N PERLAS-BERNABE, J.: This is a direct recourse to the Court from the Decision[1] of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 (RTC), through a petition for review on certiorari[2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, raising a pure question of law. In particular, petitioners assail the RTC\u2019s June 30, 2009 Decision in Civil Case No. 7077, enjoining them from disturbing the quarrying operations of respondent Joseph Lasam Lara (Lara).The FactsOn September 14, 2007, Lara obtained an Industrial Sand and Gravel Permit[3] (ISAG Permit) from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), authorizing him to conduct quarrying operations in a twenty-hectare area situated in Barangay Centro, Muncipality of Pe\u00f1ablanca (Pe\u00f1ablanca), Cagayan (Permit Area) and extract and dispose of sand, gravel, and other unconsolidated materials from the Permit Area. For the same purpose, Lara obtained an Environmental Compliance Certificate[4] (ECC) from the DENR Environmental Management Bureau (EMB).[5]On January 3, 2008, Jovy Balisi (Balisi), Lara\u2019s representative, went to the Cagayan Provincial Treasurer\u2019s Office (Treasurer\u2019s Office) to pay the extraction fee and other fees for Lara\u2019s quarrying operations but she was directed to first secure an Order of Payment from the Environmental and Natural Resources Officer, petitioner Robert Adap (ENRO Adap). However, when Balisi went to ENRO Adap, the latter refused to issue an Order of Payment. Despite various pleas from Balisi and Atty. Victorio N. Casauay (Atty. Casauay), Lara\u2019s counsel, ENRO Adap remained adamant with his refusal. This prompted Atty. Casauay to tender and deposit the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office corresponding to the said extraction fee and other related fees.[6]On January 11, 2008, Lara commenced his quarrying operations. Later that day, however, a total of four trucks loaded with sand and gravel extracted from the Permit Area were stopped and impounded by several local officials.[7] Consequently, Lara filed an action for injunction with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 7049, against the said officials, seeking to enjoin the stoppage of his quarrying operations. After due proceedings, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued enabling Lara to restart his business.[8]Nonetheless, on March 17, 2008, Lara received a Stoppage Order[9] dated March 13, 2008 (Stoppage Order) this time from Cagayan Governor Alvaro T. Antonio (Gov. Antonio), directing him to stop his quarrying operations for the following reasons: (a) the ISAG Permit was not in accordance with Republic Act No. (RA) 7942,[10] otherwise known as the \u201cPhilippine Mining Act of 1995,\u201d and its implementing rules and regulations; (b) Lara\u2019s failure to pay sand and gravel fee under Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07; and (c) [Lara\u2019s] failure to secure all necessary permits or clearances from the local government unit concerned as required by the [ECC].[11] Hence, Lara filed the present action for injunction and damages with an urgent and ex-parte motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction before the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 7077.In their Answer dated June 10, 2008, petitioners raised the following defenses: (a) the mere issuance of the ISAG Permit does not give Lara the right to commence his quarrying operations as he still had to comply with the terms and conditions stated therein; (b) Lara has neither secured all the necessary permits nor paid the local fees and taxes; and (c) Gov. Antonio was merely performing his duty to enforce all laws and ordinances relative to the governance of the Province of Cagayan pursuant to the provisions of RA 7160,[12] otherwise known as the \u201cLocal Government Code of 1991.\u201d[13]In an Order[14] dated August 11, 2008, the RTC granted Lara\u2019s application for a writ of preliminary injunction based on a prima facie finding that he is authorized to extract gravel and sand from the Permit Area. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration[15] which was, however denied on September 26, 2008.[16]During the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following facts: (a) that Lara was able to secure an ISAG Permit from the MGB and an ECC from the DENR-EMB; (b) that Lara deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office for the extraction and other related fees; and (c) that Gov. Antonio issued a Stoppage Order directing Lara to stop the quarrying operations in the Permit Area. The parties also determined that the submission of documentary evidence would be sufficient to reach a decision and as such, the RTC directed them to simultaneously file their respective memoranda.[17]The RTC RulingIn a Decision[18] dated June 30, 2009, the RTC made permanent the writ of preliminary injunction and thus, enjoined petitioners from stopping or disturbing Lara\u2019s quarrying operations.It held that Lara legally acquired the right to operate his quarrying business, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC issued by the MGB and the EMB, respectively, which are the government agencies tasked to grant or deny any application for quarrying of industrial sand and gravel.[19] In this regard, the RTC observed that if Gov. Antonio perceived any defect in Lara\u2019s ISAG Permit, the proper recourse would have been to bring the matter to the attention of the MGB and not to issue a Stoppage Order.[20] It further noted that Lara could not pay the extraction and other related fees only because ENRO Adap adamantly refused to issue an Order of Payment. In this relation, the RTC concluded that there was substantial compliance with the requirements since Lara, in good faith, tendered and deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office, which can be treated as Lara\u2019s payment of the pertinent fees.[21] Finally, the RTC found no need to touch on the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit before starting his quarrying operations, given that it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, pending before the same court.[22]Aggrieved, petitioners sought direct recourse to the Court via the instant petition.The Issue Before the CourtThe primordial issue raised for the Court\u2019s resolution is whether the RTC properly issued the permanent injunction subject of this case.Among others, petitioners argue that despite the issuance of the ISAG Permit, Lara has yet to comply with its terms and conditions \u2013 as he has yet to secure the necessary permits and clearances from the local government unit concerned \u2013 and hence, remains to be proscribed from conducting any quarrying operations.[23]On the other hand, Lara maintains that the MGB and DENR-EMB had already authorized him to extract sand and gravel from the Permit Area, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC, thereby dispensing with the need to secure any permit from the local government. In any case, he contends that the only reason why he failed to secure such permits was because the local government officials deliberately refused to process his applications without any legitimate reason whatsoever.[24]The Court\u2019s RulingThe petition is meritorious.It is well-settled that a writ of injunction would issue upon the satisfaction of two (2) requisites, namely: (a) the existence of a right to be protected; and (b) acts which are violative of the said right. In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive relief constitutes grave abuse of discretion. Injunction is not designed to protect contingent or future rights. Where the complainant\u2019s right is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of actual existing right is not a ground for an injunction.[25]In order for an entity to legally undertake a quarrying business, he must first comply with all the requirements imposed not only by the national government, but also by the local government unit where his business is situated. Particularly, Section 138(2) of RA 7160[26] requires that such entity must first secure a governor\u2019s permit prior to the start of his quarrying operations, viz:SECTION 138. Tax on Sand, Gravel and Other Quarry Resources. \u2013 x x x.The permit to extract sand, gravel and other quarry resources shall be issued exclusively by the provincial governor, pursuant to the ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)x x x xIn connection thereto, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cagayan promulgated Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07, Article H, Section 2H.04 of which provides:SECTION 2H.04. Permit for Gravel and Sand Extraction and Quarrying. \u2013 No person shall extract ordinary stones, gravel, earth, boulders and quarry resources from public lands or from the beds of seas, rivers, streams, creeks or other public waters unless a permit has been issued by the Governor (or his deputy as provided herein) x x x. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)A plain reading of the afore-cited provisions clearly shows that a governor\u2019s permit is a pre-requisite before one can engage in a quarrying business in Cagayan. Records, however, reveal that Lara admittedly failed to secure the same; hence, he has no right to conduct his quarrying operations within the Permit Area. Consequently, he is not entitled to any injunction.In view of the foregoing, the Court need not delve into the issue respecting the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit, especially since it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, which remains pending before the court a quo.WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the June 30, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 in Civil Case No. 7077 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.SO ORDERED.Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo, and Perez, JJ., concur.[1] Rollo, pp. 41-50.

JOSEPH LASAM LARA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nPERLAS-BERNABE, J.:\n\nThis is a direct recourse to the Court from the Decision [1] of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 (RTC), through a petition for review on certiorari [2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, raising a pure question of law. In particular, petitioners assail the RTC\u2019s June 30, 2009\u00a0 Decision in Civil Case No. 7077, enjoining them from disturbing the quarrying operations of respondent Joseph Lasam Lara (Lara).\n\nThe Facts\nOn September 14, 2007, Lara obtained an Industrial Sand and Gravel Permit [3] (ISAG Permit) from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), authorizing him to conduct quarrying operations in a twenty-hectare area situated in Barangay Centro, Muncipality of Pe\u00f1ablanca (Pe\u00f1ablanca), Cagayan (Permit Area) and extract and dispose of sand, gravel, and other unconsolidated materials from the Permit Area. For the same purpose, Lara obtained an Environmental Compliance Certificate [4] (ECC) from the DENR Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). [5]\n\nOn January 3, 2008, Jovy Balisi (Balisi), Lara\u2019s representative, went to the Cagayan Provincial Treasurer\u2019s Office (Treasurer\u2019s Office) to pay the extraction fee and other fees for Lara\u2019s quarrying operations but she was directed to first secure an Order of Payment from the Environmental and Natural Resources Officer, petitioner Robert Adap (ENRO Adap). However, when Balisi went to ENRO Adap, the latter refused to issue an Order of Payment. Despite various pleas from Balisi and Atty. Victorio N. Casauay (Atty. Casauay), Lara\u2019s counsel, ENRO Adap remained adamant with his refusal. This prompted Atty. Casauay to tender and deposit the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office corresponding to the said extraction fee and other related fees. [6]\n\nOn January 11, 2008, Lara commenced his quarrying operations. Later that day, however, a total of four trucks loaded with sand and gravel extracted from the Permit Area were stopped and impounded by several local officials. [7] Consequently, Lara filed an action for injunction with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 7049, against the said officials, seeking to enjoin the stoppage of his quarrying operations. After due proceedings, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued enabling Lara to restart his business. [8]\n\nNonetheless, on March 17, 2008, Lara received a Stoppage Order [9] dated March 13, 2008 (Stoppage Order) this time from Cagayan Governor Alvaro T. Antonio (Gov. Antonio), directing him to stop his quarrying operations for the following reasons: (a) the ISAG Permit was not in accordance with Republic Act No. (RA) 7942, [10] otherwise known as the \u201cPhilippine Mining Act of 1995,\u201d and its implementing rules and regulations; (b) Lara\u2019s failure to pay sand and gravel fee under Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07; and (c) [Lara\u2019s] failure to secure all necessary permits or clearances from the local government unit concerned as required by the [ECC]. [11] Hence, Lara filed the present action for injunction and damages with an urgent and ex-parte motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction before the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 7077.\n\nIn their Answer dated June 10, 2008, petitioners raised the following defenses: ( a ) the mere issuance of the ISAG Permit does not give Lara the right to commence his quarrying operations as he still had to comply with the terms and conditions stated therein; ( b ) Lara has neither secured all the necessary permits nor paid the local fees and taxes; and ( c ) Gov. Antonio was merely performing his duty to enforce all laws and ordinances relative to the governance of the Province of Cagayan pursuant to the provisions of RA 7160, [12] otherwise known as the \u201cLocal Government Code of 1991.\u201d [13]\n\nIn an Order [14] dated August 11, 2008, the RTC granted Lara\u2019s application for a writ of preliminary injunction based on a prima facie finding that he is authorized to extract gravel and sand from the Permit Area. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration [15] which was, however denied on September 26, 2008. [16]\n\nDuring the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following facts: ( a ) that Lara was able to secure an ISAG Permit from the MGB and an ECC from the DENR-EMB; ( b ) that Lara deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office for the extraction and other related fees; and ( c ) that Gov. Antonio issued a Stoppage Order directing Lara to stop the quarrying operations in the Permit Area. The parties also determined that the submission of documentary evidence would be sufficient to reach a decision and as such, the RTC directed them to simultaneously file their respective memoranda. [17]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\nIn a Decision [18] dated June 30, 2009, the RTC made permanent the writ of preliminary injunction and thus, enjoined petitioners from stopping or disturbing Lara\u2019s quarrying operations.\n\nIt held that Lara legally acquired the right to operate his quarrying business, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC issued by the MGB and the EMB, respectively, which are the government agencies tasked to grant or deny any application for quarrying of industrial sand and gravel. [19] In this regard, the RTC observed that if Gov. Antonio perceived any defect in Lara\u2019s ISAG Permit, the proper recourse would have been to bring the matter to the attention of the MGB and not to issue a Stoppage Order. [20] It further noted that Lara could not pay the extraction and other related fees only because ENRO Adap adamantly refused to issue an Order of Payment. In this relation, the RTC concluded that there was substantial compliance with the requirements since Lara, in good faith, tendered and deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office, which can be treated as Lara\u2019s payment of the pertinent fees. [21] Finally, the RTC found no need to touch on the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit before starting his quarrying operations, given that it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, pending before the same court. [22]\n\nAggrieved, petitioners sought direct recourse to the Court via the instant petition.\n\nThe Issue Before the Court\nThe primordial issue raised for the Court\u2019s resolution is whether the RTC properly issued the permanent injunction subject of this case.\n\nAmong others, petitioners argue that despite the issuance of the ISAG Permit, Lara has yet to comply with its terms and conditions \u2013 as he has yet to secure the necessary permits and clearances from the local government unit concerned \u2013 and hence, remains to be proscribed from conducting any quarrying operations. [23]\n\nOn the other hand, Lara maintains that the MGB and DENR-EMB had already authorized him to extract sand and gravel from the Permit Area, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC, thereby dispensing with the need to secure any permit from the local government. In any case, he contends that the only reason why he failed to secure such permits was because the local government officials deliberately refused to process his applications without any legitimate reason whatsoever. [24]\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nIt is well-settled that a writ of injunction would issue upon the satisfaction of two (2) requisites, namely: ( a ) the existence of a right to be protected; and ( b ) acts which are violative of the said right. In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive relief constitutes grave abuse of discretion. Injunction is not designed to protect contingent or future rights. Where the complainant\u2019s right is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of actual existing right is not a ground for an injunction. [25]\n\nIn order for an entity to legally undertake a quarrying business, he must first comply with all the requirements imposed not only by the national government, but also by the local government unit where his business is situated. Particularly, Section 138(2) of RA 7160 [26] requires that such entity must first secure a governor\u2019s permit prior to the start of his quarrying operations, viz:\n\nSECTION 138. Tax on Sand, Gravel and Other Quarry Resources. \u2013 x x x.\n\nThe permit to extract sand, gravel and other quarry resources shall be issued exclusively by the provincial governor , pursuant to the ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nx x x x\nIn connection thereto, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cagayan promulgated Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07, Article H, Section 2H.04 of which provides:\n\nSECTION 2H.04. Permit for Gravel and Sand Extraction and Quarrying . \u2013 No person shall extract ordinary stones, gravel, earth, boulders and quarry resources from public lands or from the beds of seas, rivers, streams, creeks or other public waters unless a permit has been issued by the Governor (or his deputy as provided herein) x x x. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nA plain reading of the afore-cited provisions clearly shows that a governor\u2019s permit is a pre-requisite before one can engage in a quarrying business in Cagayan. Records, however, reveal that Lara admittedly failed to secure the same; hence, he has no right to conduct his quarrying operations within the Permit Area. Consequently, he is not entitled to any injunction.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court need not delve into the issue respecting the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit, especially since it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, which remains pending before the court a quo .\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . Accordingly, the June 30, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 in Civil Case No. 7077 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo , and Perez, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 41-50.

No. 9881 (Formerly CBD 10-2607), June 04, 2014 ]\n[ A.C. No. 9881 (Formerly CBD 10-2607), June 04, 2014 ]\n\nATTY. ALAN F. PAGUIA, PETITIONER, VS. ATTY. MANUEL T. MOLINA, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N\nATTY. ALAN F. PAGUIA, PETITIONER, VS. ATTY. MANUEL T. MOLINA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nSERENO, C.J.:\n\nFor resolution by this Court is the dismissal by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Board of Governors of the administrative Complaint for DISHONESTY against respondent, Atty. Manuel Molina. Atty. Molina allegedly advised his clients to enforce a contract on the complainant\u2019s client who had never been a party to the agreement.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\nThe case involves a conflict between neighbors in a four-unit compound named \u201cTimes Square\u201d at Times Street, Quezon City. The neighbors are the following: 1) Mr. And Mrs. Gregorio M. Abreu, clients of Atty. Paguia; 2) Mr. And Mrs. Wilson Lim, clients of respondent Molina; 3) Dr. and Mrs. Eduardo Yap; and Dr. Belinda San Juan.\n\nThe clients of Atty. Molina entered into a contract with the other unit owners save for Mr. Abreu. The agreement, covered by a document titled \u201cTimes Square Preamble,\u201d establishes a set of internal rules for the neighbors on matters such as the use of the common right of way to the exit gate, assignment of parking areas, and security. Mr. Abreu, the client of complainant, Atty. Paguia, was not a party to the contract since the former did not agree with the terms concerning the parking arrangements.\n\nOn 4 February 2010, Atty. Paguia filed a Complaint for Dishonesty [1] with the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline against Atty. Molina [2] for allegedly giving legal advice to the latter\u2019s clients to the effect that the Times Square Preamble was binding on Mr. Abreu, who was never a party to the contract.\n\nIn his Answer, [3] Atty. Molina downplayed the case as a petty quarrel among neighbors. He maintained that the Times Square Preamble [4] was entered into for purposes of maintaining order in the residential compound. All homeowners, except Mr. Abreu, signed the document. [5]\n\nRespondent further stated in his Answer that Mr. and Mrs. Gregorio Abreu filed two cases against his clients, Mr. And Mrs. William Lim, on the belief that Mr. Abreu was not bound by the Times Square Preamble. The first case, was filed with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), which was an action to declare the Times Square Preamble invalid. The second suit was an action for declaratory relief. Both cases, according to respondent, were dismissed. [6]\n\nRespondent further claimed that another case had been filed in court, this time by his client, the Lims.\u00a0 They were prompted to file a suit since Mr. Abreu had allegedly taken matters into his own hands by placing two vehicles directly in front of the gate of the Lims, thus blocking the latter\u2019s egress to Times Street. The Lims filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 96, Quezon City, a Complaint for Injunction and Damages, coupled with a prayer for the immediate issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction, which was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-08-63579. According to respondent, the RTC granted the relief prayed for in an Order dated 12 December 2008. [7]\n\nAtty. Molina concluded that the above facts sufficiently served as his answer to the Complaint.\n\nOn 3 August 2010, Investigating Commissioner Victor C. Fernandez rendered a Report and Recommendation. He recommended dismissal for lack of merit, based on the following grounds: 1) the complaint consisted only of bare allegations; and 2) even assuming that respondent Molina gave an erroneous legal advice, he could not be held accountable in the absence of proof of malice or bad faith. [8]\n\nOn 14 May 2011, the IBP Board of Governors passed Resolution No. XIX-2011-210, adopting and approving the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner. [9]\n\nAtty. Paguia filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated 2 August 2011, but was denied by the IBP Board of Governors on 29 December 2012. [10] Notices of the denial were received by the parties on 21 March 2013. [11]\n\nNo petition for review has been filed with this Court.\n\nIt is worth noting that a case is deemed terminated if the complainant does not file a petition with the Supreme Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board\u2019s resolution. This rule is derived from Section 12(c) of Rule 139-B, which states:\n\n(c) If the respondent is exonerated by the Board or the disciplinary sanction imposed by it is less than suspension or disbarment (such as admonition, reprimand, or fine) it shall issue a decision exonerating respondent or imposing such sanction. The case shall be deemed terminated unless upon petition of the complainant or other interested party filed with the Supreme Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board\u2019s resolution, the Supreme Court orders otherwise . (Underscoring supplied)\nIn this case, Atty. Paguia received notice of the Board\u2019s resolution on 21 March 2013, as evidenced by a registry return receipt. To this date, this Court has yet to receive a petition for review from Atty. Paguia. Thus, for his failure to file a petition for review with the Court within 15 days, this case is deemed terminated pursuant to the above mentioned Section 12(c).\n\nNevertheless, we have gone over the records but we have no reason to deviate from the findings of the IBP Board of Governors.\n\nWhen it comes to administrative cases against lawyers, two things are to be considered: quantum of proof, which requires clearly preponderant evidence; and burden of proof, which is on the complainant. [12]\n\nIn the present case, we find that the Complaint is without factual basis. Complainant Atty. Paguia charges Atty. Molina with providing legal advice to the latter\u2019s clients to the effect that the Times Square Preamble is binding on complainant\u2019s client, Mr. Abreu, who was not a signatory to the agreement. The allegation of giving legal advice, however, was not substantiated in this case, either in the complaint or in the corresponding hearings. Nowhere do the records state that Atty. Paguia saw respondent giving the legal advice to the clients of the latter. Bare allegations are not proof. [13]\n\nEven if we assume that Atty. Molina did provide his clients legal advice, he still cannot be held administratively liable without any showing that his act was attended with bad faith or malice. The rule on mistakes committed by lawyers in the exercise of their profession is as follows:\n\nAn attorney-at-law is not expected to know all the law. For an honest mistake or error, an attorney is not liable . Chief Justice Abbott said that, no attorney is bound to know all the law; God forbid that it should be imagined that an attorney or a counsel, or even a judge, is bound to know all the law. x x x. [14]\nThe default rule is presumption of good faith. On the other hand, bad faith is never presumed. It is a conclusion to be drawn from facts. Its determination is thus a question of fact and is evidentiary. [15] There is no evidence, though, to show that the legal advice, assuming it was indeed given, was coupled with bad faith, malice, or ill-will. The presumption of good faith, therefore, stands in this case.\n\nThe foregoing considered, complainant failed to prove his case by clear preponderance of evidence.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Resolution of the IBP Board of Governors adopting and approving the Decision of the Investigating Commissioner is hereby AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nLeonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, Villarama, Jr. , and Reyes, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Docketed as CBD Case No. 10-2607.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 2-7.\n\n[3] Id at 23-27; Filed on 5 March 2010.\n\n[4] Id. at 8-14.\n\n[5] Id. at 24.

Villasor ( ACA Villasor ), regarding an incident between Process Server Salvador Toriaga ( Toriaga ) and Garcia.\n\nConsidering that the cases were all related as they essentially involved the same parties, issues and causes of action, they were ordered to be consolidated for expediency and exhaustive determination.\n\nA.M. No. P-09-2691 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 09-3040-P)\n\nIn his letter-complaint, Garcia charged his co-workers, Clerk of Court IV Monalisa A. Buencamino ( Atty. Buencamino ) with Misconduct; Records Officer I Jovita P. Flores ( Flores ) with Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and Falsification of Public Document; and Process Server Salvador F. Toriaga ( Toriaga ) with Conduct Unbecoming of a Court Employee. Garcia specifically alleged the following:\n\nDespite being on leave from September 1-5, 2008, Atty. Buencamino still officially placed the remarks such as \u201cout of office\u201d and \u201csleeping during office hours\u201d on their bundy cards for the month of September 2008.\n\nAs Records Officer II, Flores was responsible for signing and issuing court clearances. Flores, however, often left the office without permission. Thus, she made \u201cpre-signed\u201d court clearances making it appear that the court continued to issue the said clearances even when she was out of the office. More specifically, on September 19, 2007 between 1:00-2:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Flores\u2019 signature appeared in some of the court clearances despite the fact that she was at the Supreme Court, attending to her loan and only came back to the office at around 2:50 o\u2019clock in the same afternoon.\n\nToriaga exhibited acts which were unbecoming of a court employee in an incident that happened on September 19, 2008, as detailed in Garcia\u2019s letter [3] to Honorable Judge Bien, dated October 27, 2008 as follows:\n\u201c Humigit kumulang alas kwatro ng hapon habang ako ay nasa loob ng tanggapan ng Clerk of Court at nagtatrabaho, dumating at pumasok sa loob ng tanggapan itong si Salvador Toriaga lasing na lasing, nagsisigaw at nagwawala! Saglit lang at siya\u2019y nanlilisik ang mga matang nakatingin sa akin at ako\u2019y kanyang pinagmumura ng PUTANG INA MO, IKAW PARE, PUTANG INA MO! TUMATAE KA DIMO NILILINIS ANG KUBETA! PUTANG INA MO! Napamulagat ako sa aking kinauupuan dahil hindi ko akalain na sa akin pala galit na galit itong si Salvador Toriaga. Dugtong pa ni Salvador Toriaga \u201cPUTANG INA MO ME DALA AKONG BARIL, ME DALA AKO, LUMABAS KA, LUMABAS KA DIYAN! Sa puntong iyon ay halos nakapaikot na sa kanya ang mga empleyado ng tanggapan at ako naman ay tatayo sa aking pagkakaupo upang siya ay kausapin. Ngunit mabilis siyang nakahagilap ng \u201cstapler\u201d at ako\u2019y susugurin. Sa tagpong \u2018yon ay mabilis naman siyang nahawakan ng kanyang anak, ng guwardiyang si Catadman at ng ilang empleyado, at siya\u2019y kinaladkad papalabas. Habang papalabas sumigaw uli siya ng \u2018HINDI AKO TAKOT MAWALA SA OPISINA! HAYUP KA ME ARAW KA RIN SA AKIN\u201d Matapos siyang mailabas ng tanggapan, ako namay naupos na parang kandila dahilan sa nerbiyos. Alam kong tumaas ang presyon ng aking dugo kaya\u2019y akoy namahinga ng ilang minuto bago umakyat sa Executive Judge.\u201d [4]\nIn her Comment, [5] Atty. Buencamino denied the allegations against her and averred that the comments/annotations on the bundy card/daily time record of Garcia and his common-law wife, Honeylee Gatbunton-Guevarra ( Guevarra ), as well as of all the court personnel was a method to stop erring court employees from further wrongdoings such as sleeping, loafing or missing, playing computer games, doing nothing, cooking during office hours and other acts in violation of the civil service and Supreme Court rules and regulations or circulars. Atty. Buencamino also claimed having instructed her staff and other persons to list all court employees of the Office of the Clerk of Court ( OCC ) of their whereabouts, what they were doing and those sleeping during office hours at the time/period she was on leave. If those instructed could not write their reports on the logbook or journal, then she would be the one to write them upon her return to work.\n\nAtty. Buencamino further alleged that Garcia showed little concern for time lost from work as he was a habitual absentee, late comer, lazy, and indifferent. He did nothing everyday while listening to his music with headphone attached to his head and ears, slept during office hours, placed/piled the docket and records so high in order to hide while sleeping or doing nothing, and wore sunglasses inside the office in order not to get detected that he was already sleeping. She also averred that Garcia would be missing during office hours to go home and take care of his three (3) children with Guevarra\u00a0 and come back before office hours ended. [6] Atty. Buencamino claimed that the attitude, conduct and behavior of Garcia had fallen short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the administration of justice. [7]\n\nInsofar as the complaints against Toriaga and Flores were concerned, Atty. Buencamino claimed that Toriaga never complained about his work for 19 years and that he was not a quarrelsome person. Flores, on the other hand, had never issued pre-signed court clearances because she herself would not allow such act. The clearances marked as Annexes \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d and \u201cE\u201d were signed by Flores only after her return to the office, contrary to Garcia\u2019s allegations, and for the reason that the latter, being the officer next in rank authorized to sign court clearances, refused to sign them and told one Edwin Cara ( Cara ) to wait for the return of Flores. [8]\n\nOn her part, Flores alleged in her Comment [9] that upon her return to the office at around 2:50 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Cara presented to her the court clearances which did not bear any signature of any Records Officer I or any person next in rank to her. Attached to her comment was Cara\u2019s affidavit [10] to prove that she did not sign any blank form or pre-signed court clearances, contrary to Garcia\u2019s claim. Flores also averred that she had witnessed the confrontational incident between Garcia and Toriaga on September 19, 2008 and that Toriaga did not utter any threatening words or carry any gun. [11]\n\nFurthermore, Flores claimed that Garcia was one of their erring court employees who were always caught sleeping, loafing or missing, and doing nothing during office hours. [12]\n\nIn like manner, Toriaga, in his Comment, [13] denied Garcia\u2019s allegations against him and claimed that he did not threaten Garcia or bring any gun to work, as likewise contained by the report [14] of the building\u2019s security guard. He, however, admitted that he and Garcia shouted and hurled invectives at each other. Because of the said incident, they were called by Executive Judge Bien to settle things between them. As no settlement took place, they were asked to submit their respective written explanations. [15] Toriaga also mentioned having previously reported another misconduct of Garcia relating to the latter\u2019s misuse of their office comfort room to their other superiors namely: David Maniquis (Clerk of Court III), Rowena Ruiz (Administrative Officer II), Ferdinand Santos (Clerk III), Edwin Cara (Process Server) and Liza Macasaquit (Records Officer I-Appeal Cases), but no action was taken by any of them as they did not want to intervene. [16]\n\nToriaga also corroborated the claims of Atty. Buencamino and Flores regarding Garcia\u2019s behavior during office hours and that Garcia and Guevarra, who was married, were publicly known to be living together and had three (3) children; that Atty. Buencamino\u2019s comments on the logbook/journal and bundy card of Garcia were true; and that Flores did not sign any blank or make any pre-signed court clearances. [17]\n\nA.M. No. P-09-2687 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 09-3093-P)\n\nThis case arose from the formal letter [18] sent by Judge Bien to ACA Villasor where she reported the September 19, 2008 incident between Garcia and Toriaga. Allegedly, Toriaga got irked by Garcia\u2019s manner of using their office\u2019s comfort room, and out of anger, he went home and drank liquor. He then returned to the office and confronted Garcia. A shouting match between the two ensued.\n\nJudge Bien endeavored to talk to both parties immediately after the incident, but Toriaga already left the office premises and took a month-long leave of absence. Upon the latter\u2019s return to work on October 20, 2008, efforts were exerted to have the parties settle the matter amicably, but to no avail. [19]\n\nAttached to Judge Bien\u2019s letter were the report [20] of the security guard on-duty at the time of the incident and the respective statements [21] of Garcia and Toriaga.\n\nUpon receipt by the Office of the Court Administrator ( OCA ) of Judge Bien\u2019s formal letter, then Court Administrator (now Associate Justice) Jose P. Perez sent a notice [22] to Garcia and Toriaga requiring them to manifest their intentions to submit the case for evaluation by the said office. Toriaga submitted his letter [23] narrating the incident, while Garcia\u2019s letter [24] confirmed the submission of the case for evaluation and prayed for its early resolution.\n\nSubsequently, the Court in its Resolution, [25] dated September 2, 2009, upon the Court Administrator\u2019s recommendation, resolved to re-docket the complaint as a regular administrative matter and referred the same to the Executive Judge for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nA.M. No. P-14-3247 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 09-3238-P)\n\nThis case was an offshoot of the respective comments submitted by Atty. Buencamino, Flores and Toriaga on Garcia\u2019s complaint against them. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s Resolution, [26] dated September 9, 2009, upon the OCA\u2019s recommendation, the charges and counter-charges contained in the aforementioned comments were treated and docketed as a separate administrative complaint against Garcia and his alleged common-law wife, Guevarra. Pieces of evidence were submitted to prove the immoral relationship between the two and the infractions that both had committed, in violation of the existing rules and regulations, circulars and laws of the Civil Service Commission and of the Supreme Court. More specifically, Garcia was charged with habitual absenteeism and violation of office rules, while Garcia and Guevarra were charged with immorality for their common-law relationship, which relationship was of public knowledge.\n\nConsolidated Comment by Garcia and Guevarra\n\nIn their Consolidated Comment, [27] dated December 2, 2009, Garcia and Guevarra merely denied all the charges against them for being malicious, fabricated and baseless. It was their contention that Atty. Buencamino\u2019s act of placing the remarks on their Daily Time Record (DTR) constituted conduct unbecoming of an employee of the court. They emphasized that Atty. Buencamino was one of those previously found guilty of dishonesty and conduct unbecoming of a public servant in A.M. No. P-07-2352 Ireneo Garcia, et al. vs. Monalisa Buencamino and\u00a0 A.M. No. P-07-2353 Atty. Monalisa Buencamino vs. Ireneo Garcia, et al., where Atty. Buencamino was reprimanded and fined.\n\nAs to the alleged immoral relationship, Garcia and Guevarra categorically denied such imputation and averred that the relationship between them was purely official in character and that Guevarra was very much married to her husband, Rolando Guevarra, with whom she has two (2) children. [28]\n\nFindings and Recommendation of the Investigating Judge\n\nIn the September 9, 2009 Resolution [29] of the Court, the administrative cases were referred to Executive Judge Thelma Canlas Trinidad-Pe Aguirre ( Judge Aguirre ) of the Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City ( RTC ), for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nThus, on July 4, 2013, a resolution [30] in A.M. No. P-09-2691 was issued by Judge Aguirre recommending the dismissal of the complaints against Atty. Buencamino and Flores. Garcia testified that he did not see Atty. Buencamino place the remarks being complained by him on the specified dates on his DTR. He also admitted having no knowledge whether Flores filed a leave of absence. Garcia also testified not seeing Flores sign the clearances. [31]\n\nInsofar as Toriaga was concerned, Judge Aguirre recommended the imposition of the penalty of one (1) month suspension from office without pay for misbehavior, to serve as a deterrent to others. Garcia was meted out the penalty of suspension from office for one (1) month without pay for the inappropriate use of the office comfort room and for shouting invectives at Toriaga within the office premises. [32] These same findings and recommendation were made by Judge Aguirre in A.M. No. P-09-2687 , inasmuch as the facts of the case were identical. [33]\n\nOn July 10, 2013, another resolution [34] in A.M. No. P-14-3247 was issued by Judge Aguirre recommending the dismissal of the complaint against Garcia and Guevarra due to insufficient grounds for indictment. It was Judge Aguirre\u2019s conclusion that Atty. Buencamino was guilty of laches. The alleged wrongdoings of Garcia happened way back in 2008, and yet, Atty. Buencamino did not act on them. It was only a means of Atty. Buencamino to get even with Garcia for filing a complaint against her. [35]\n\nEvaluation and\nRecommendation of the\nOffice of the Court Administrator\nThe OCA agreed with the findings of Judge Aguirre in A.M. No. P-09-2691 and A.M. No. P-09-2687 and concluded that the recommendations made by the investigating judge were in order.\n\nThe OCA, however, concluded otherwise with respect to A.M. No. P-14-3247. Contrary to Judge Aguirre\u2019s ratiocination, the OCA stressed that it should not be whether a complainant had a motive in filing the complaint (to get even with a respondent who first filed a complaint against him, or the parties had a grudge against each other), but rather, it should be whether there was ample basis in law and evidence to hold a respondent liable for any offense. Consequently, the OCA found documentary and testimonial evidence showing that Garcia and Guevarra were remiss in their duties, which Garcia did not adequately refute. Further, the amorous affair between Garcia and Guevarra having been established, they could be held liable for immorality. The marriage certificate of Guevarra and the birth certificate of at least one of her purported three (3) children with Garcia were incontrovertible proof of such an illicit relationship. Nonetheless, the OCA opined that any neglect of duty on the part of the respondents would merely be an aggravating circumstance of the grave offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct, pursuant to the Civil Service Rules. [36]\n\nTherefore, the OCA recommended the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | the complaint against respondents Atty. Monalisa A. Buencamino, Clerk of Court IV and Jovita P.

Buencamino be DIRECTED to take appropriate action to ensure and maintain an efficient, effective and harmonious working relationship among all personnel in her office. [37]\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe Court adopts with modification the recommendations of the OCA.\n\nPublic service requires integrity and discipline. For this reason, public servants must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and dedication to duty. By the very nature of their duties and responsibilities, government employees must faithfully adhere to, hold sacred and render inviolate the constitutional principle that a public office is a public trust; that all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency. [38] Improper behavior, especially during office hours, exhibits not only a paucity of professionalism at the workplace, but also great disrespect for the court itself. Such demeanor is a failure of circumspection demanded of every public official and employee. [39]\n\nInsofar as the September 19, 2008 shouting incident is concerned, neither Garcia nor Toriaga denied it. In fact, Toriaga admitted hurling invectives against Garcia for the latter\u2019s improper use of their office comfort room. Garcia, on the other hand, did not refute the said imputation, but complained against the misbehavior displayed by Toriaga.\n\nIn De Vera, Jr. v. Rimando , [40] the Court held that the act of engaging in a shouting match, one even cursing the other, within the court premises, is censurable, to say the least. Court employees are supposed to be well-mannered, civil and considerate in their actuations, in their relations with both co-workers and the transacting public. Boorishness, foul language and any misbehavior in court premises diminishes its sanctity and dignity. [41]\n\nThe OCA, thus, was correct in finding Garcia and Toriaga both guilty for simple misconduct. Simple misconduct is defined as an unacceptable behavior which transgresses the established rules of conduct for public officers, work-related or not. [42] Although Garcia had committed an impropriety relating to the use of the office lavatory, it was not a license for Toriaga to make such outbursts during office hours and within the office premises. Clearly, both employees failed to live up to the high standards of propriety and decorum expected of employees of the Judiciary. [43] It must be stressed that, as employees connected with the administration of justice, discharge of the most exacting standards of conduct are required of them.\n\nAs regards Garcia\u2019s alleged habitual absenteeism, loafing and sleeping during office hours are concerned, the OCA failed to include in their recommendations the corresponding sanction for any finding of neglect of duty, although the OCA has clearly mentioned in its report [44] that:\n\nxxx On the contrary, there were documentary and testimonial evidence showing that respondents Garcia and Guevarra were remiss in their duties and that respondent Garcia was observed to be loafing and sleeping during office hours which he did not adequately refute. Nonetheless, any neglect of duty on their part would merely be an aggravating circumstance of the grave offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct. xxx [45]\n\nWhile the OCA correctly observed that Garcia had been loafing and sleeping during office hours, these acts, however, constitute two separate offenses as they are not embraced under the offense of neglect of duty. Loafing, just like frequent unauthorized absences, is a grave offense while sleeping during office hours, an act violative of office rules and regulations, is a light offense. More appropriately, Garcia was guilty of loafing for which the rules impose a penalty of suspension from work for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, dismissal for the second, [46] as well as violation of reasonable office rules and regulations with reprimand as the penalty for the first offense. [47] It must be remembered that by reason of the nature and functions of the judiciary, its employees must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional canon that public office is a public trust. Inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service, if only to recompense the government, and ultimately the people who shoulder the cost of maintaining the Judiciary. [48]\n\nAside from loafing and sleeping during office hours, Garcia also frequently absented himself from work. More specifically, he had incurred unauthorized absences as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n2008: | \nMay 8, 23, 26, 29 and 30 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[49]\nJuly 7, 22, 25, 28-29, 31[50] | - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate[51]\nAugust 1, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20, 28-29 | - 10 days sick leave, without medical certificate[52]\n2009: | \nMarch 2, 4, 11, 18, 1920 (\u00bd day), 23 (\u00bd day) | - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate[53]\nJuly 3, 15, 27-29 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[54]\nSeptember 15, 22, 23, 28-29 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[55]\n2010: | \nApril 14-16, 19-21, 26-27 | - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate[56]\nJuly 1-2, 7-9, 12-13, 15-16, 21, 23, 26-30 | - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate[57]\nOctober 7, 8 (\u00bd day), 11-14, 22 | - 6.5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[58]\n2011: | \nFebruary | - 8 days sick leave, without medical certificate[59]\nMarch 1, 3-4, 7, 14-1522-24 | - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate[60]\nMay 5, 9, 11-13, 17, 23 | - 7 days sick leave, without medical certificate[61]\nJune 7-10, 13-17, 22, 24, 28 | - 12 days sick leave, without medical certificate[62]\nAugust 1, 7-8, 28-29 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[63]\nOctober 5-7, 10-11 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[64]\nDecember 6-9, 13-14, 16, 20-23, 26-29 | - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate[65]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n2008: May 8, 23, 26, 29 and 30 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [49] July 7, 22, 25, 28-29, 31 [50] - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate [51] August 1, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20, 28-29 - 10 days sick leave, without medical certificate [52] 2009: March 2, 4, 11, 18, 19\n20 (\u00bd day), 23 (\u00bd day) - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate [53] July 3, 15, 27-29 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [54] September 15, 22, 23, 28-29 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [55] 2010: April 14-16, 19-21, 26-27 - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate [56] July 1-2, 7-9, 12-13, 15-16, 21, 23, 26-30 - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate [57] October 7, 8 (\u00bd day), 11-14, 22 - 6.5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [58] 2011: February - 8 days sick leave, without medical certificate [59] March 1, 3-4, 7, 14-15\n22-24 - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate [60] May 5, 9, 11-13, 17, 23 - 7 days sick leave, without medical certificate [61] June 7-10, 13-17, 22, 24, 28 - 12 days sick leave, without medical certificate [62] August 1, 7-8, 28-29 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [63] October 5-7, 10-11 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [64] December 6-9, 13-14, 16, 20-23, 26-29 - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate [65]\nAdministrative Circular No. 14-2002 provides that an officer or employee in the civil service shall be considered habitually absent if he incurs unauthorized absences exceeding the allowable 2.5 days monthly leave credit under the law for at least three (3) months in a semester or at least three (3) consecutive months during the year. Garcia filed applications for sick leave for the absences he had incurred. Said applications, however, were not accompanied by any medical certificate and, thus, the subject absences were considered as unauthorized. Moreover, the number of unauthorized absences incurred by Garcia exceeded that allowed by law. Therefore, he is deemed to be a habitual absentee. Consequently, just like loafing, frequent unauthorized absences or habitual absenteeism is a grave offense where the penalty of suspension from work for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense and dismissal for the second, [66] are imposed.\n\nAs regards the charge of disgraceful and immoral conduct against Garcia and Guevarra, the OCA\u2019s findings and recommendation are correct.\u00a0 Garcia and Guevarra failed to refute the alleged illicit relationship and simply labeled the charge against them as malicious, fabricated and baseless. On the other hand, incontrovertible proof such as the marriage contract [67] of Guevarra with her husband, the birth certificate [68] of one of Guevarra\u2019s children with Garcia, and the affidavit of acknowledgement/admission of paternity [69] by Garcia were presented to support the allegation of immoral conduct. Moreover, the genuineness and authenticity of these documents were never questioned. Thus, there is no doubt that Garcia and Guevarra had, and appears to still have, an illicit relationship while the latter is still legally married. Such a relationship is highly frowned upon, especially when court employees are involved because they are expected to maintain moral righteousness and uprightness in their professional and private conduct to preserve the integrity and dignity of the courts of justice. [70] For the grave offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct, the rules impose a penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and dismissal for the second offense. [71]\n\nIn sum, as modified, Garcia committed not only simple misconduct and disgraceful and immoral conduct but also the offenses of habitual absenteeism and loafing and violation of office rules and regulations. Guevarra, on the other hand, committed the offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct. In imposing the proper penalties especially with regard to multiple offenses, Section 55, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service provides that:\n\nSection 55. Penalty for the Most Serious Offense. \u2013 If the respondent is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge or count and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances.\nInsofar as Garcia is concerned, disgraceful and immoral conduct, and habitual absenteeism and loafing are the most serious offenses and, thus, the corresponding penalty shall be imposed in its maximum, after considering the other offenses as aggravating circumstances pursuant to the above rule in relation to Section 54 which provides:\n\nSec. 54. Manner of Imposition . \u2013 When applicable, the imposition of the penalty may be made in accordance with the manner provided herein below:\nThe minimum of the penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present.\n\nThe medium of the penalty shall be imposed where no mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present.\n\nThe maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present.\n\nWhere aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present, paragraph [a] shall be applied where there are more mitigating circumstances present; paragraph [b] shall be applied when the circumstances equally offset each other; and paragraph [c] shall be applied when there are more aggravating circumstances.\nAccordingly, the OCA\u2019s recommendation of suspension from work for one (1) year without pay against Garcia and suspension for one (1) month without pay against Guevarra are proper, after considering the mitigating circumstances of the latter\u2019s twenty (20) long years of service and her first ever commission of the offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nWith regard to the complaint against Atty. Buencamino and Flores, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the OCA\u2019s findings and recommendation of dismissal of the complaint as it was clearly without merit.\n\nFinally, in her January 15, 2014 Letter, [72] Flores appealed for the release of her terminal leave benefits, as the same were withheld at the time of her retirement, and expressed her willingness to set aside Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) as payment for any fine that she might incur. Since the complaint against her was correctly dismissed, her terminal leave benefits can be released.\n\nWHEREFORE,\nThe complaint against respondents Atty. Monalisa A. Buencamino, Clerk of Court IV, and Jovita P. Flores, Records Officer II, both of the Office of the Clerk of Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City, in A.M. No. P-09-2691 [formerly A.M.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JERIC PAVIA Y PALIZA @ \u201cJERIC\u201d AND JUAN BUENDIA Y DELOS REYES @ \u201cJUNE\u201d, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.R E S O L U T I O N PEREZ, J.: For resolution of the Court is the appeal filed by Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia (appellants) from the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04020. The CA affirmed the Judgment[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna which found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs punishable under Section 13, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165. Appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.The AntecedentsOn 29 March 2005, at around 6:00 in the evening, a confidential informant reported to SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a (SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a) of the San Pedro Municipal Police Station, San Pedro, Laguna, that a pot session was taking place at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d located at Barangay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Upon receipt of the information, SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a formed a team to conduct police operations against the suspect. The team was composed of the confidential informant, PO2 Rommel Bautista (PO2 Bautista), PO3 Jay Parunggao (PO3 Parunggao), PO1 Jifford Signap and SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a as team leader.[3]At around 9:00 in the evening of the same date, the team proceeded to the target area. When the team arrived, the members saw that Obet\u2019s house was closed. Since the house was not surrounded by a fence, PO2 Bautista approached the house and peeped through a small opening in a window where he saw four persons in a circle having a pot session in the living room. PO3 Parunggao then tried to find a way to enter the house and found an unlocked door. He entered the house, followed by PO2 Bautista and they caught the four persons engaged in a pot session by surprise. After they introduced themselves as police officers, they arrested the four suspects and seized the drug paraphernalia found at the scene.[4] Among those arrested were herein appellants, from each of whom a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance were confiscated by PO3 Parunggao after he conducted a body search on their persons.[5] PO3 Parunggao marked the plastic sachet he seized from appellant Pavia with \u201cJP,\u201d representing the initials of Jeric Pavia while that taken from appellant Buendia was marked, also by PO3 Parunggao, with \u201cJB,\u201d representing the initials of Juan Buendia.[6] These plastic sachets were transmitted to the crime laboratory for qualitative examination where they tested positive for \u201cshabu.\u201d[7]Consequently, appellants were charged with violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in two separate but identically worded informations which read:That on or about 29 March 2005, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused without authority of the law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody [of] METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing zero point zero two (0.02) gram, in the company of two persons. [8]When arraigned, both appellants pleaded not guilty to the offense.[9]A joint trial of the cases ensued.In defense, appellants provided a different version of the incident. According to them, on the questioned date and time, they were roaming the streets of Baranggay Cuyab, selling star apples. A prospective buyer of the fruits called them over to his house and requested them to go inside, to which they acceded. When they were about to leave the house, several persons who introduced themselves as policemen arrived and invited appellants to go with them to the precinct. There, they were incarcerated and falsely charged with violation of the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002.[10]The Ruling of the RTCThe trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove the offense charged through the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of its witness. The trial court noted that the police officers carried out a lawful arrest before they proceeded with the bodily search of appellants. Moreover, there was no clear and convincing evidence that the team of PO3 Parunggao was inspired by any improper motive when they carried out their operation. Thus, the testimony of PO2 Bautista on the witness stand, narrating the events leading to the apprehension of appellants, deserves full faith and credit.[11]The Ruling of the Court of AppealsOn appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, upon a finding that the evidence on record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements necessary for the conviction of the offense charged.[12]On the contention of appellants that their warrantless arrest was illegal and, therefore, the items seized from them as a result of that arrest were inadmissible in evidence against them, the CA held that this argument totally lacks merit. According to the CA:We stress at the outset that the [appellants] failed to question the legality of their warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused [is] estopped from assailing the legality of [his] arrest if [he] failed to move for the quashing of the Information against [him] before [his] arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before [he] enter[s] [his] plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.In any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrests conducted on [appellants] were valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant x x x.x x x xParagraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an in flagrante delicto arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught in flagrante delicto to be valid, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.After a careful evaluation of the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto.We emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the house where the pot session was conducted and to their arrest were triggered by a \u201ctip\u201d from a concerned citizen that a \u201cpot session\u201d was in progress at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d at Baranggay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the \u201ctime element\u201d involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be an extended period of time and it was then 9:00 p.m.). In view of the urgency, SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place to verify the report. At the place, the responding police officers verified through a small opening in the window and saw the accused-appellants and their other two (2) companions sniffing \u201cshabu\u201d to use the words of PO2 Bautista. There was therefore sufficient probable cause for the police officers to believe that the accused-appellants were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the accused-appellants indeed possessed and were even using a prohibited drug, contrary to law. When an accused is caught in flagrante delicto, the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.In the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the [appellants] were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in their possession. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search x x x that yielded two (2) heat-sealed plastic sachets of \u201cshabu.\u201d x x xx x x xAll the x x x requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at a certain \u201cObet\u2019s\u201d place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the [appellants] as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the [appellants] incident to their arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be \u201cshabu\u201d. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered in the living room. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.x x x xAs correctly found by the trial court, the [appellants'] story is unworthy of belief. Their denial must fail in the light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witness. As stated earlier, PO2 Bautista testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. He did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.Courts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP crime Laboratory on the drugs recovered from the [appellants] which revealed that the confiscated plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of \"shabu\u201d: two (2) heated transparent plastic sachet with markings \u201cJB\u201d and \u201cJP\u201d containing 0.02 gram of white crystalline substance each both yielded positive results.[13]With respect to appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody because the police operatives failed to strictly comply with Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, the CA has this to say:The chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.Contrary to what the [appellants] want to portray, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drug was shown not to have been broken. After the seizure of the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the [appellants'] possession and of the various drug paraphernalia in the living room, the police immediately brought the [appellants] to the police station, together with the seized items. PO3 Parunggao himself brought these items to the police station and marked them. The plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance was marked \"JB\" and \"JP\". These confiscated items were immediately turned over by PO2 Bautista to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon, Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City for examination to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. After a qualitative examination conducted on the specimens, Forensic Chemist Lorna Ravelas Tria concluded that the plastic sachets recovered from the accused-appellants tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug, per Chemistry Report Nos. D-0381-05 and D-0382-05.When the prosecution presented these marked specimens in court, PO2 Baustista positively identified them to be the same items they seized from the [appellants] and which PO3 Parunggao later marked at the police station, from where the seized items were turned over to the laboratory for examination based on a duly prepared request.Thus, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were first discovered until they were brought for examination. Besides, as earlier stated, the [appellants] did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during the tria1. The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs seized from the accused-appellants were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.Jurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply, with Section 2l (1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised. We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense. All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court.[14] x x xOur RulingWe deny the appeal.Appellants are charged under Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which provides:Section 13. Possession of Dangerous Drugs During Parties, Social Gatherings or Meetings. \u2013 Any person found possessing any dangerous drug during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons, shall suffer the maximum penalties provided for in Section 11 of this Act, regardless of the quantity and purity of such dangerous drugs.The elements for the illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 are the same as those for the violation of Section 11 of the law: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused,[15] with the additional element that (4) the accused possessed the prohibited or dangerous drug during a social gathering or meeting, or in the company of at least two persons.As correctly found by the CA, the evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements. The testimony of PO2 Bautista on this point is determinative: q. When you said PO3 Parunggao saw that the door of the house was not locked, what did you do? a. He entered the house and we followed him, maam [sic]. x x x x q. In what part of the house where [sic] this [sic] people engaged in a pot session? a. At the sala, maam [sic]. q.

PO3 Parunggao introduced ourselves as police officers, maam [sic]. q. What happened after that? a. We confiscated the drug paraphernalias [sic] and then PO3 Parunggao conducted body search and was able to confiscate shabu from the two of the people there maam [sic]. q. Where were you when PO3 Parunggao conducted a search? a. I was behind him, maam [sic]. q. Did you see him conducting a search? a. Yes, maam [sic]. q. What did you see him doing? a. I saw that he was able to confiscate small plastic sachet containing shabu, maam [sic]. q. From whom? a. From Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia, maam [sic]. q.

You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same? a. From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. x x x x q. You said that PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet with white crystalline substance from two person [sic], one was identified as Jeric Pavia, who was the other one? a. It was Juan Buendia, maam [sic] q. Please identify him if he is in court? a. That man also in the first row, at the right portion, wearing yellow shirt (pointed to a person who, when asked answered by the name of Juan Buendia). q. Where were you when PO3 Parunggao confiscated from Juan Buendia the plastic sachet of shabu? a. I was behind him, maam [sic]. x x x x q. On [sic] what part of the body of Juan Buendia was the item taken by Officer Parunggao? a. Also in [sic] his pocket, maam [sic].[16] The same testimony of PO2 Bautista also established the chain of custody of the prohibited drugs taken from appellants. Thus: q. You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated [sic] plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same? a. From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. q. And do you know what PO3 Parunggao do with the item? a. He placed marking on it, maam [sic]. q. In what place did he put the marking? a. At the police station maam [sic]. q. What markings did he place? a. It was marked JP representing the initials of accused Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. q. Where were you when Officer Parunggao placed that marking on the item? a. I was beside him, maam [sic]. q. Can you describe the plastic sachet? a. It is a small transparent plastic sachet which contains white crystalline substance otherwise known as shabu, maam [sic]. q. Who was in possession of the plastic sachet from the time PO3 Parunggao took it from the possession of Jeric Pavia up to the police station? a. It was P03 Parunggao, maam [sic]. q. I am showing to you a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings JP, please identify the same? a. This is the same item confiscated from Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. x x x x q. Did you come to know what Officer Parunggao do with the plastic sachet confiscated from Juan Buendia? a. He brought it to the police station, maam [sic]. q. And what did he do with it? a. He placed the markings JB, maam [sic]. q. Who was in possession of the plastic sachet with markings JB from Aplaya [where the pot session took place] to the police station? a. It was PO3 Parunggao, maam. q. I am showing to you a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings JB, please identify the same? a. This is the same item confiscated from Juan Buendia by PO3 Parunggao, maam [sic].[17] It is likewise important to note that it was PO2 Bautista himself who brought the request[18] for laboratory examination of the substance taken from appellants from the San Pedro Police Station to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Calamba City, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the confiscated items are preserved. Thus, the fact that the apprehending team did not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render appellants\u2019 arrest illegal or the items seized from them inadmissible in evidence.As held by this Court in the case of People v. Llanita:[19]RA 9165 and its subsequent Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require strict compliance as to the chain of custody rule. x x x. We have emphasized that what is essential is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201dBriefly stated, non-compliance with the procedural requirements under RA 9165 and its IRR relative to the custody, photographing, and drug-testing of the apprehended persons, is not a serious flaw that can render void the seizures and custody of drugs in a buy-bust operation.x x x xx x x. We recognize that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 may not always be possible under field conditions; the police operates under varied conditions, and cannot at all times attend to all the niceties of the procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence.Finally, both the trial court and the CA rejected appellants\u2019 defense of denial and frame-up for failure to substantiate the same.Indeed, the defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act. In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence. In the case before us, appellants failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their claims. Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations.[20] Consequently, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive, this Court will not appreciate the defense of denial or frame-up and instead apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents.[21]In view of the foregoing, we see no reason to deviate from the well-discussed decision of the CA, its findings and conclusions having been supported by both law and applicable jurisprudence.WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R.

CR-H.C. No. 04020. The CA affirmed the Judgment [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna which found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs punishable under Section 13, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165. Appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nOn 29 March 2005, at around 6:00 in the evening, a confidential informant reported to SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a (SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a) of the San Pedro Municipal Police Station, San Pedro, Laguna, that a pot session was taking place at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d located at Barangay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Upon receipt of the information, SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a formed a team to conduct police operations against the suspect. The team was composed of the confidential informant, PO2 Rommel Bautista (PO2 Bautista), PO3 Jay Parunggao (PO3 Parunggao), PO1 Jifford Signap and SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a as team leader. [3]\n\nAt around 9:00 in the evening of the same date, the team proceeded to the target area. When the team arrived, the members saw that Obet\u2019s house was closed. Since the house was not surrounded by a fence, PO2 Bautista approached the house and peeped through a small opening in a window where he saw four persons in a circle having a pot session in the living room. PO3 Parunggao then tried to find a way to enter the house and found an unlocked door. He entered the house, followed by PO2 Bautista and they caught the four persons engaged in a pot session by surprise. After they introduced themselves as police officers, they arrested the four suspects and seized the drug paraphernalia found at the scene. [4] Among those arrested were herein appellants, from each of whom a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance were confiscated by PO3 Parunggao after he conducted a body search on their persons. [5] PO3 Parunggao marked the plastic sachet he seized from appellant Pavia with \u201cJP,\u201d representing the initials of Jeric Pavia while that taken from appellant Buendia was marked, also by PO3 Parunggao, with \u201cJB,\u201d representing the initials of Juan Buendia. [6] These plastic sachets were transmitted to the crime laboratory for qualitative examination where they tested positive for \u201cshabu .\u201d [7]\n\nConsequently, appellants were charged with violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in two separate but identically worded informations which read:\n\nThat on or about 29 March 2005, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused without authority of the law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody [of] METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing zero point zero two (0.02) gram, in the company of two persons. [8]\nWhen arraigned, both appellants pleaded not guilty to the offense. [9]\n\nA joint trial of the cases ensued.\n\nIn defense, appellants provided a different version of the incident. According to them, on the questioned date and time, they were roaming the streets of Baranggay Cuyab, selling star apples. A prospective buyer of the fruits called them over to his house and requested them to go inside, to which they acceded. When they were about to leave the house, several persons who introduced themselves as policemen arrived and invited appellants to go with them to the precinct. There, they were incarcerated and falsely charged with violation of the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002. [10]\n\nThe Ruling of the RTC\n\nThe trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove the offense charged through the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of its witness. The trial court noted that the police officers carried out a lawful arrest before they proceeded with the bodily search of appellants. Moreover, there was no clear and convincing evidence that the team of PO3 Parunggao was inspired by any improper motive when they carried out their operation. Thus, the testimony of PO2 Bautista on the witness stand, narrating the events leading to the apprehension of appellants, deserves full faith and credit. [11]\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nOn appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, upon a finding that the evidence on record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements necessary for the conviction of the offense charged. [12]\n\nOn the contention of appellants that their warrantless arrest was illegal and, therefore, the items seized from them as a result of that arrest were inadmissible in evidence against them, the CA held that this argument totally lacks merit. According to the CA:\n\nWe stress at the outset that the [appellants] failed to question the legality of their warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused [is] estopped from assailing the legality of [his] arrest if [he] failed to move for the quashing of the Information against [him] before [his] arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before [he] enter[s] [his] plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.\n\nIn any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrests conducted on [appellants] were valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant x x x.\n\nx x x x\n\nParagraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an in flagrante delicto arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught in flagrante delicto to be valid, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.\n\nAfter a careful evaluation of the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto.\n\nWe emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the house where the pot session was conducted and to their arrest were triggered by a \u201ctip\u201d from a concerned citizen that a \u201cpot session\u201d was in progress at the house of a certain \u201cObet \u201d at Baranggay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the \u201ctime element\u201d involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be an extended period of time and it was then 9:00 p.m.). In view of the urgency, SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place to verify the report. At the place, the responding police officers verified through a small opening in the window and saw the accused-appellants and their other two (2) companions sniffing \u201c shabu \u201d to use the words of PO2 Bautista. There was therefore sufficient probable cause for the police officers to believe that the accused-appellants were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the accused-appellants indeed possessed and were even using a prohibited drug, contrary to law. When an accused is caught in flagrante delicto , the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.\n\nIn the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the [appellants] were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in their possession. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search x x x that yielded two (2) heat-sealed plastic sachets of \u201c shabu .\u201d x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nAll the x x x requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at a certain \u201cObet\u2019s\u201d place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the [appellants] as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the [appellants] incident to their arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be \u201cshabu\u201d. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered in the living room. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.\n\nx x x x\n\nAs correctly found by the trial court, the [appellants'] story is unworthy of belief. Their denial must fail in the light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witness. As stated earlier, PO2 Bautista testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. He did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.\n\nCourts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP crime Laboratory on the drugs recovered from the [appellants] which revealed that the confiscated plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of \"shabu\u201d: two (2) heated transparent plastic sachet with markings \u201cJB\u201d and \u201cJP\u201d containing 0.02 gram of white crystalline substance each both yielded positive results. [13]\nWith respect to appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody because the police operatives failed to strictly comply with Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, the CA has this to say:\n\nThe chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.\n\nContrary to what the [appellants] want to portray, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drug was shown not to have been broken. After the seizure of the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the [appellants'] possession and of the various drug paraphernalia in the living room, the police immediately brought the [appellants] to the police station, together with the seized items. PO3 Parunggao himself brought these items to the police station and marked them. The plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance was marked \"JB\" and \"JP\". These confiscated items were immediately turned over by PO2 Bautista to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon, Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City for examination to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. After a qualitative examination conducted on the specimens, Forensic Chemist Lorna Ravelas Tria concluded that the plastic sachets recovered from the accused-appellants tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug, per Chemistry Report Nos. D-0381-05 and D-0382-05.\n\nWhen the prosecution presented these marked specimens in court, PO2 Baustista positively identified them to be the same items they seized from the [appellants] and which PO3 Parunggao later marked at the police station, from where the seized items were turned over to the laboratory for examination based on a duly prepared request.\n\nThus, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were first discovered until they were brought for examination. Besides, as earlier stated, the [appellants] did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during the tria1. The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs seized from the accused-appellants were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.\n\nJurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply, with Section 2l (1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised. We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense. All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court. [14] x x x\n\nOur Ruling\n\nWe deny the appeal.\n\nAppellants are charged under Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which provides:\n\nSection 13. Possession of Dangerous Drugs During Parties, Social Gatherings or Meetings . \u2013 Any person found possessing any dangerous drug during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons, shall suffer the maximum penalties provided for in Section 11 of this Act, regardless of the quantity and purity of such dangerous drugs.\nThe elements for the illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 are the same as those for the violation of Section 11 of the law: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused, [15] with the additional element that (4) the accused possessed the prohibited or dangerous drug during a social gathering or meeting, or in the company of at least two persons.\n\nAs correctly found by the CA, the evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements. The testimony of PO2 Bautista on this point is determinative:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nq. | When you said PO3 Parunggao saw that the door of the house was not locked, what did you do?\na. | He entered the house and we followed him, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | In what part of the house where [sic] this [sic] people engaged in a pot session?\na. | At the sala, maam [sic].\nq. | And what was their reaction when PO3 Parunggao and the rest of the team barged in?\na. | They were surprised, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | And what did you do after that?\na. | PO3 Parunggao introduced ourselves as police officers, maam [sic].\nq. | What happened after that?\na. | We confiscated the drug paraphernalias [sic] and then PO3 Parunggao conducted body search and was able to confiscate shabu from the two of the people there maam [sic].\nq. | Where were you when PO3 Parunggao conducted a search?\na. | I was behind him, maam [sic].\nq. | Did you see him conducting a search?\na. | Yes, maam [sic].\nq. | What did you see him doing?\na. | I saw that he was able to confiscate small plastic sachet containing shabu, maam [sic].\nq. | From whom?\na. | From Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia, maam [sic].\nq. | If this Jeric Pavia is in court right now, will you be able to point to him?\na. | Yes, maam [sic].\nq. | Please point to him?\na. | That man in the first row wearing yellow shirt, maam [sic] (pointed to a person inside the courtroom who, when asked answered by the name of Jeric Pavia).\nq. | You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same?\na. | From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | You said that PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet with white crystalline substance from two person [sic], one was identified as Jeric Pavia, who was the other one?\na. | It was Juan Buendia, maam [sic]\nq. | Please identify him if he is in court?\na. | That man also in the first row, at the right portion, wearing yellow shirt (pointed to a person who, when asked answered by the name of Juan Buendia).\nq. | Where were you when PO3 Parunggao confiscated from Juan Buendia the plastic sachet of shabu?\na. | I was behind him, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | On [sic] what part of the body of Juan Buendia was the item taken by Officer Parunggao?\na. | Also in [sic] his pocket, maam [sic].[16]\n[END_TABLE]\n\nq.

This is the same item confiscated from Juan Buendia by PO3 Parunggao, maam [sic]. [17]\nIt is likewise important to note that it was PO2 Bautista himself who brought the request [18] for laboratory examination of the substance taken from appellants from the San Pedro Police Station to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Calamba City, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the confiscated items are preserved. Thus, the fact that the apprehending team did not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render appellants\u2019 arrest illegal or the items seized from them inadmissible in evidence.\n\nAs held by this Court in the case of People v. Llanita: [19]\n\nRA 9165 and its subsequent Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require strict compliance as to the chain of custody rule. x x x. We have emphasized that what is essential is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d\n\nBriefly stated, non-compliance with the procedural requirements under RA 9165 and its IRR relative to the custody, photographing, and drug-testing of the apprehended persons, is not a serious flaw that can render void the seizures and custody of drugs in a buy-bust operation.\n\nx x x x\n\nx x x. We recognize that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 may not always be possible under field conditions; the police operates under varied conditions, and cannot at all times attend to all the niceties of the procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence.\nFinally, both the trial court and the CA rejected appellants\u2019 defense of denial and frame-up for failure to substantiate the same.\n\nIndeed, the defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.\u00a0 In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence.\u00a0 In the case before us, appellants failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their claims. Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations. [20] Consequently, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive, this Court will not appreciate the defense of denial or frame-up and instead apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents.

PRESIDING JUDGE OF RTC, QUEZON CITY, BR. 105 AND MANILA BANKING CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.[G.R. No. 128422] DOLORES V. MOLINA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND EPIMACO ORETA, RESPONDENTS. [G.R. No. 128911] THE MANILA BANKING CORPORATION AND ALBERTO V. REYES, PETITIONERS, VS. DOLORES V. MOLINA AND HON. MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.DECISION LEONEN, J.: These consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994.[1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration.[2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.[4]In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00.[5]On August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco).[6]In order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.I G.R. No. 109645[7]On November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088.[8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\"[9]Several days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case.[10]On April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\"[11] The Motion was granted on the same date.[12]The Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified.[13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties.[14]On July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\"[15]However, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing.[16]At this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition.[17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18](2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19](3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:[T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition.[21]During the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988.[22]On September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name.[23]Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[24]Meanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\"[25]Judge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287.[27]The Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:the Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him[28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late.[29]The Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\"[30]Molina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc.[31]Ortigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order.[32] Ortigas prayed that this court:(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\"[33]IIG.R. No. 112564[34]G.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\"[35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920.[36]TMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\"[37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\"[38]Molina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\"[39]Molina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\"[40]The trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss.[41]Molina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993.[42]Molina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC.[43]Molina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993.[44]IIIRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564In the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:WHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[45]This court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties.[46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13.[47]In addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees.[48]As to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.(2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53](3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54](4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:(a)Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55](b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56](c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57](d) Navarro v. Ortigas[58](e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General[61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[62]The filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.[63]Ortigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\"[64] was not granted.On the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994.[65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645.[66]Also, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\"[67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them.[68]Despite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[69]The second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:TO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.IT IS SO ORDERED.[70]In the Resolution dated July 24, 1995,[71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and(3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]Despite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);(b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and(c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]TMBC filed a Motion for Contempt[74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996,[75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:It is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[76] (Emphasis in the original)With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary.[77]TMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108.[78]In the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:WHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.SO ORDERED.[79] (Emphasis in the original)IVFacts of G.R. No. 128422Respondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint,[80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\"[81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\"[82]Oreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands.[83]The registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas.[84]The one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\"[85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.TMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership.[86]In 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\"[87]Molina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\"[88]Molina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael.[89]However, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\"[90]Several of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina.[91]Oreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos,[92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:Psd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated.[93](2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau,[94] stating that:The procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents.[95](3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:from which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings.[96](4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967.[97]Oreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287[98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167,[99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him.[100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\"[101]Molina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939.[102]In September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\"[103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau.[104]Molina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint.[105]In the Resolution dated July 21, 1994,[106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case.[107]Oreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994.[108]Oreta filed a Petition for Review[109] before the Department of Justice.Oreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court.[110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina.[111]With regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088.[112]Molina filed a Comment,[113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088[114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis.[115]Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996.[116]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents.[117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996.[118]Undaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[119] before the Court of Appeals.In her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:Whether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding?[120]Molina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her.[121]The Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:It appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.SO ORDERED.[122]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition.[123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\"[124]The Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997.[125]The Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed.[126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\"[127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals,[128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case.[129]From the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[130] before this court.V Facts of G.R. No. 128911On January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564.[131]The action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856.[132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title.[133]TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court.[134]Molina opposed the Motion to Dismiss.[135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997.[136]TMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes)[137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:Before this Court are the following:Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997TMBC Motion to DismissBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to DismissTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.Considering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.Accordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.Let summons be served on the newly named defendant.There is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.SO ORDERED.[138]TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.[139]TMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order.[140]TMBC and Reyes argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint.[141]TMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina.[142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping.[143]VI Procedural developmentIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment.[144]Oreta filed a Motion to Consolidate[145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997.[146]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate[147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.[148]Molina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate.[149]In the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate.[150]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases.[151]In the Resolution dated June 23, 1997,[152] this court noted the following:(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;(b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;(c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and(d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997.[154]On August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction].[155]TMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920.[157]TMBC and Reyes also argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice.[158]In the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\"[159]In the Resolution dated September 3, 1997,[160] this court noted the following:(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina.(b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder[161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997)[162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder.[163]In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.][165]In the same Resolution,[166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.[167]TMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997].[168]TMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket[169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\"[170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic.[171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997.[172]From the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance[173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911.[174]VIIIssuesIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and](2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal.[175]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176] over TMBC's properties; and(2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.VIIIArguments of the partiesG.R. No. 128422Molina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition,[178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office.[179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\"[180]Molina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[181]Molina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\"[182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process.[183]On the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment.[184]Molina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088.[185]Oreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\"[186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:[187]Section 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)Molina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside.[188]Since an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\"[189]Oreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed.[190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment.[191]In her Reply,[192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\"[193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088.[194]Molina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[195]Oreta filed a Rejoinder[196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review.[197]G.R. No. 128911TMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.][198]Ownership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina,[199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation,[200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta,[201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol.[202]Despite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title[203] and an Amended Complaint.[204]TMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:That I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof.[205]Molina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void.[206]In her Comment,[207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court.[208]She filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party.[209]The Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes.[210]The trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes.[211]TMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997.[212]Molina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was.[213]Molina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss.[214]This court now rules as follows:G.R. No. 128422The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997[215] and March 11, 1997[216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.Section 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:Section 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.b. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.d. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96[217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.In Donato v. Court of Appeals,[218] this court held that:[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration.[219]The ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David[220] and Valdecantos v. People[221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.In this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:In the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration.[222] (Emphasis supplied)Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.However, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.Prior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her.[223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996.[224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997.[225]In other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.In Crespo v. Judge Mogul:[226][t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.In order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court.[227]The ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al.[228]In subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts.[229]Chan v. Formaran III, et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.[230] It was further discussed that:[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion.[231]Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.In any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).Chief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\"[232] He discussed the following:Contrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.We have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title.[233]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:After an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor.[234]Chief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.This court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata:[235][T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well.[236]G.R. No. 128911In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:In its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"The case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.Now, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.SO ORDERED.[238]TMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997.[239]Molina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation[240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case:[241]3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC.[242]Molina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases.[243]In addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier.[244]Judge Bacalla also filed his explanation.[245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina, he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997.[246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997.[247]Molina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated.[248]This court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.In the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:WHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.In G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[249]That Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.Forum shopping is defined as:[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court.[250]Forum shopping consists of the following elements:(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.[251]All the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.For the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:ascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.[252]In this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership.[253]Molina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.Further, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.The elements of res judicata are:(a) the former judgment must be final;(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and(d) there must be between the first and the second actions (i) identity of parties, (ii) identity of subject matter, and (iii) identity of cause of action.[254]These requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.This court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00.[256]This court held that:[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \"no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.Apart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.Evidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.Evidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[257] (Emphasis in the original)Regarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997.[258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:(1)DECLARE Dolores V. Molina GUILTY of contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;(2) The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is made PERMANENT; and(3) Treble costs[259] are imposed against Dolores V. Molina.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr.,* Del Castillo (Acting Chairperson), Villarama, Jr.,** and Mendoza, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting Member per S.O.

MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nLEONEN, J.:\n\nThese consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.\n\nG.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994. [1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration. [2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration. [4]\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00. [5]\n\nOn August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco). [6]\n\nIn order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.\n\nI\nG.R. No. 109645 [7]\n\nOn November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088. [8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\" [9]\n\nSeveral days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case. [10]\n\nOn April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\" [11] The Motion was granted on the same date. [12]\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified. [13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties. [14]\n\nOn July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:\n(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\" [15]\nHowever, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing. [16]\n\nAt this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition. [17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18]\n | \n(2) | Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19]\n | \n(3) | The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:\n | \n | [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\" [18] (2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina. [19] (3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that: [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc. [20] Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition. [21]\n\nDuring the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:\n[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988. [22]\nOn September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name. [23]\n\nOrtigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [24]\n\nMeanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\" [25]\n\nJudge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287. [27]\n\nThe Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:\nthe Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him [28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late. [29]\nThe Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\" [30]\n\nMolina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc. [31]\n\nOrtigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. [32] Ortigas prayed that this court:\n(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and\n\n(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\" [33]\nII\nG.R. No. 112564 [34]\n\nG.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\" [35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920. [36]\n\nTMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\" [37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\" [38]\n\nMolina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\" [39]\n\nMolina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\" [40]\n\nThe trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss. [41]\n\nMolina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993. [42]\n\nMolina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC. [43]\n\nMolina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993. [44]\n\nIII\nRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564\n\nIn the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [45]\nThis court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties. [46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13. [47]\n\nIn addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:\n[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees. [48]\nAs to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49]of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.\n | | \n(2) | As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50]She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51]Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52]She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53]\n | | \n(3) | The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54]\n | | \n(4) | Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:\n | | \n | (a) | Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55]\n | (b) | Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56]\n | (c) | Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57]\n | (d) | Navarro v. Ortigas[58]\n | (e) | Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59]The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\" [49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs. (2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\" [50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her. [51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088. [52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\" [53] (3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\" [54] (4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely: (a) Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo [55] (b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz [56] (c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas [57] (d) Navarro v. Ortigas [58] (e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085. [59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\" [60] This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General [61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [62]\n\nThe filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt. [63]\n\nOrtigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\" [64] was not granted.\n\nOn the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994. [65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645. [66]\n\nAlso, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\" [67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them. [68]\n\nDespite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [69]\n\nThe second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:\nTO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [70]\nIn the Resolution dated July 24, 1995, [71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(2) | To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and\n | \n(3) | To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and (3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition. [72]\nDespite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);\n | \n(b) | [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and\n | \n(c) | [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995); (b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and (c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\" [73]\nTMBC filed a Motion for Contempt [74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, [75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:\nIt is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [76] (Emphasis in the original) With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary. [77]\n\nTMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108. [78]\n\nIn the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:\nWHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [79] (Emphasis in the original)\nIV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128422\n\nRespondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint, [80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\" [81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\" [82]\n\nOreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands. [83]\n\nThe registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas. [84]\n\nThe one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\" [85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.\n\nTMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership. [86]\n\nIn 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\" [87]\n\nMolina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\" [88]\n\nMolina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael. [89]\n\nHowever, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\" [90]\n\nSeveral of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina. [91]\n\nOreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:\n\n(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos, [92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:\nPsd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated. [93]\n(2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau, [94] stating that:\nThe procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents. [95]\n(3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:\nfrom which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings. [96]\n(4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967. [97]\n\nOreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287 [98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167, [99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him. [100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\" [101]\n\nMolina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939. [102]\n\nIn September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\" [103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau. [104]\n\nMolina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint. [105]\n\nIn the Resolution dated July 21, 1994, [106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case. [107]\n\nOreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994. [108]\n\nOreta filed a Petition for Review [109] before the Department of Justice.\n\nOreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court. [110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina. [111]\n\nWith regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088. [112]\n\nMolina filed a Comment, [113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088 [114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis. [115]\n\nChief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996. [116]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents. [117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996. [118]\n\nUndaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [119] before the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:\nWhether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding? [120]\nMolina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her. [121]\n\nThe Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:\nIt appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.\n\nSO ORDERED. [122]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition. [123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\" [124]\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997. [125]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed. [126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\" [127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals , [128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case. [129]\n\nFrom the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [130] before this court.\n\nV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128911\n\nOn January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564. [131]\n\nThe action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856. [132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title. [133]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court. [134]\n\nMolina opposed the Motion to Dismiss. [135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997. [136]\n\nTMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes) [137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:\nBefore this Court are the following:\nSupplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997\n\nTMBC Motion to Dismiss\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to Dismiss\n\nTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.\nConsidering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.\n\nAccordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.\n\nLet summons be served on the newly named defendant.\n\nThere is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.\n\nSO ORDERED. [138]\nTMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. [139]\n\nTMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order. [140]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint. [141]\nTMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina. [142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping. [143]\n\nVI\nProcedural development\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment. [144]\n\nOreta filed a Motion to Consolidate [145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997. [146]\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate [147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. [148]\n\nMolina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate. [149]\n\nIn the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate. [150]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases. [151]\n\nIn the Resolution dated June 23, 1997, [152] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;\n(b) | Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;\n(c) | Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and\n(d) | Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction; (b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina; (c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and (d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911. [153] TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997. [154]\n\nOn August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction]. [155]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. [157]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice. [158]\nIn the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\" [159]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 3, 1997, [160] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | In G.R. No. 128911:\n | (i) | TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and\n | (ii) | Comment filed by Dolores Molina.\n(b) | In G.R. No. 128422:\n | (i) | Comment filed by Oreta;\n | (ii) | Reply filed by Molina; and\n | (iii) | Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina. (b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply. Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder [161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997) [162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder. [163]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.] [165]\nIn the same Resolution, [166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment. [167]\nTMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997]. [168]\n\nTMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket [169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\" [170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic. [171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:\n6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;\n\n6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997. [172]\nFrom the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance [173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911. [174]\n\nVII\nIssues\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:\n(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and]\n\n(2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal. [175]\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176]over TMBC's properties; and\n | \n(2) | Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177]and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\" [176] over TMBC's properties; and (2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, [177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\nVIII\nArguments of the parties\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nMolina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition, [178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office. [179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\" [180]\n\nMolina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [181]\n\nMolina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\" [182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process. [183]\n\nOn the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment. [184]\n\nMolina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088. [185]\n\nOreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\" [186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure: [187]\nSection 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:\n\n(a)\u00a0 In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;\n\n(b)\u00a0 In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and\n\n(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)\nMolina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside. [188]\n\nSince an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\" [189]\n\nOreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed. [190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment. [191]\n\nIn her Reply, [192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\" [193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088. [194]\n\nMolina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [195]\n\nOreta filed a Rejoinder [196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review. [197]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nTMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:\n2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.] [198]\nOwnership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina , [199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation , [200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta , [201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol . [202]\n\nDespite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title [203] and an Amended Complaint. [204]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:\nThat I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof. [205]\nMolina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void. [206]\n\nIn her Comment, [207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court. [208]\n\nShe filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party. [209]\n\nThe Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes. [210]\n\nThe trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes. [211]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997. [212]\n\nMolina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was. [213]\n\nMolina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. [214]\n\nThis court now rules as follows:\n\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nThe Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997 [215] and March 11, 1997 [216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.\n\nSection 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:\nSection 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.\n\nb. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.\n\nd. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.\n\n(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.\nSupreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96 [217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:\n1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.\n\n3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.\n\n4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.\n\n5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.\nIn Donato v. Court of Appeals , [218] this court held that:\n[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration. [219]\nThe ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David [220] and Valdecantos v. People [221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.\n\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:\nIn the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration. [222] (Emphasis supplied)\nThus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.\n\nHowever, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.\n\nPrior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her. [223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996. [224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997. [225]\n\nIn other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.\n\nIn Crespo v. Judge Mogul : [226]\n[t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.\n\nIn order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court. [227]\nThe ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al . [228]\nIn subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. [229]\nChan v. Formaran III , et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65. [230] It was further discussed that:\n[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion. [231]\nThus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.\n\nIn any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).\n\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\" [232] He discussed the following:\nContrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.\n\nWe have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title. [233]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:\nAfter an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor. [234]\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThis court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata : [235]\n\n[T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well. [236]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:\nIn its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\n\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.\n\n(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"\nThe case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.\n\nNow, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.\n\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;\n\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [238]\nTMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997. [239]\n\nMolina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation [240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case: [241]\n3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC. [242]\nMolina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases. [243]\n\nIn addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier. [244]\n\nJudge Bacalla also filed his explanation. [245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina , he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997. [246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997. [247]\n\nMolina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated. [248]\n\nThis court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [249]\nThat Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.\n\nForum shopping is defined as:\n[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court. [250]\nForum shopping consists of the following elements:\n(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;\n\n(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and\n\n(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration. [251]\nAll the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.\n\nFor the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:\nascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. [252]\nIn this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership. [253]\n\nMolina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nFurther, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.\n\nThe elements of res judicata are:\n(a) the former judgment must be final;\n\n(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;\n\n(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and\n\n(d) there must be between the first and the second actions\n\n(i) identity of parties,\n\n(ii) identity of subject matter, and\n\n(iii) identity of cause of action. [254]\nThese requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nThis court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00. [256]\n\nThis court held that:\n[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \" no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.\n\nApart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.\n\nEvidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.\n\nEvidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [257] (Emphasis in the original)\nRegarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997. [258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | DECLAREDolores V. MolinaGUILTYof contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;\n | \n(2) | The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is madePERMANENT; and\n | \n(3) | Treble costs[259]are imposed against Dolores V.
