No. L-2702            February 28, 1906\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\nplaintiff-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nISIDORO OLIVAN, ET AL.,\n\ndefendants-appellants.\n\nFederico Olbes for appellants.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.\n\nCARSON,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe appellant in this case was found guilty of the offense of entering a house against the wishes of its owner (\n\nallanamiento de morada\n\n), and sentenced to two months and one day of\n\narresto mayor\n\n, and to pay a fine of 325 pesetas, and one-half of the costs of the trial, and further, to subsidiary imprisonment as prescribed by law, in case of insolvency.\n\nThe evidence introduced at the trial establishes the guilt of the accused of the crime with which he is charge, but we are of opinion that in imposing the penalty the court should have taken into consideration, as an extenuating circumstance, the fact that in the commission of the offense the accused acted under an impulse of sudden passion, the result of a wordy quarrel which had arisen between himself and the owner of the house, (Case 7, article 9, Penal Code.)\n\nWe therefore modify the sentence as imposed by the trial court, by substituting the penalty of one month and one day of\n\narresto mayor\n\nin its minimum degree for so much thereof as imposes two months and one day of\n\narresto mayor\n\nin its medium degree, and thus modified the sentence appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, and Willard, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
