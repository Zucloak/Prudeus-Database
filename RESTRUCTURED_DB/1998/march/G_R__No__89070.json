  "title": "two of the losing members of the Board of Directors of BENECO in the aforementioned case. Respondent claims in his comment (x x x) that Branch 7, motu proprio, dismissed Civil Case No. 2738-R for lack of jurisdiction on March 18,1993, which dismissal was [sic] became final due to respondentâs failure to perfect an appeal therefrom which claim according to the complainant, constitute[s] deliberate misrepresentation, if not falsehood, because the respondent indeed interposed an appeal such that on May 11, 1993, the RTC 7 of Baguio City transmitted the entire record of Civil Case No. 2738-R to the Court of Appeals per certified machine copy of the letter transmittal of same date (x x x). While respondent ânever essentially intended to assail the issuance by the NLRC of the Writ of Execution x x x nor sought to undo itâ (x x x) the complaint in Civil Case No. 2738-R which he filed prays for the immediate issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary writ of injunction for defendants Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio City Sheriff to cease and desist from enforcing the execution and levy of the writ of execution issued by the NLRC-CAR, pending resolution of the main action in said court (x x x) which complainant likewise claims as an unprocedural maneuver to frustrate the execution of the decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 89070 in complete disregard of settled jurisprudence that regular courts have no jurisdiction to hear and decide questions which arise and are incidental to the enforcement of decisions, orders and awards rendered in labor cases citing the case of Cangco vs. CA, 199 SCRA 677, a display of gross ignorance of the law. On May 26, 1993, respondent again filed for Abundio Awal and Nicasio Aliping with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 9, La Trinidad, Benguet, separate complaints for Judicial Declaration of Family Home Constituted, Ope Lege, and thus Exempt from Levy and Execution the subject properties with Damages, etc. docketed as Civil Cases Nos. 93-F-0414 (x x x) and 93-F-0415 (x x x), which are essentially similar actions to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment rendered in NLRC Case No. RAB-1-0313-84. He also filed an urgent Motion Ex-parte (x x x) praying for temporary restraining order in these two (2) cases. The complainant further alleges that respondentâs claim for damages against the defendant Sheriff is another improper and unprocedural maneuver which is likewise a violation of respondentâs oath not to sue on groundless suit since the said Sheriff was merely enforcing a writ of execution as part of his job.â Recommendation of the IBP As noted earlier, Investigating Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose recommended, and the IBP Board of Governors concurred, that respondent be suspended from the bar for six months for: 1. Falsehood, for stating in his comment before this Court that the order of the RTC dismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. 2738-R was not appealed on time 2. Failure to comply with Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 on forum shopping Commissioner Jose ratiocinated: âA cursory glance of (sic) x x x the complaint filed by the respondent in Civil Case No. 2738-R before the RTC of Baguio City, which complaint was signed and verified under oath by the respondent, reveals that it lacks the certification required by Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 which took effect on January 1, 1992 to the effect that âto the best of his knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals or different divisions thereof or any tribunal or agency. If there is any other action pending, he must state the status of the same. If he should learn that a similar action or proceeding has been filed or pending before the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals or different divisions thereof or any tribunal or agency[,] he should notify the court, tribunal or agency within five (5) days from such notice.â âAmong the other penalties, the said circular further provides that the lawyer may also be subjected to disciplinary proceedings for non-compliance thereof. âIn sum, it is clear that the respondent violated the provisions of Canon[s] 10 and 12 of the Code of Professional Responsibility under which the lawyer owes candor, fairness and good faith to the court and exert[s] every effort and consider[s] it his duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.â[4] This Courtâs Ruling We adopt and affirm the recommendation of the IBP suspending the respondent from the bar, but we increase the period from six (6) months to one (1) year and six (6) months. Forum Shopping Circular No. 28-91,[5] dated September 4, 1991 which took effect on January 1, 1992, requires a certificate of non-forum shopping to be attached to petitions filed before this Court and the Court of Appeals. This circular was revised on February 8, 1994. The IBP found that the respondent had violated it, because the complaint he filed before the RTC of Baguio City âlack[ed] the certification required by Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91.â[6] We distinguish. Respondentâs failure to attach the said certificate cannot be deemed a violation of the aforementioned circular, because the said requirement applied only to petitions filed with this Court and the Court of Appeals.[7] Likewise inapplicable is Administrative Circular No. 04-94 dated February 8, 1994 which extended the requirement of a certificate of non-forum shopping to all initiatory pleadings filed in all courts and quasi-judicial agencies other than this Court and the Court of Appeals. Circular No. 04-94 became effective only on April 1, 1994, but the assailed complaint for injunction was filed on March 18, 1993, and the petition for the constitution of a family home was instituted on May 26, 1993. Be that as it may, respondent is still guilty of forum shopping. In Chemphil Export and Import Corporation vs. Court of Appeals,[8] this Court declared that â(t)he rule against forum shopping has long been established and subsequent circulars[9] of this Court merely formalized the prohibition and provided the appropriate penalties against transgressors.â The prohibition is found in Section 1(e) of Rule 16 and Section 4 of Rule 2 of the 1964 Rules of Court, which provide: âSECTION 1. Grounds. -- Within the time for pleading, a motion to dismiss the action may be made on any of the following grounds: xxx xxx xxx (e) That there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause; xxx xxx xxx[10] âSEC. 4. Effect of splitting a single cause of action. -- If two or more complaints are brought for different parts of a single cause of action, the filing of the first may be pleaded in abatement of the other or others, in accordance with section 1 (e) of Rule 16, and a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a bar in the others.â[11] The prohibition is also contained in Circular No. 28-91. This circular did not only require that a certification of non-forum shopping be attached to the petitions filed before this Court or the Court of Appeals; it also decreed that forum shopping constituted direct contempt of court and could subject the offending lawyer to disciplinary action. The third paragraph thereof reads: â3. Penalties. (a) Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the summary dismissal of the multiple petition or complaint. (b) Any willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his lawyer wit the filing of multiple petitions and complaints to ensure favorable action shall constitute direct contempt of court. (c) The submission of false certification under Par. 2 of the Circular shall likewise constitute contempt of Court, without prejudice to the filing of criminal action against the guilty party. The lawyer may also be subjected to disciplinary proceedings.â (Underscoring supplied.) The foregoing were substantially reproduced in Revised Circular No. 28-91[12] and Administrative Circular No. 04-94.[13] In a long line of cases, this Court has held that forum shopping exists when, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than by appeal or certiorari) in another,[14] or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.[15] The most important factor in determining the existence of forum shopping is the âvexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same or related causes or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs.â[16] After this Court rendered its Decision[17] in Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.[18] and upon motion of BENECO, Labor Arbiter Irenarco R. Rimando issued a writ of execution[19] ordering the clerk of court and ex officio city sheriff of the Municipal Trial Court of Baguio City to levy on and sell at public auction personal and real property of the members of the Board of Directors of BENECO. On March 18, 1993, Respondent Flores, acting as counsel for BENECO Board Members Victor Laoyan, Nicasio Aliping, Lorenzo Pilando and Abundio Awal, filed with the RTC an injunction suit praying for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) âto preserve the status quo as now obtaining between the parties,â as well as a writ of preliminary preventive injunction ordering the clerk of court and the ex officio city sheriff of the MTC of Baguio to âcease and desist from enforcing by execution and levy the writ of execution from the NLRC-CAR, pending resolution of the main action raised in court.â[20] When this injunction case was dismissed, Respondent Flores filed with another branch of the RTC two identical but separate actions both entitled âJudicial Declaration of Family Home Constituted, ope lege, Exempt from Levy and Execution; with Damages, etc.,â docketed as Civil Case Nos. 93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415.[21] The said complaints were supplemented by an âUrgent Motion Ex Parteâ[22] which prayed for an order to temporarily restrain Sheriff Wilfredo V. Mendez from proceeding with the auction sale of plaintiffsâ property âto avoid rendering ineffectual and functus [oficio] any judgment of the court later in this [sic] cases, until further determined by the court.â Civil Case Nos. 93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415 are groundless suits. Modequillo vs. Breva,[23] reiterated in Manacop vs. Court of Appeals,[24] shows the frivolity of these proceedings: âUnder the Family Code, a family home is deemed constituted on a house and lot from the time it is occupied as a family residence. There is no need to constitute the same judicially or extrajudicially as required in the Civil Code. If the family actually resides in the premises, it is, therefore, a family home as contemplated by law. Thus, the creditors should take the necessary precautions to protect their interest before extending credit to the spouses or head of the family who owns the home. xxx. The exemption provided as aforestated is effective from the time of the constitution of the family home as such, and lasts so long as any of its beneficiaries actually resides therein.â Adhering to the Courtâs declaration in said cases, the subject properties are deemed constituted as family homes by operation of law under Article 153 of the Family Code. The suits for the constitution of a family home were not only frivolous and unnecessary; they were clearly asking for reliefs identical to the prayer previously dismissed by another branch of the RTC, i.e., to forestall the execution of a final judgment of the labor arbiter. That they were filed ostensibly for the judicial declaration of a family home was a mere smoke screen; in essence, their real objective was to restrain or delay the enforcement of the writ of execution. In his deliberate attempt to obtain the same relief in two different courts, Respondent Flores was obviously shopping for a âfriendlyâ forum which would capitulate to his improvident plea for an injunction and was thereby trifling with the judicial process.[25] We remind the respondent that, under the Code of Professional Responsibility,[26] he had a duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.[27] The Code also enjoins him from unduly delaying a case by impeding the execution of a judgment or by misusing court processes.[28] In consonance with Millare vs. Montero[29] and Garcia vs. Francisco,[30] respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for one year. In Millare, the respondent filed with different courts a total of six appeals, complaints and petitions which frustrated and delayed the execution of a final judgment. Holding that ârespondent âmade a mockery of the judicial processesâ and disregarded canons of professional ethics in intentionally frustrating the rights of a litigant in whose favor a judgment in the case was rendered [and], thus, âabused procedural rules to defeat the ends of substantial justice,ââ[31] this Court suspended the respondent from the practice of law for one year. In Garcia, the respondent was also suspended for one year from the practice of law, for violating the proscription against forum shopping. This Court held that âhe deserve[d] to be sanctioned, not only as a punishment for his misconduct but also as a warning to other lawyers who may be influenced by his example.â[32] Falsehood The investigating commissioner also held respondent liable for committing a falsehood because, in this administrative case, he stated in his comment that he had not âperfected an appeal on the dismissalâ of his petition for injunction. In his said comment, the respondent stated: âBranch 7 (of the RTC) motu proprio, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on March 18, 1993. Not having perfected an appeal on the dismissal, the order of dismissal became final under the Rules 15 days after its receipt by respondent on record, or before April 6, 1993. So that today this case is no longer pending. xxx. It should be noted that when Civil Case Nos. 93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415 for family homes and damages were filed in the court below on May 26, 1993, Civil Case NO. 2378-R which seems to give basis to the present Complaint was deemed terminated, there being no appeal formally taken and perfected in accordance with the Rules. xxx. And that precisely was the primal reason why respondent decided not to appeal any further anymore [sic] the order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the court below in Civil Case No. 2738, and let it be deemed final by the Rules and jurisprudence.â[33] (Underscoring supplied.) The indelible fact, however, is that respondent did file an appeal which was perfected later on. The original records of the injunction suit had been transmitted to the appellate court.[34] Moreover, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution dismissing the appeal.[35] Thus, in denying that he had appealed the decision of the RTC, respondent was making a false statement. Respondent argues that the withdrawal of his appeal means that no appeal was made under Section 2 of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court. The pertinent provisions of Rule 50[36]read: âSEC. 2. Effect of dismissal.-- Fifteen (15) days after the dismissal of an appeal, the clerk shall return to the court below the record on appeal with a certificate under the seal of the court showing that the appeal has been dismissed. Upon the receipt of such certificate in the lower court the case shall stand there as though no appeal had ever been taken, and the judgment of the said court may be enforced with the additional costs allowed by the appellate court upon dismissing the appeal.â xxx xxx xxx âSEC. 4. Withdrawal of appeal.-- An appeal may be withdrawn as of right at any time before the filing of appelleeâs brief. x x x. The withdrawal of an appeal shall have the same effect as that of a dismissal in accordance with section 2 of this rule.â Respondentâs explanation misses the point. True, he withdrew his appeal. But it is likewise true that he had actually filed an appeal, and that this was perfected. False then is his statement that no appeal was perfected in the injunction suit. Worse, he made the statement before this Court in order to exculpate himself, though in vain, from the charge of forum shopping. A lawyer must be a disciple of truth. Under the Code of Professional Responsibility, he owes candor, fairness and good faith to the courts.[37] He shall neither do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any. He also has a duty not to mislead or allow the courts to be misled by any artifice.[38] For this offense, we suspend the respondent from the practice of law for another year. True, in Ordonio vs. Eduarte,[39] Porac Trucking, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals[40] and Erectors, Inc. vs. NLRC,[41] we imposed a suspension of only six months for a similar malfeasance. But in Floresâ case, his falsehood is aggravated by its brazenness, for it was committed in an attempt, vain as it was, to cover up his forum shopping. Before we close, we note that this simple case was referred to the IBP on September 27, 1993. It was deemed submitted for resolution per the investigating commissionerâs order dated May 10, 1995. However, the investigating commissioner submitted his report only on May 5, 1997. Moreover, the IBP transmitted its recommendation to the Court only through a letter dated July 31, 1997, which was received by the Office of the Bar Confidant on August 15, 1997. Why it took the IBP almost four years to finish its investigation of the case and over two years from the date the parties filed their last pleadings to resolve it escapes us. After all, the case did not require any trial-type investigation, and the parties submitted only documentary evidence to prove or rebut their respective cases. Thus, we find it opportune to urge the IBP to hasten the disposition of administrative cases and to remind it that this Court gives it only ninety days to finish its investigation, report and recommendation. Should it require more time, it should file with the Court a request for extension, giving the reason for such request. WHEREFORE, for trifling with judicial processes by resorting to forum shopping, Respondent Ernesto B. Flores is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of ONE (1) YEAR and, for violating his oath and the Canon of Professional Responsibility to do no falsehood, he is SUSPENDED for another period of ONE (1) YEAR, resulting in a total period of TWO (2) YEARS, effective upon finality of this Decision. He is WARNED that a repetition of a similar misconduct will be dealt with more severely. Let a copy of this Decision be included in his files which are with the Office of the Bar Confidant, and circularized to all courts and to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. SO ORDERED.

ERNESTO B. FLORES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nThe profession\nof law exacts the highest standards from its members and brooks no violation of\nits code of conduct. Accordingly, a\nlawyer who trifles with judicial processes, engages in forum shopping and\nblatantly lies in his pleadings must be sanctioned.\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is an\nadministrative complaint against Atty. Ernesto Flores filed by Benguet Electric\nCooperative, Inc. (BENECO) before this Court on July 5, 1993, seeking his\nremoval or suspension from the bar for forum shopping, which amounted to âgrave\nmisconduct, x x x unduly delaying the administration of justice, and violating\nwith impunity his oath of office and applicable laws and jurisprudence.â [1]\n\nAfter the\nrespondent submitted his Comment, dated August 21, 1993, we referred the case\nto the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) on September 27, 1993 for\ninvestigation, report and recommendation. On August 15, 1997, we received a resolution from the IBP Board of\nGovernors, finding respondent guilty of violating Canons 10 and 12 of the Code\nof Professional Responsibility and recommending his suspension from the\npractice of law for a period of six months, viz : âRESOLUTION NO. XII-97-149 Adm. Case NO. 4058 Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. Atty. Ernesto B. Flores RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby\nADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating\nCommissioner in the above-entitled case, hereinmade [sic] part of this\nResolution/Decision as Annex âAâ; and finding the recommendation therein to be\nfully supported by the evidence on record and the applicable laws and rules,\nRespondent Atty. Ernesto Flores is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law\nfor six (6) months for violating the provision of Canon[s] 10 and 12 of the\nCode of Professional Responsibility.â [2]\n\nThe Facts\n\nBecause the\nparties [3] agreed to dispense with the\npresentation of testimonial evidence, the case was submitted for resolution on\nthe basis of their documentary evidence. As found by Investigating Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose, the facts are\nas follows: âx x x. On\nFebruary 25, 1993, Labor Arbiter Irenarco Rimando of the National Labor\nRelations Commission, Regional Arbitration Branch, Cordillera Administrative\nRegion, Baguio City, issued a Writ of Execution (x x x) in NLRC Case No.\nRAB-1-0313-84 to enforce the decision rendered by the Supreme Court on May 18,\n1992 in G.R. No. 89070 (Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. NLRC, 209 SCRA\n55). The Writ of Execution was issued\non motion of Benguet Electric Cooperative (BENECO for short) to collect the\namount of P 344,000.00 which it paid to Peter Cosalan during the pendency\nof the case before the Supreme Court, on the basis of its decision ordering the\nrespondent board members âto reimburse petitioner BENECO any amount that it may\nbe compelled to pay to respondent Cosalan by virtue of the decision of Labor\nArbiter Amado T. Adquilen.â After issuance of the writ of execution, the\nrespondent, as new counsel for the losing litigant-members of the BENECO Board\nof Directors, filed a Motion for Clarification with the Third Division of the\nSupreme Court in G.R. No. 89070, the minute resolution to wit: âto note without action the aforesaid\nmotionâ. Thereafter, the respondent instituted a suit docketed\nas Civil Case NO. 2738-R (x x x) with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 7,\nBaguio City, seeking to enjoin the defendants Clerk of Court, et al. from levying\non their properties in satisfaction of the said writ of execution. That case, however, was dismissed by the\nPresiding Judge Clarence Villanueva in his Order dated March 18, 1993 (x x x). Accordingly, the Office of the Clerk of Court, MTC,\nBaguio City, through Sheriff III Wilfredo Mendez, proceeded to levy on the\nproperties of the losing board members of BENECO. Thus, a sale at public auction was set on June 1, 1993, at 10:00\noâclock in the morning in front of the Baguio City Hall, per Sheriffâs Notice\nof Sale dated May 4, 1993 (x x x), of the properties of Abundio Awal and\nNicasio Aliping[,] two of the losing members of the Board of Directors of\nBENECO in the aforementioned case. Respondent claims in his comment (x x x) that Branch\n7, motu proprio, dismissed Civil Case No. 2738-R for lack of jurisdiction on\nMarch 18,1993, which dismissal was [sic] became final due to respondentâs\nfailure to perfect an appeal therefrom which claim according to the\ncomplainant, constitute[s] deliberate misrepresentation, if not falsehood,\nbecause the respondent indeed interposed an appeal such that on May 11, 1993,\nthe RTC 7 of Baguio City transmitted the entire record of Civil Case No. 2738-R\nto the Court of Appeals per certified machine copy of the letter transmittal of\nsame date (x x x). While respondent ânever essentially intended to\nassail the issuance by the NLRC of the Writ of Execution x x x nor sought to\nundo itâ (x x x) the complaint in Civil Case No. 2738-R which he filed prays\nfor the immediate issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary\nwrit of injunction for defendants Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio City Sheriff to\ncease and desist from enforcing the\nexecution and levy of the writ of execution issued by the NLRC-CAR, pending\nresolution of the main action in said court (x x x) which complainant likewise\nclaims as an unprocedural maneuver to frustrate the execution of the decision\nof the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 89070 in complete disregard of settled\njurisprudence that regular courts have no jurisdiction to hear and decide\nquestions which arise and are incidental to the enforcement of decisions,\norders and awards rendered in labor cases citing the case of Cangco vs. CA, 199\nSCRA 677, a display of gross ignorance of the law. On May\n26, 1993, respondent again filed for Abundio Awal and Nicasio Aliping with the\nRegional Trial Court, Branch 9, La Trinidad, Benguet, separate complaints for\nJudicial Declaration of Family Home Constituted, Ope Lege, and thus Exempt from\nLevy and Execution the subject properties with Damages, etc. docketed as Civil\nCases Nos. 93-F-0414 (x x x) and 93-F-0415 (x x x), which are essentially\nsimilar actions to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment rendered in NLRC Case\nNo. RAB-1-0313-84. He also filed an\nurgent Motion Ex-parte (x x x) praying for temporary restraining order in these\ntwo (2) cases. The complainant further alleges that respondentâs\nclaim for damages against the defendant Sheriff is another improper and\nunprocedural maneuver which is likewise a violation of respondentâs oath not to\nsue on groundless suit since the said Sheriff was merely enforcing a writ of\nexecution as part of his job.â\n\nRecommendation of the IBP\n\nAs noted\nearlier, Investigating Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose recommended, and the IBP\nBoard of Governors concurred, that respondent be suspended from the bar for six\nmonths for:\n\n1. Falsehood,\nfor stating in his comment before this Court that the order of the RTC\ndismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. 2738-R was not appealed on time\n\n2. Failure\nto comply with Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 on forum shopping Commissioner Jose ratiocinated: âA cursory glance of (sic) x x x\nthe complaint filed by the respondent in Civil Case No. 2738-R before the RTC\nof Baguio City, which complaint was signed and verified under oath by the\nrespondent, reveals that it lacks the certification required by Supreme Court\nCircular No. 28-91 which took effect on January 1, 1992 to the effect that âto\nthe best of his knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending in the\nSupreme Court, Court of Appeals or different divisions thereof or any tribunal\nor agency. If there is any other action\npending, he must state the status of the same. If he should learn that a similar action or proceeding has been filed or\npending before the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals or different divisions\nthereof or any tribunal or agency[,] he should notify the court, tribunal or\nagency within five (5) days from such notice.â âAmong the other penalties, the\nsaid circular further provides that the lawyer may also be subjected to\ndisciplinary proceedings for non-compliance thereof. âIn sum, it is clear that the\nrespondent violated the provisions of Canon[s] 10 and 12 of the Code of\nProfessional Responsibility under which the lawyer owes candor, fairness and\ngood faith to the court and exert[s] every effort and consider[s] it his duty\nto assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.â [4]\n\nThis Courtâs Ruling\n\nWe adopt and\naffirm the recommendation of the IBP suspending the respondent from the bar,\nbut we increase the period from six (6) months to one (1) year and six (6)\nmonths.\n\nForum Shopping\n\nCircular No.\n28-91, [5] dated\nSeptember 4, 1991 which took effect on January 1, 1992, requires a certificate\nof non-forum shopping to be attached to petitions filed before this Court and\nthe Court of Appeals. This circular was\nrevised on February 8, 1994. The IBP\nfound that the respondent had violated it, because the complaint he filed\nbefore the RTC of Baguio City âlack[ed] the certification required by Supreme\nCourt Circular No. 28-91.â [6]\n\nWe\ndistinguish. Respondentâs failure to\nattach the said certificate cannot be deemed a violation of the aforementioned\ncircular, because the said requirement applied only to petitions filed with\nthis Court and the Court of Appeals. [7] Likewise\ninapplicable is Administrative Circular No. 04-94 dated February 8, 1994 which\nextended the requirement of a certificate of non-forum shopping to all\ninitiatory pleadings filed in all courts and quasi-judicial agencies other than\nthis Court and the Court of Appeals. Circular No. 04-94 became effective only on April 1, 1994, but the\nassailed complaint for injunction was filed on March 18, 1993, and the petition\nfor the constitution of a family home was instituted on May 26, 1993.\n\nBe that as it\nmay, respondent is still guilty of forum shopping. In Chemphil Export and Import Corporation vs. Court of\nAppeals, [8] this\nCourt declared that â(t)he rule against forum shopping has long been\nestablished and subsequent circulars [9] of this\nCourt merely formalized the prohibition and provided the appropriate penalties\nagainst transgressors.â The prohibition\nis found in Section 1(e) of Rule 16 and Section 4 of Rule 2 of the 1964 Rules\nof Court, which provide: âSECTION 1. Grounds. -- Within the time for\npleading, a motion to dismiss the action may be made on any of the following\ngrounds:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(e) That\nthere is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause;\n\nxxx xxx xxx [10] âSEC. 4. Effect of splitting a\nsingle cause of action . -- If two or more complaints are brought for\ndifferent parts of a single cause of action, the filing of the first may be\npleaded in abatement of the other or others, in accordance with section 1 (e) of\nRule 16, and a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a bar in the\nothers.â [11]\n\nThe prohibition\nis also contained in Circular No. 28-91. This circular did not only\nrequire that a certification of non-forum shopping be attached to the petitions\nfiled before this Court or the Court of Appeals; it also decreed that forum\nshopping constituted direct contempt of court and could subject the offending lawyer to disciplinary action. The third paragraph thereof reads: â3. Penalties.\n\n(a) Any violation of this Circular\nshall be a cause for the summary dismissal of the multiple petition or\ncomplaint.\n\n(b) Any willful and deliberate\nforum shopping by any party and his lawyer wit the filing of multiple petitions\nand complaints to ensure favorable action shall constitute direct contempt of\ncourt .\n\n(c) The submission of false\ncertification under Par. 2 of the Circular shall likewise constitute contempt\nof Court, without prejudice to the filing of criminal action against the guilty\nparty. The lawyer may also be\nsubjected to disciplinary proceedings .â (Underscoring supplied.)\n\nThe foregoing\nwere substantially reproduced in Revised Circular No. 28-91 [12] and Administrative Circular No.\n04-94. [13]\n\nIn a long line\nof cases, this Court has held that forum shopping exists when, as a result of\nan adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than\nby appeal or certiorari) in another, [14] or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble\nthat one or the other court would make a favorable disposition. [15] The most\nimportant factor in determining the existence of forum shopping is the\nâvexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different\ncourts to rule on the same or related causes or grant the same or substantially\nthe same reliefs.â [16]\n\nAfter this Court\nrendered its Decision [17] in Benguet Electric Cooperative,\nInc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al. [18] and upon motion\nof BENECO, Labor Arbiter Irenarco R. Rimando issued a writ of execution [19] ordering\nthe clerk of court and ex officio city sheriff of the Municipal Trial Court of\nBaguio City to levy on and sell at public auction personal and real property of\nthe members of the Board of Directors of BENECO.\n\nOn March 18,\n1993, Respondent Flores, acting as counsel for BENECO Board Members Victor\nLaoyan, Nicasio Aliping, Lorenzo Pilando and Abundio Awal, filed with the RTC\nan injunction suit praying for the issuance of a temporary restraining order\n(TRO) âto preserve the status quo as now obtaining between the parties,â\nas well as a writ of preliminary preventive injunction ordering the clerk of\ncourt and the ex officio city sheriff of the MTC of Baguio to âcease and desist\nfrom enforcing by execution and levy the writ of execution from the NLRC-CAR,\npending resolution of the main action raised in court.â [20]\n\nWhen this\ninjunction case was dismissed, Respondent Flores filed with another branch of\nthe RTC two identical but separate actions both entitled âJudicial Declaration\nof Family Home Constituted, ope lege , Exempt from Levy and\nExecution; with Damages, etc.,â docketed as Civil Case Nos. 93-F-0414 and\n93-F-0415. [21] The said\ncomplaints were supplemented by an âUrgent Motion Ex Parteâ [22] which\nprayed for an order to temporarily restrain Sheriff Wilfredo V. Mendez from\nproceeding with the auction sale of plaintiffsâ property âto avoid rendering\nineffectual and functus [oficio] any judgment of the court later in this [sic]\ncases, until further determined by the court.â\n\nCivil Case Nos.\n93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415 are groundless suits. Modequillo vs. Breva , [23] reiterated in Manacop vs. Court of Appeals , [24] shows the\nfrivolity of these proceedings: âUnder the Family Code, a family\nhome is deemed constituted on a house and lot from the time it is occupied as a\nfamily residence. There is no need to\nconstitute the same judicially or extrajudicially as required in the Civil\nCode. If the family actually resides in\nthe premises, it is, therefore, a family home as contemplated by law. Thus, the creditors should take the\nnecessary precautions to protect their interest before extending credit to the\nspouses or head of the family who owns the home.\n\nxxx. The exemption provided as\naforestated is effective from the time of the constitution of the family home\nas such, and lasts so long as any of its beneficiaries actually resides\ntherein.â\n\nAdhering to the\nCourtâs declaration in said cases, the subject properties are deemed\nconstituted as family homes by operation of law under Article 153 of the Family\nCode.\n\nThe suits for\nthe constitution of a family home were not only frivolous and unnecessary; they were clearly asking for reliefs\nidentical to the prayer previously dismissed by another branch of the RTC, i.e., to forestall the execution of a final judgment of the labor arbiter. That they were filed ostensibly for the judicial declaration of a family home was a mere smoke screen; in\nessence, their real objective was to restrain or delay the enforcement of the\nwrit of execution. In his deliberate\nattempt to obtain the same relief in two different courts, Respondent Flores\nwas obviously shopping for a âfriendlyâ forum which would capitulate to his improvident\nplea for an injunction and was thereby trifling with the judicial process. [25]\n\nWe remind the\nrespondent that, under the Code of Professional Responsibility, [26] he had a\nduty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. [27] The Code\nalso enjoins him from unduly delaying a case by impeding the execution of a\njudgment or by misusing court processes. [28]\n\nIn consonance\nwith Millare vs. Montero [29] and Garcia vs. Francisco , [30] respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for one year. In Millare , the respondent filed with\ndifferent courts a total of six appeals, complaints and petitions which\nfrustrated and delayed the execution of a final judgment. Holding that ârespondent âmade a mockery of\nthe judicial processesâ and disregarded canons of professional ethics in\nintentionally frustrating the rights of a litigant in whose favor a judgment in\nthe case was rendered [and], thus, âabused procedural rules to defeat the ends\nof substantial justice,ââ [31] this\nCourt suspended the respondent from the practice of law for one year.\n\nIn Garcia ,\nthe respondent was also suspended for one year from the practice of law, for\nviolating the proscription against forum shopping. This Court held that âhe deserve[d] to be sanctioned, not only as\na punishment for his misconduct but also as a warning to other lawyers who may\nbe influenced by his example.â [32]\n\nFalsehood\n\nThe\ninvestigating commissioner also held respondent liable for committing a\nfalsehood because, in this administrative case, he stated in his comment that\nhe had not âperfected an appeal on the dismissalâ of his petition for\ninjunction. In his said comment, the\nrespondent stated: âBranch 7 (of the RTC) motu\nproprio , dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on March 18,\n1993. Not having perfected an appeal\non the dismissal , the order of dismissal became final under the Rules 15\ndays after its receipt by respondent on record, or before April 6, 1993. So that today this case is no longer\npending .\n\nxxx. It should be noted that when Civil\nCase Nos. 93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415 for family homes and damages were filed in\nthe court below on May 26, 1993, Civil Case NO. 2378-R which seems to give\nbasis to the present Complaint was deemed terminated, there being no appeal\nformally taken and perfected in accordance with the Rules .\n\nxxx. And that precisely was the primal\nreason why respondent decided not to appeal any further anymore [sic] the order\nof dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the court below in Civil Case No.\n2738, and let it be deemed final by the Rules and jurisprudence.â [33] (Underscoring supplied.)\n\nThe indelible\nfact, however, is that respondent did\nfile an appeal which was perfected later on. The original records of the injunction suit had been transmitted to the\nappellate court. [34] Moreover,\nthe Court of Appeals issued a resolution dismissing the appeal. [35] Thus, in\ndenying that he had appealed the decision of the RTC, respondent was making a\nfalse statement.\n\nRespondent\nargues that the withdrawal of his appeal means that no appeal was made under Section\n2 of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court. The\npertinent provisions of Rule 50 [36] read: âSEC. 2. Effect of dismissal .-- Fifteen (15) days after the\ndismissal of an appeal, the clerk shall return to the court below the record on\nappeal with a certificate under the seal of the court showing that the appeal\nhas been dismissed. Upon the receipt of\nsuch certificate in the lower court the case shall stand there as though no\nappeal had ever been taken, and the judgment of the said court may be enforced\nwith the additional costs allowed by the appellate court upon dismissing the\nappeal.â\n\nxxx xxx xxx âSEC. 4. Withdrawal of appeal .-- An appeal may be withdrawn as of\nright at any time before the filing of appelleeâs brief. x x x. The withdrawal of an appeal shall have the same effect as that of a\ndismissal in accordance with section 2 of this rule.â\n\nRespondentâs\nexplanation misses the point. True, he\nwithdrew his appeal. But it is likewise\ntrue that he had actually filed an appeal, and that this was perfected. False then is his statement that no appeal\nwas perfected in the injunction suit. Worse, he made the statement before this Court in order to exculpate\nhimself, though in vain, from the charge of forum shopping.\n\nA lawyer must be\na disciple of truth. Under the Code of\nProfessional Responsibility, he owes candor, fairness and good faith to the\ncourts. [37] He shall\nneither do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any. He also has a duty not to mislead or allow\nthe courts to be misled by any artifice. [38]\n\nFor this\noffense, we suspend the respondent from the practice of law for another\nyear. True, in Ordonio vs. Eduarte , [39] Porac\nTrucking, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals [40] and Erectors,\nInc. vs. NLRC, [41] we\nimposed a suspension of only six months for a similar malfeasance. But in Floresâ case, his falsehood is\naggravated by its brazenness, for it was committed in an attempt, vain as it\nwas, to cover up his forum shopping.\n\nBefore we close,\nwe note that this simple case was referred to the IBP on September 27,\n1993. It was deemed submitted for\nresolution per the investigating commissionerâs order dated May 10, 1995. However, the investigating commissioner\nsubmitted his report only on May 5, 1997. Moreover, the IBP transmitted its recommendation to the Court only\nthrough a letter dated July 31, 1997, which was received by the Office of the\nBar Confidant on August 15, 1997. Why\nit took the IBP almost four years to finish its investigation of the case and\nover two years from the date the parties filed their last pleadings to resolve\nit escapes us. After all, the case did\nnot require any trial-type investigation, and the parties submitted only\ndocumentary evidence to prove or rebut their respective cases. Thus, we find it opportune to urge the IBP\nto hasten the disposition of administrative cases and to remind it that this\nCourt gives it only ninety days to finish its investigation, report and\nrecommendation. Should it require more\ntime, it should file with the Court a request for extension, giving the reason\nfor such request.\n\nWHEREFORE , for trifling with judicial\nprocesses by resorting to forum shopping, Respondent Ernesto B. Flores is\nhereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of ONE (1) YEAR\nand, for violating his oath and the Canon of Professional Responsibility to do\nno falsehood, he is SUSPENDED for another period of ONE (1) YEAR,\nresulting in a total period of TWO (2) YEARS, effective upon finality of this\nDecision. He is WARNED that a\nrepetition of a similar misconduct will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet a copy of\nthis Decision be included in his files which are with the Office of the Bar\nConfidant, and circularized to all courts and to the Integrated Bar of the\nPhilippines.\n\nSO ORDERED.
