Nos. 139341-45, July 25, 2002 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ERNESTO FERNANDEZ, APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ERNESTO FERNANDEZ, APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nWhen the prosecutionâs evidence, consisting mainly of the \ncomplainantâs \ntestimony, fails the test of moral certainty demanded by the law and the\n rules, \nthe accused must be acquitted. It then becomes this Courtâs duty to \nuphold the \nconstitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent regardless \nof the \nweakness of the defense.\n\nThe Case\n\nFor automatic review before this Court is the September 30, \n1998 Decision [1] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Agoo, \nLa Union (Branch 32) in Criminal Case Nos. A-3177, A-3274, A-3275, \nA-3276 and \nA-3277, finding Ernesto Fernandez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of five\n (5) \ncounts of rape and sentencing him to death for each count. The decretal \nportion \nof the Decision reads:\n\nâWHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING consideration[s], the \naccused \nErnesto Fernandez a.k.a. âTang-kedâ is hereby found GUILTY of the five \n(5) \ncriminal cases for Rape for which he is charged and he is hereby \nsentenced in \nall the five (5) cases to suffer the extreme penalty of DEATH; to pay \nthe \ncomplainant Yolanda Fernandez damages in the amount of P50,000.00 in \neach case \nor P250,000.00 and to pay the cost of the proceedings.â [2]\n\nThe Information for Criminal Case No. A-3177 [3] dated November 29, \n1996, reads as \nfollows: [4]\n\nâThat on or about the 2nd day of October, 1995, in the \nMunicipality of Sto. \nTomas, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of\n this \nHonorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the father and \nperson-in-charge of the custody and care of the offended party, with \nlewd \ndesign, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have \nsexual \nintercourse with the offended party Yolanda Fernandez, a minor then \nfourteen \n(14) years old, to her damage and prejudice.â [5]\n\nThe four (4) other Informations (Criminal Case Nos. \nA-3274, [6] A-3275, [7] A-3276 [8] and \nA-3277, [9] all \ndated January 17, 1997) indicted \nappellant for the same crime against the same victim on four different \ndates, \nOctober 3, 4 and 15 -- all in 1995 -- and âin or about the month of \nApril 1996.â \nAppellant was arraigned twice, first on July 29, 1997 [10] for Criminal Case No.\n A-3177; and the \nsecond on September 17, 1997 [11] for \nCriminal Case Nos. A-3274 to A-3277. In both instances, appellant, with \nthe \nassistance of his counsel de parte, [12] pleaded not guilty. [13] After pretrial \nand trial in due course, the lower court rendered its assailed \nDecision.\n\nThe \nFacts\nVersion of the \nProsecution\n\nIn its Brief, [14] the Office of the \nSolicitor General (OSG) summarized the facts in the following \nmanner:\n\nâPrivate complainant Yolanda Fernandez is the illegitimate \ndaughter of \nappellant Ernesto Fernandez and Percilita Garcia. Percilita Garcia, on \nthe other \nhand, is appellantâs step-daughter, being the daughter of his common-law\n wife \nEspirita Costales with her first husband, who was then living with \nappellant in \nNamonitan, Sto. Tomas, La Union, when she was raped and impregnated by \nappellant. On October 10, 1982, Percilita Garcia, who was then 18 years \nold, \ngave birth out of wedlock to appellantâs child, complainant Yolanda \nFernandez, \nin appellantâs house in Namonitan, Sto. Tomas, La Union. After giving \nbirth to \nYolanda, Percilita went to live in her brother Ernesto Garciaâs house, \nalso in \nNamonitan, until she went to Manila in 1984 and stayed there for good, \nleaving \nYolanda to the care and custody of appellant and her mother \nEsperita.\n\nâSince birth, Yolanda lived with her father, appellant Ernesto \nFernandez, and \nher grandmother Espirita Costales, appellantâs common-law wife, in \nappellantâs \nhouse in Namonitan, Sto. Tomas, La Union. She went to school at Cupang \nElementary School in Namonitan, which was a walking distance from their \nhouse. \nShe was in Grade V when she was serially raped by [her] father, \nappellant \nErnesto Fernandez, inside their house starting October 2, 1995, which \nforced her \nto quit schooling. At the time, Yolanda was twelve (12) going [on] \nthirteen (13) \nyears old, and was living in the house of appellant together with \nappellant, her \ngrandmother Espirita Costales and her 5-year old sister Catherine \nFernan[d]ez \nwho is also appellant and Percilitaâs daughter. Previous to these rape \nincidents, appellant had started abusing Yolanda as early as when she \nwas five \n(5) years old by touching her breasts and other parts of the body.\n\nâTHE FIRST RAPE (Criminal Case No. \nA-3177)\n\nâOn October 2, 1995 at about 6:00 oâclock in the evening, \nYolanda was sitting \nin the sala of their house when appellant came near her. Just the two \n[of] them \nwere in the house at the time, because her grandmother and Catherine \nwere out \nselling fish. Appellant pulled her by the arm to her room which was \nlocated \nsouth of the sala of the house. As he pulled her towards her room, he \nwarned her \nnot to tell anyone. When they got inside the room, appellant undressed \nher, by \nremoving first her T-shirt, then her short pants, then her panty and \nbra. She \ntried to fight back, boxed his back, and tried to run away but appellant\n caught \nher and laid her down on her bed. After laying her down on the bed, he \nkissed \nher cheeks, her lips and on her breasts; touched her body and her \nprivate parts \nwith his hand; then he held his penis, opened her legs wide and inserted\n his \npenis into her vagina, and made pumping motions for a while. She felt \npain in \nher anybody [sic] because he would kill her, and then he left. She then \nput her \nclothes on.\n\nâTHE SECOND RAPE (Criminal Case No. \nA-3274)\n\nâOn October 3, 1995, at about 7:00 oâclock in the morning, \nwhile Yolanda was \nalone at the kitchen of their house washing the dishes, appellant \narrived and \npulled her inside his own room. There, he removed her dress (bestida), \nher bra \nand her panty, and laid her to his bed. She tried to run away but he \ncaught her. \nHe then laid her down on his bed and thereupon, inserted his penis and \nhad \nsexual intercourse with her. She felt pain inside her vagina. While \ndoing the \nact, appellant kissed her breasts, cheeks and lips. After the \nintercourse, \nappellant warned her that he would kill her should she report what \nhappened, \nthen he left.\n\nâTHE THIRD RAPE (Criminal Case No. \nA-3275)\n\nâOn October 4, 1995, at about 6:00 oâclock in the morning, \nYolanda was \nsweeping in the house when appellant kissed her all over her body and \nthen \npulled her to her room. Only she and the appellant were in the house at \nthe \ntime. Once inside her room, appellant removed first her skirt, then her \nblouse \nand then her bra and panty. When she was totally naked, he [lay] her \ndown on the \nbed. Despite her resistance by pushing him away, appellant again \nsucceeded in \ninserting his penis inside her vagina. He also kissed her. She felt pain\n in her \nvagina and in her breasts as he did the pumping motion. After the \nintercourse, \nappellant warned her, that he would kill her; then, he \nleft.\n\nâTHE FOURTH RAPE (Criminal Case No. \nA-3276)\n\nâOn October 15, 1995, at about 7:00 oâclock in the morning, \nYolanda was \nsitting alone in the kitchen of their house, as her grandmother and \nsister \nCatherine had already left to sell fish, when appellant approached and \npulled \nher towards her room. She tried to resist but he was very strong in \npulling her. \nOnce they got inside her room, appellant embraced her, kissed her cheeks\n and \nmashed her breasts. Then he undressed her and laid her on the bed. He \nagain \nwarned her not to reveal it to anybody, or he would kill her. Then he \nplaced \nhimself on top of her, inserted his penis inside her vagina and made a \npumping \nmotion. She felt pain in her vagina. It took appellant a few minutes to \nstay on \ntop of her. After consummating the sexual act, appellant left. Yolanda \nremained \ninside their house.\n\nâTHE FIFTH RAPE (Criminal Case No. \nA-3277)\n\nâAfter October 15, 1995, Yolanda was raped again and again, the\n dates and the \nnumber of times she could no longer remember nor recall. Even after she \nwas \nalready pregnant with appellantâs child, appellant still kept on raping \nher. On \nJuly 3, 1996, she gave birth in their house to appellantâs child, a baby\n girl \nwhom they named Marimar Fernandez.â [15] (Citations omitted)\n\nVersion of the \nDefense\n\nOn the other hand, appellantâs version of the facts is as \nfollows: [16]\n\nâThe defense presented the oral testimonies of Winifreda Butay \nand Ernesto \nFernandez.\n\nâThe first witness, Winifreda Butay, is a Chief of Police of \nBurgos, La \nUnion. Before she became Chief of Police of Burgos, La Union, she was \nassigned \nat the Womenâs Desk of San Fernando, La Union. On July 1997, she \naccompanied an \ninsane victim of a vehicular accident to the DSWD Substitute Home Care \nfor Women \nin Urayong, Bauang, La Union. While she was there, Yolanda Fernandez \napproached \nher and introduced herself that she was from San Fernando, La Union. She\n asked \nYolanda why she was there and the latter informed her that she was taken\n by the \nDSWD and NBI because she filed a rape case against her father. When she \nasked \nwhy she filed a rape case Yolanda answered that it was her mother who \ninstructed \nher to reveal that it was her father who raped her. She asked why, and \nYolanda \nsaid that her parents were quarreling. She further inquired as to who \nraped \nYolanda. The latter answered that it was her boyfriend, Jonathan Camiro.\n She \nsaid that when Yolanda was confiding to her, two (2) personnel of the \nDSWD were \nlistening to their conversation. The said personnel were Remelie \nGuillermo and \nEdwina Masi. While she was talking with Yolanda, the two (2) approached \nthem and \nsaid that Yolanda gave them the same story. She again asked Yolanda who \nraped \nher and why she filed a case against her own father. She gave the same \nanswer \nthat her mother taught her what to say and that it was her boyfriend who\n \nimpregnated her. During that time, the two (2) DSWD personnel were still\n \nlistening. She told the DSWD about the case and she was informed that \nthe DSWD \nalready sen[t] a written communication to the NBI, but the NBI, however,\n didnât \nrespond. She said that she received a letter from the mother of Yolanda \nprohibiting her from talking to or visiting Yolanda.\n\nâThe last witness, Ernesto Fernandez, is the accused[.] He \nadmitted that he \nis the father of the alleged victim but said that Catherine is not [his]\n \ndaughter because Percy gave birth in Manila. He denied vehemently the \nrape \ncharges filed against him but admitted that he tied Yolanda to a mango \ntree to \nforce her to admit as to who impregnated her. However, he denied kicking\n her \nabdomen to abort the baby. The uncle of Yolanda talked to her and the \nlatter \nadmitted to her uncle that it was Jonathan Camiro who got her pregnant. \nUpon \nknowing this, he asked a Barangay councilman to talk to the father of \nJonathan, \nbut the latter denied that he impregnated Yolanda. During the dates of \nthe \nalleged rapes, he was working at San Fernando, Pampanga. On June 26, \n1996, the \nDSWD personnel and the assigned NBI Agent went to their house to get \nYolanda, \nwhom he voluntarily allowed to go with them. He didnât know where they \nbrought \nYolanda. He only came to know that a complaint was filed against him \nwhen he \nreceived a subpoena requiring him to file a counter-affidavit which he \nidentified in open court.â [17] (Citations \nomitted)\n\nRuling of the Trial \nCourt\n\nThe RTC gave full credence to the testimony of complainant, \nnoting that âshe \nnarrated the circumstances before, during and after the alleged rape in a\n \npositive and straightforward manner.â [18] On her part, no ill motive for accusing her own father of the crime of \nrape was \nfound by the trial court. [19]\n\nHaving accepted complainantâs testimony, the RTC ruled that \nappellant had \nindeed succeeded in having carnal knowledge of his daughter who, at the \ntime of \nthe rape, was under eighteen years of age. It sentenced him to death, \none each \nfor the five (5) counts of rape he had been charged with.\n\nHence, this automatic review. [20]\n\nIssues\n\nIn his Brief, appellant faults the RTC with this lone \nassignment of \nerror:\n\nâThe lower court gravely erred in imposing the death penalty \nupon \naccused-appellant despite the failure of the prosecution to prove the \nreal age \nof the victim.â [21]\n\nThe Courtâs \nRuling\n\nThe appeal is meritorious; the prosecutionâs evidence does not \npass the test \nof moral certainty. Hence, appellant must be acquitted.\n\nMain \nIssue:\nSufficiency of Prosecution \nEvidence\n\nAppellant did not raise the sufficiency of the prosecutionâs \nevidence as an \nissue. This Court, however, looked into it motu proprio, consistent with\n the \nprinciple that an appeal in a criminal action opens the whole case for \nreview. [22]\n\nAny review of a rape case begins with the settled reality that \naccusing a \nperson of this crime can be done with facility. [23] Thus, the testimony of the \ncomplainant \nmust always be scrutinized with great caution. [24] It may not be easy for her to prove\n the \ncommission of rape; yet, it is even more difficult for the accused, \nthough \ninnocent, to disprove his guilt. [25] This \nprinciple must be viewed in relation to that which holds that the \nevidence for \nthe prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits; it cannot draw \nstrength \nfrom the weakness of the evidence for the defense. [26]\n\nTo be sure, it is the primordial duty of the prosecution to \npresent its side \nwith clarity and persuasion, so that conviction becomes the only logical\n and \ninevitable conclusion. What is required of it is to justify the \nconviction of \nthe accused with moral certainty. [27] Upon the prosecutionâs failure to meet this test, acquittal becomes the \nconstitutional duty of the Court, lest its mind be tortured with the \nthought \nthat it has imprisoned an innocent man for the rest of his life [28] or, worse -- as in \nthis case -- put him \nto death.\n\nComplainantâs Dubious \nTestimony\n\nThe court a quo describes the testimony of\n the victim as âpositive, \nstraightforward, explicit and spontaneousâ; [29] hence, sufficient to convict \nappellant of \nrape. This Court believes otherwise.\n\nWe are not unmindful of the general rule that the findings of \nthe trial court \nregarding the credibility of witnesses are generally accorded great \nrespect and \neven finality on appeal. [30] However, \nthis principle does not preclude a reevaluation of the evidence to \ndetermine \nwhether material facts or circumstances have been overlooked or \nmisinterpreted \nby the trial court. [31] In the past, we \nhave not hesitated to reverse judgments of conviction, where there were \nstrong \nindications pointing to the possibility that the rape charge was \nfalse. [32]\n\nAfter a judicious examination of complainantâs testimony, which\n is the main \nevidence for the allegation of rape, we cannot subscribe to the RTCâs \nassessment \nof it as straightforward and unwavering. Quite the contrary, we believe \nthat no \nconviction can arise from it on the following grounds.\n\nUnreliability\n\nComplainant testified that the first incident of rape happened \non October 2, \n1995, at 6:00 p.m. [33] But on \ncross-examination, she testified that on the afternoon of that day, she \nwent out \nto fetch her Inang . [34] It would \nhave been a simple matter to reconcile these two events, if complainant \nsimply \nclarified that one happened after the other. Surprisingly, during her \ndirect \nexamination, she did not even remember that she had gone out to pick up \nher Inang that afternoon.\n\nWhat baffles this Court is the fact that complainant was sure \nof the time of \nthe alleged rape; she was likewise sure of the time her Inang arrived. [35] But \nthe girl could not \nremember what time she had gone out to fetch her grandmother. \nComplainant could \nhave easily estimated the time she had done so, if indeed the events \ntranspired \nas she recounted them, because one event logically followed the \nother.\n\nThe same recall selectiveness is repeated in her testimony as \nto the alleged \nsecond and third incidents of rape. On direct examination, she claimed \nthat on \nOctober 3, 1995, she was raped for the second time at 7:00 a.m. [36] But on cross-examination, she said that she had just left her Inang at \nthat same time in the place where the latter was to get a ride. [37] As to the third \nincident of rape \nallegedly committed on October 4, 1995, complainant testified that she \nwas raped \nat 6:00 a.m. [38] Again, on \ncross-examination, she declared that at that very same time, she and her\n sister \nCatherine had brought their Inang to the place \nwhere the old lady would \nget a ride. [39]\n\nAs before, following the narration of events given by \ncomplainant, one can \nlogically infer that after the rape, she accompanied her grandmother up \nto the \nplace where the latter would get a ride; or the other way around -- \nafter \nfetching her Inang , she returned home and was \nraped. However, \ncomplainant could make no such connection between the two events. The \nonly way \nto reconcile these events is to suppose that they happened in \nsuccession, but \nher failure to recall a closely connected sequence of events immediately\n \npreceding or succeeding the supposed rape [40] casts doubt on the veracity of her \nstatements and erodes her credibility. [41]\n\nThe pattern that emerged was that when defense counsel made no \nreference to \nthe supposed rape incident, she became unsure whether her testimony \nduring \ndirect examination on the alleged rape coincided with the times of the \nactivities she mentioned at the latter portion of the \ncross-examination.\n\nThese discrepancies were material. Yet, they were not explained\n in the direct \nor redirect examinations even when the trial was continued on succeeding\n dates. \nNeither were they discussed in the Decision of the trial \ncourt.\n\nInconsistency\n\nA careful analysis of the testimony of complainant will reveal \nthat she kept \non giving statements that were inconsistent or contradictory.\n\nFirst, she testified that she stopped \nschooling in October 1995, \nbecause her stomach was already bulging due to her pregnancy. [42] She categorically \ndeclared that she became \npregnant because appellant had raped her. [43] But later, still on direct examination, \nshe averred that she was raped for the first time on October 2, 1995. \nShe \ntestified:\n\nâQ When for the first time did this Ernesto Fernandez [rape] \nyou?\nA \nOctober 2, sir.\n\nQ What year?\nA In 1995, sir.â [44]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nâQ But you claimed that he only raped you for the first time on\n October 2, \n1995?\nA Yes, sir.â [45]\n\nIt bewilders this Court how she could have stopped schooling in\n October 1995 \ndue to her pregnancy, which allegedly resulted from the first instance \nof rape \ncommitted by appellant, also in October of that same year. She said, in \nfact, \nthat her stomach was already âbulgingâ [46] at this time. If such were the case, then \nnot only did her pregnancy occur simultaneously with the first rape but,\n more \nincredibly, her pregnancy preceded the \nrape.\n\nSecond, in her testimony she alleged that \nat the time of the second \nrape, she was on her way to school. [47] This allegation contradicted her earlier statements, during both the \ndirect and \nthe redirect examinations, [48] that she \nhad already stopped schooling on October 2, 1995.\n\nThird, when asked by the public prosecutor\n what she did after that \nrape, she said that âshe left their house to go to her Uncle \nBoyet.â [49] But \nwhen asked the same question by the \ntrial court, again she responded, âI went to school.â [50]\n\nFourth, she also said in her testimony \nthat on October 4, 1995, she \nwas with her sister Catherine when they brought their grandmother to the\n place \nwhere the woman would get her ride. Almost in the same breath, though, \ncomplainant said that she and her sister went home. Later, the former \nclarified \nthat on that date, she went home while her sister Catherine accompanied \ntheir \ngrandmother in selling fish. [51]\n\nInadequacy\n\nShowing lack of substance in her testimony, complainant could \nnot even relate \ndetails of the final rape allegedly committed sometime in April 1996. \nBesides \ngiving no details, she gave the impression that the occurrence itself \nwas \ndoubtful. When questioned by the trial court, she testified \nthus:\n\nâCOURT QUESTION:\n\nQ. How about in the year 1996, do you remember if you were \nraped by him?\nA \nNo more.â [52]\n\nComplainantâs Perfunctory Manner of Testifying\n\nAlthough it is settled that the accused may be convicted of \nrape simply on \nthe basis of the complainantâs testimony, [53] this principle holds true only if such \ntestimony meets the test of credibility. [54] This requires that the testimony be \nstraightforward, clear, positive and convincing.\n\nWhat particularly caught the Courtâs attention was the manner \nin which \ncomplainant gave her testimony. We note that all the major circumstances\n before, \nduring and immediately after the alleged rape were indirectly provided \nby the \nprosecutor through his questions. In fact, when one sifts through the \ntestimony \nof complainant, it becomes evident that she simply affirmed, denied or \nsupplied \nthe missing facts in response to the questions propounded by him. Such \ntestimony \ncannot be considered positive or categorical.\n\nAlthough the trend in procedural law is to give wide latitude \nto the \nquestioning of a child witness, [55] we \nmust not lose track of the basic tenet that the truth must be \nascertained.\n\nWhen one scrutinizes the testimony of complainant, one will \neasily notice \nthat her manner of testifying seems to be so mechanical that, in the \nalleged \nfour instances of rape, both her actuation and that of appellant were \nalmost \nalways identical. To the Court, her narration seemed to come from \nmemorization \nby rote, rather than genuine recollection, and thus sounded perfunctory \nor \nroutinary. Moreover, when asked questions on events contemporaneous or \nimmediately before or after the alleged rape, she seemed to falter in \ngiving \nimmediate, positive and categorical responses.\n\nOwing to the character of the crime of rape, the testimony of \nthe victim is \nthe focal point around which the charges naturally revolve. Therefore, \nthe \ndegree of reliability, consistency and adequacy of her testimony on \nmaterial \npoints -- as well as the very manner in which she gives such testimony \n-- can \neither sustain or negate conviction. [56]\n\nTainted Testimony \nof\nComplainantâs Mother\n\nIt is clear that conviction may arise from any categorical and \nconsistent \npositive identification, absent any showing of ill motive on the part of\n the \neyewitness testifying on the matter. In a litany of cases, this Court \nhas ruled \nthat when there is no showing of any improper motive on the part of the \nvictim \nto testify falsely against the accused or to falsely implicate the \nlatter in the \ncommission of the crime, the logical conclusion is that no such improper\n motive \nexists, and that the testimony is worthy of full faith and \ncredence. [57] Further, this Court has reiterated time \nand time again that it is most unlikely for a young girl like \ncomplainant, or \neven her family, to impute the crime of rape to no less than a relative \nand to \nface social humiliation, if not to vindicate her honor. [58]\n\nHowever settled these principles, they do not apply to the case\n at bar. We \nnote from Defense Witness Winifreda Butayâs testimony that complainant \nadmitted \nto having been instructed by her mother to testify to having been raped \nby the \nfather. We also had the occasion to examine the testimony of \ncomplainantâs \nmother, who openly testified how she herself had allegedly been raped by\n \nappellant. [59] Without passing judgment \non that incident, we note the animosity she felt towards him. The \nmotherâs ill \nmotive clearly supported Butayâs testimony that complainant had accused \nher \nfather of raping her after being coached by her own mother to do so. \nThis point \nwill be discussed shortly.\n\nUnrebutted Testimony \nof\nCredible Defense \nWitness\n\nMost damaging to the cause of the prosecution was the testimony\n referred to \nabove -- that of Defense Witness Winifreda Butay, a police officer \nassigned to \nthe Womenâs Desk of Burgos, La Union. In July 1997, she accompanied \ncomplainant \nto the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Substitute \nHome Care \nfor Women in Urayong, Bauang, La Union. Having had the opportunity to \ninterview \ncomplainant, Butay testified as follows:\n\nâQ And what happened with this Yolanda Fernandez when she saw \nyou?\nA When \nthis victim saw me, I ask her from where she is and she told me that \n[she is] \nfrom Sto. Tomas, La Union.\n\nQ What happened next?\nA I asked her name and she \nuttered Yolanda \nFernandez.\n\nQ After she told you her name, what happened next?\nA I\n inquired from \nher.\n\nQ What did you inquire from her?\nA I inquired from \nher, what happened to \nher.\n\nQ And what was the answer of Yolanda Fernandez?\nA She \nwas taken by the \nDSWD and NBI for them to [take] care of her or custody of her and she \ntold me \nalso that she filed a case [of rape] against her father, Ernesto \nFernandez.\n\nQ And when she told you tha[t], what happened or what did you \ndo?\nA I \nasked her, why she filed a case against her father and she told me that \nher \nmother taught her that she will tell that her father was the one who \nraped \nher.\n\nQ And did you ask her why did her mother [teach] her to file a \ncase against \nher father?\n\nPROS. CATBAGAN:\n\nObjection, your honor, that is only a \nhearsay.\n\nCOURT:\n\nObjection over[r]uled, that is a \nconversation.\n\nWhat was the answer?\nA She told me that her mother and\n father are \nquar[r]eling.\n\nQ Could you quote the exact Ilocano dialect before this Court \n[what] she told \nyou?\nA Yes sir.\n\nQ What was it?\nA I ask[ed] her âApay nga indarum mo ni\n tatang mo ti rapeâ \n(Why did you charge your father with rape) and she answered âIsumet \nngamin ti \ninbaga ni Nanang koâ, nga idarum ko ni tatang ko ti rapeâ, and after \nthat I \nask[ed] her did your father rape you and she said no and then I asked \nher again \nwho is then the person who raped you, she answered âdidiay nobyokâ (my \nboyfriend).\n\nQ Did you [ask] her the name of her suitor?\nA Yes \nsir.\n\nQ And what was the answer that was revealed?\nA My \nboyfriend Jonathan \nCamiro.\n\nQ And what else did she [reveal] to you regarding Jonathan \nCamiro?\nA I \nasked he[r], is it not true that he was the one who raped you.\n\nQ And what was the answer of Yolanda Fernandez?\nA He \nwas the one.â [60]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nâQ And what did she say to them\nA And what she said to\n them she also told \nme.\n\nQ And what is that?\nA She said: (âIsu met ti imbaga ni\n Nanangcoâ) That is \nwhat my mother said.\n\nQ What [was] Yolanda Fernandez referring to?\nA Yolanda\n Fernandez told me \nâthat it was not my father who impregnated meâ she said.\n\nQ Did you ask Yolanda Fernandez who impregnated her?\nA\n Yes, your honor, \nand said: âmy boyfriend Jonathan Camiro.â\n\nQ Where [were] these two DSWD [personnel] when Yolanda \nFernandez told you \nthat?\nA They were in front of me, your honor.\n\nQ How far Madam witness?\nA This far, sir. (Witness is \npointing to one-half \nmeter).\n\nQ Did you ask Yolanda Fernandez if she was actually raped by \n[her] \nfather?\nA Yes, and she told me again: âSaan nga ni tatangco ti \nnangsicog \ncaniac.â (It was not my father who made me pregnant).\n\nQ Did you ever ask her why she filed the case against her \nfather?\nA Yes, \nyour honor.\n\nQ And what was the answer?\nA I asked her: âwhy then \ndid you file a case \nagainst your father or why is it [that it is] your father whom you \ncharged?â \n(Apay ngarud nga ni tatangmo ti indarum mo?).\n\nQ And what was the answer?\nA Yes, because that is what\n my mother told me \n(Wen ta isu met ngarud ti imbaga ni nanangco cania).\n\nQ Did you ask her why her mother want[s] her to charge Ernesto \nFernandez?\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And what was the answer?\nA She told me in Ilocano \nagain. (Wen ta \nagap-apada). Yes because they are quarreling.â [60]\n\nWe find no logical reason for Witness Butay to testify falsely.\n The public \nprosecutor tried to discredit her by implying that there was a friendly \nrelationship between her and appellant. However, no concrete proof \nshowing that \nher testimony was biased was ever presented.\n\nGranting for the sake of argument that there was a friendly \nrelationship \nbetween Butay and appellant, it did not impair or in any way affect the \nweight \nof her testimony. We have often held that the relationship of a witness \nwith the \naccused does not automatically affect the veracity of the formerâs \ntestimony. [62] Friendship alone, even if \ntrue, is not reason enough to discredit and label Butayâs testimony as \nbiased \nand unworthy of credence.\n\nEpilogue\n\nGiven\n the foregoing findings, we are not concluding that complainant has not \nbeen a victim of rape, or that appellantâs defense of alibi and denial \ncan be \ngiven full faith and credence. We only stress that her testimony was \nunable to \npass the exacting test of moral certainty that the law demands and the \nrules \nrequire to satisfy the prosecutionâs burden of overcoming appellantâs \npresumption of innocence. [63]\n\nA conviction in a criminal case must be supported by proof \nbeyond reasonable \ndoubt -- moral certainty that the accused is guilty. [64] The defense may be \nweak, but the \nprosecution is even weaker. [65] As a \nresult of this finding, it will be unnecessary to discuss the other \nissues \nraised.\n\nThe Court has aptly said: âIt is better to liberate a guilty \nman than to \nunjustly keep in prison one whose guilt has not been proved by the \nrequired \nquantum of evidence. Hence, despite the Courtâs support of ardent \ncrusaders \nwaging all-out war against felons on the loose, when the Peopleâs \nevidence fails \nto prove indubitably the accusedâs authorship of the crime of which they\n stand \naccused, it is the Courtâs duty -- and the accusedâs right -- to \nproclaim their \ninnocence. Acquittal, therefore, is in order.â [66]\n\nWHEREFORE, the automatically appealed Decision of the Regional \nTrial Court of \nAgoo, La Union in Criminal Case Nos. A-3177, A-3274, A-3275, A-3276 and \nA-3277 \nis SET ASIDE. Consequently, Ernesto Fernandez is ACQUITTED and ordered \nimmediately RELEASED from custody,\n unless he is being held for \nsome other lawful cause.\n\nThe director of the Bureau of Corrections is ORDERED to implement \nthis Decision forthwith and to \nINFORM this Court, within five (5) days from receipt hereof, of the date\n \nappellant was actually released from confinement.
