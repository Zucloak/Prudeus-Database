  "title": "INSULAR LIFE ASSURANCE CO., LTD., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (FOURTH DIVISION, CEBU CITY), LABOR ARBITER NICASIO P. ANINON AND PANTALEON DE LOS REYES, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N BELLOSILLO, J.: On 17 June 1994 respondent Labor Arbiter dismissed for lack of jurisdiction NLRC RAB-VII Case No. 03-0309-94 filed by private respondent Pantaleon de los Reyes against petitioner Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. (INSULAR LIFE), for illegal dismissal and nonpayment of salaries and back wages after findings no employer-employee relationship between De los Reyes and petitioner INSULAR LIFE.[1] On appeal by private respondent, the order of dismissal was reversed by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which ruled that respondent De los Reyes was an employee of petitioner.[2] Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration having been denied, the NLRC remanded the case to the Labor Arbiter for hearing on the merits. Seeking relief through this special civil action for certiorari with prayer for a restraining order and/or preliminary injunction, petitioner now comes to us praying for annulment of the decision of respondent NLRC dated 3 March 1995 and its Order dated 6 April 1995 denying the motion for reconsideration of the decision. It faults NLRC for acting without jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of discretion when, contrary to established facts and pertinent law and jurisprudence, it reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and held instead that the complaint was properly filed as an employer-employee relationship existed between petitioner and private respondent. Petitioner reprises the stand it assumed below that it never had any employer-employee relationship with private respondent, this being an express agreement between them in the agency contracts, particularly reinforced by the stipulation therein de los Reyes was allowed discretion to devise ways and means to fulfill his obligations as agent and would be paid commission fees based on his actual output. It further insists that the nature of this work status as described in the contracts had already been squarely resolved by the Court in the earlier case of Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. NLRC and Basiao [3]where the complainant therein, Melecio Basiao, was similarly situated as respondent De los Reyes in that he was appointed first as an agent and then promoted as agency manager, and the contracts under which he was appointed contained terms and conditions Identical to those of De los Reyes. Petitioner concludes that since Basiao was declared by the Court to be an independent contractor and not an employee of petitioner, there should be no reason why the status of De los Reyes herein vis-Ã -vis petitioner should not be similarly determined. We reject the submissions of petitioner and hold that respondent NLRC acted appropriately within the bounds of the law. The records of the case are replete with telltale indicators of an existing employer-employee relationship between the two parties despite written contractual disavowals. These facts are undisputed: on 21 August 1992 petitioner entered into an agency contract with respondent Pantaleon de los Reyes[4] authorizing the latter to solicit within the Philippines applications for life insurance and annuities for which he would be paid compensation in the form of commissions. The contract was prepared by petitioner in its entirety and De los Reyes merely signed his conformity thereto. It contained the stipulation that no employer-employee relationship shall be created between the parties and that the agent shall be free to exercise his own judgment as to time, place and means of soliciting insurance. De los Reyes however was prohibited by petitioner from working for any other life insurance company, and violation of this stipulation was sufficient ground for termination of the contract. Aside from soliciting insurance for the petitioner, private respondent was required to submit to the former all completed applications for insurance within ninety (90) consecutive days, deliver policies, receive and collect initial premiums and balances of first year premiums, renewal premiums, deposits on applications and payments on policy loans. Private respondent was also bound to turn over to the company immediately any and all sums of money collected by him. In a written communication by petitioner to respondent De los Reyes, the latter was urged to register with the Social Security System as a self-employed individual as provided under PD No. 1636.[5] On 1 March 1993 petitioner and private respondent entered into another contract[6]where the latter was appointed as Acting Unit Manager under its office â the Cebu DSO V (157). As such, the duties and responsibilities of De los Reyes included the recruitment, training, organization and development within his designated territory of a sufficient number of qualified, competent and trustworthy underwriters, and to supervise and coordinate the sales efforts of the underwriters in the active solicitation of new business and in the furtherance of the agencyâs assigned goals. It was similarly provIded in the management contract that the relation of the acting unit manager and/or the agents of his unit to the company shall be that of independent contractor. If the appointment was terminated for any reason other than for cause, the acting unit manager would be reverted to agent status and assigned to any unit. As in the previous agency contract, De los Reyes together with his unit force was granted freedom to exercise judgment as to time, place and means of soliciting insurance. Aside from being granted override commissions, the acting unit manager was given production bonus, development allowance and a unit development financing scheme euphemistically termed âfinancial assistanceâ consisting of payment to him of a free portion of P300.00 per month and a valIdate portion of P1,200.00. While the latter amount was deemed as an advance against expected commissions, the former was not and would be freely given to the unit manager by the company only upon fulfillment by him of certain manpower and premium quota requirements. The agents and underwriters recruited and trained by the acting unit manager would be attached to the unit but petitioner reserved the right to determine if such assignment would be made or, for any reason, to reassign them elsewhere. Aside from soliciting insurance, De los Reyes was also expressly obliged to participate in the companyâs conservation program, i.e., preservation and maintenance of existing insurance policies, and to accept moneys duly receipted on agentâs receipts provided the same were turned over to the company. As long as he was unit manager in an acting capacity, De los Reyes was prohibited from working for other life insurance companies or with the government. He could not also accept a managerial or supervisory position in any firm doing business in the Philippines without the written consent of petitioner. Private respondent worked concurrently as agent and Acting Unit Manager until he was notified by petitioner on 18 November 1993 that his services were terminated effective 18 December 1993. On 7 March 1994 he filed a complaint before the Labor Arbiter on the ground that he was illegally dismissed and that he was not paid his salaries and separation pay. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the complaint of De los Reyes for lack of jurisdiction, citing the absence of employer-employee relationship. it reasoned out that based on the criteria for determining the existence of such relationship or the so-called âfour-fold test,â i.e., (a) selection and engagement of employee, (b) payment of wages, (c) power of dismissal, and, (d) power of control, De los Reyes was not an employee but an independent contractor. On 17 June 1994 the motion of petitioner was granted by the Labor Arbiter and the case was dismissed on the ground that the element of control was not sufficiently established since the rules and guidelines set by petitioner in its agency agreement with respondent De los Reyes were formulated only to achieve the desired result without dictating the means or methods of attaining it. Respondent NLRC however appreciated the evidence from a different perspective. It determined that respondent De los Reyes was under the effective control of petitioner in the critical and most important aspects of his work as Unit Manager. This conclusion was derived from the provisions in the contract which appointed private respondent as Acting Unit Manager, to wit: (a) De los Reyes was to serve exclusively the company, therefore, he was not an independent contractor; (b) he was required to meet certain manpower and production quota; and, (c) petitioner controlled the assignment to and removal of soliciting agents from his unit. The NLRC also took into account other circumstances showing that petitioner exercised employerâs prerogatives over De los Reyes, e.g., (a) limiting the work of respondent De los Reyes to selling a life insurance policy known as âSalary Deduction Insuranceâ only to members of the Philippine National Police, public and private school teachers and other employees of private companies; (b) assigning private respondent to a particular place and table where he worked whenever he has not in the field; (c) paying private respondent during the period of twelve (12) months of his appointment as Acting Unit Manager the amount of P1,500.00 as Unit Development Financing of which 20% formed his salary and the rest, i.e., 80%, as advance of his expected commissions; and (d) promising that upon completion of certain requirements, he would be promoted to Unit Manager with the right of petitioner to revert him to agent status when warranted. Parenthetically, both petitioner and respondent NLRC treated the agency contract and the management contract entered into between petitioner and De los Reyes as contracts of agency. We however hold otherwise. Unquestionably there exist major distinctions between the two agreements. While the first has the earmarks of an agency contract, the second is far removed from the concept of agency in that provided therein are conditionalities that indicate an employer-employee relationship. the NLRC therefore was correct in finding that private respondent was an employee of petitioner, but this holds true only insofar as the management contract is concerned. In view thereof, he Labor Arbiter has jurisdiction over the case. It is axiomatic that the existence of an employer-employee relationship cannot be negated by expressly repudiating it in the management contract and providing therein that the âemployeeâ is an independent contractor when the terms of agreement clearly show otherwise. For, the employment status of a person is defined and prescribed by law and not by what the parties say it should be.[7] In determining the status of the management contract, the âfour-fold testâ on employment earlier mentioned has to be applied. Petitioner contends that De los Reyes was never required to go through the pre-employment procedures and that the probationary employment status was reserved only to employees of petitioner. On this score, it insists that the first requirement of selection and engagement of the employee was not met. A look at the provisions of the contract shows that private respondent was appointed as Acting Unit Manager only upon recommendation of the District Manager.[8] This indicates that private respondent was hired by petitioner because of the favorable endorsement of its duly authorized officer. But, this approbation could only have been based on the performance of De los Reyes with petitioner was nothing more than a trial or probationary period for his eventual appointment as Acting Unit Manager of petitioner. Then, again, the very designation of the appointment of private respondent as âactingâ unit manager obviously implies a temporary employment status which may be made permanent only upon compliance with company standards such as those enumerated under Sec. 6 of the management contract.[9] On the matter of payment of wages, petitioner points out that respondent was compensated strictly on commission basis, the amount of which was totally dependent on his total output. But, the managerâs contract speaks differently. Thus â 4. Performance Requirements.- To maintain your appointment as Acting Unit Manager you must meet the following manpower and production requirements: Quarter Active Calendar Year Production Agents Cumulative FYP Production 1ST 2 P125,000 2ND 3 250,000 3RD 4 375,000 4TH 5 500,000 5.4 Unit Development Financing (UDF). â As an Acting Unit Manager you shall be given during the first 12 months of your appointment a financial assistance which is composed of two parts: 5.4.1 Free Portion amounting to P300 per month, subject to your meeting prescribed minimum performance requirement on manpower and premium production. The free portion is not payable by you. 5.4.2 Validate Portion amounting to P1,200 per month, also subject to meeting the same prescribed minimum performance requirements on manpower and premium production. The valIdated portion is an advance against expected compensation during the UDF period and thereafter as may be necessary. The above provisions unquestionably demonstrate that the performance requirement imposed on De los Reyes was applicable quarterly while his entitlement to the free portion (P300) and the validated portion (P1,200) was monthly starting on the first month of the twelve (12) months of the appointment. Thus, it has to be admitted that even before the end of the first quarter and prior to the so-called quarterly performance evaluation, private respondent was already entitled to be paid both the free and validated portions of the UDF every month because his production performance could not be determined until after the lapse of the quarter involved. This indicates quite clearly that the unit managerâs quarterly performance had no bearing at all on his entitlement at least to the free portion of the UDF which for all intents and purposes comprised the salary regularly paid to him by petitioner. Thus it cannot be validly claimed that the financial assistance consisting of the free portion of the UDF was purely dependent on the premium production of the agent. Be that as it may, it is worth considering that the payment of compensation by way of commission does not militate against the conclusion that private respondent was an employee of petitioner. Under Art. 97 of the Labor Code, âwageâ shall mean âhowever designated, capable of being expressed in terms of money, whether fixed or ascertained on a time, task, price or commission basis x x x xâ [10] As to the matter involving the power of dismissal and control by the employer, the latter of which is the most important of the test, petitioner asserts that its termination of De los Reyes was but an exercise of its inherent right as principal under the contracts and that the rules and guIdelines it set forth in the contract cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be deemed as an exercise of control over the private respondent as these were merely directives that fixed the desired result without dictating the means or method to be employed in attaining it. The following factual findings of the NLRC[11] however contradict such claims: A perusal of the appointment of complainant as Acting Unit Manager reveals that: 1. Complainant was to âexclusivelyâ serve respondent company. Thus it is provIded: x x x 7..7 Other causes of Termination: This Appointment may likewise be terminated for any of the following causes: x x x 7..7..2. Your entering the service of the government or another life insurance company; 7..7..3. Your accepting a managerial or supervisory position in any firm doing business in the Philippines without the written consent of the Company; x x x 2. Complainant was required to meet certain manpower and production quotas. 3. Respondent (herein petitioner) controlled the assignment and removal of soliciting agents to and from complainantâs unit, thus: x x x 7..2. Assignment of Agents: Agents recruited and trained by you shall be attached to your unit unless for reasons of Company policy, no such assignment should be made. The Company retains the exclusive right to assign new soliciting agents appointed and assigned to the saId unit x x x x It would not be amiss to state the respondentâs duty to collect the companyâs premiums using company receipts under Sec. 7.4 of the management contract is further evIdence of petitionerâs control over respondent, thus: xxxx 7.4 Acceptance and Remittance of Premiums. â x x x x the Company hereby authorizes you to accept and receive sums of money in payment of premiums, loans, deposits on applications, with or without interest, due from policy holders and applicants for insurance, and the like, specially from policyholders of business solicited and sold by the agents attached to your unit provIded however, that all such payments shall be duly receipted by you on the corresponding Companyâs âAgentsâ Receiptâ to be provIded you for this purpose and to be covered by such rules and accounting regulations the Company may issue from time to time on the matter. Payments received by you shall be turned over to the Companyâs designated District or Service Office clerk or directly to the Home Office not later than the next working day from receipt thereof x x x x Petitioner would have us apply our ruling in Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. NLRC and Basiao [12] to the instant case under the doctrine of stare decisis, postulating that both cases involve parties similarly situated and facts which are almost Identical. But we are not convinced that the cited case is on all fours with the case at bar. In Basiao, the agent was appointed Agency Manager under an Agency Manager Contract. To implement his end of the agreement, Melecio Basiao organized an agency office to which he gave the name M. Basiao and Associates. The Agency Manager Contract practically contained the same terms and conditions as the Agency Contract earlier entered into, and the Court observed that âdrawn from the terms of the contract they had entered into, (which) either expressly or by necessary implication, Basiao (was) made the master of his own time and selling methods, left to his own judgment the time, place and means of soliciting insurance, set no accomplishment quotas and compensated him on the bases of results obtained. He was not bound to observe any schedule of working hours or report to any regular station; he could seek and work on his prospects anywhere and anytime he chose to and was free to adopt the selling methods he deemed most effective.â Upon these premises, Basiao was considered as agent â an independent contractor â of petitioner INSULAR LIFE. Unlike Basiao, herein respondent De los Reyes was appointed Acting Unit Manager, not agency manager. There is not evidence that to implement his obligations under the management contract, De los Reyes had organized an office. Petitioner in fact has admitted that it provIded De los Reyes a place and a table at its office where he reported for and worked whenever he was not out in the field. Placed under petitionerâs Cebu District Service Office, the unit was given a name by petitioner â De los Reyes and Associates â and assigned Code No. 11753 and Recruitment No. 109398. Under the managership contract, De los Reyes was obliged to work exclusively for petitioner in life insurance solicitation and was imposed premium production quotas. Of course, the acting unit manager could not underwrite other lines of insurance because his Permanent Certificate of Authority was for life insurance only and for no other. He was proscribed from accepting a managerial or supervisory position in any other office including the government without the written consent of petitioner. De los Reyes could only be promoted to permanent unit manager if he met certain requirements and his promotion was recommended by the petitionerâs District Manager and Regional Manager and approved by its Division Manager. As Acting Unit Manager, De los Reyes performed functions beyond mere solicitation of insurance business for petitioner. As found by the NLRC, he exercised administrative functions which were necessary and beneficial to the business of INSULAR LIFE. In Great Pacific Life Insurance Company v. NLRC[13] which is closer in application that Basiao to this present controversy, we found that âthe relationships of the Ruiz brothers and Grepalife were those of employer-employee. First, their work at the time of their dismissal as zone supervisor and district manager was necessary and desirable to the usual business of the insurance company. They were entrusted with supervisory, sales and other functions to guard Grepalifeâs business interests and to bring in more clients to the company, and even with administrative functions to ensure that all collections, reports and data are faithfully brought to the company x x x x A cursory reading of their respective functions as enumerated in their contracts reveals that the company practically dictates the manner by which their jobs are to be carried out x x x xâ We need elaborate no further. Exclusivity of service, control of assignments and removal of agents under private respondentâs unit, collection of premiums, furnishing of company facilities and materials as well as capital described as Unit Development Fund are but hallmarks of the management system in which herein private respondent worked. This obtaining, there is no escaping the conclusion that private respondent Pantaleon de los Reyes was an employee of herein petitioner. WHEREFORE, the petition of Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd., is DENIED and the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission dated 3 March 1995 and its Order of 6 April 1996 sustaining it are AFFIRMED. Let this case be REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter a quo who is directed to hear and dispose of this case with deliberate dispatch in light of the views expressed herein. SO ORDERED.

Petitioner concludes that since Basiao was declared\nby the Court to be an independent contractor and not an employee of petitioner,\nthere should be no reason why the status of De los Reyes herein vis-Ã -vis petitioner should not be similarly determined.\n\nWe reject the\nsubmissions of petitioner and hold that respondent NLRC acted appropriately\nwithin the bounds of the law. The records of the case are replete with telltale\nindicators of an existing employer-employee relationship between the two\nparties despite written contractual disavowals.\n\nThese facts are\nundisputed: on 21 August 1992 petitioner entered into an agency contract with\nrespondent Pantaleon de los Reyes [4] authorizing the latter to solicit\nwithin the Philippines applications for life insurance and annuities for which\nhe would be paid compensation in the form of commissions. The contract was\nprepared by petitioner in its entirety and De los Reyes merely signed his\nconformity thereto. It contained the stipulation that no employer-employee\nrelationship shall be created between the parties and that the agent shall be\nfree to exercise his own judgment as to time, place and means of soliciting\ninsurance. De los Reyes however was prohibited by petitioner from working for\nany other life insurance company, and violation of this stipulation was\nsufficient ground for termination of the contract. Aside from soliciting\ninsurance for the petitioner, private respondent was required to submit to the\nformer all completed applications for insurance within ninety (90) consecutive\ndays, deliver policies, receive and collect initial premiums and balances of\nfirst year premiums, renewal premiums, deposits on applications and payments on\npolicy loans. Private respondent was also bound to turn over to the company\nimmediately any and all sums of money collected by him. In a written\ncommunication by petitioner to respondent De los Reyes, the latter was urged to\nregister with the Social Security System as a self-employed individual as provided under PD No. 1636. [5]\n\nOn 1 March 1993\npetitioner and private respondent entered into another contract [6] where the latter was appointed as\nActing Unit Manager under its office â the Cebu DSO V (157). As such, the\nduties and responsibilities of De los Reyes included the recruitment, training,\norganization and development within his designated territory of a sufficient\nnumber of qualified, competent and trustworthy underwriters, and to supervise\nand coordinate the sales efforts of the underwriters in the active solicitation\nof new business and in the furtherance of the agencyâs assigned goals. It was\nsimilarly provIded in the management contract that the relation of the acting\nunit manager and/or the agents of his unit to the company shall be that of\nindependent contractor. If the appointment was terminated for any reason other\nthan for cause, the acting unit manager would be reverted to agent status and\nassigned to any unit. As in the previous agency contract, De los Reyes together\nwith his unit force was granted freedom to exercise judgment as to time, place\nand means of soliciting insurance. Aside from being granted override\ncommissions, the acting unit manager was given production bonus, development\nallowance and a unit development financing scheme euphemistically termed\nâfinancial assistanceâ consisting of payment to him of a free portion of P 300.00\nper month and a valIdate portion of P 1,200.00. While the latter amount\nwas deemed as an advance against expected commissions, the former was not and\nwould be freely given to the unit manager by the company only upon fulfillment\nby him of certain manpower and premium quota requirements. The agents\nand underwriters recruited and trained by the acting unit manager would be\nattached to the unit but petitioner reserved the right to determine if such\nassignment would be made or, for any reason, to reassign them elsewhere.\n\nAside from\nsoliciting insurance, De los Reyes was also expressly obliged to participate in\nthe companyâs conservation program, i.e., preservation and maintenance of\nexisting insurance policies, and to accept moneys duly receipted on agentâs\nreceipts provided the same were turned over to the company. As long as he was\nunit manager in an acting capacity, De los Reyes was prohibited from working\nfor other life insurance companies or with the government. He could not also\naccept a managerial or supervisory position in any firm doing business in the\nPhilippines without the written consent of petitioner.\n\nPrivate\nrespondent worked concurrently as agent and Acting Unit Manager until he was\nnotified by petitioner on 18 November 1993 that his services were terminated\neffective 18 December 1993. On 7 March 1994 he filed a complaint before the\nLabor Arbiter on the ground that he was illegally dismissed and that he was not\npaid his salaries and separation pay.\n\nPetitioner filed\na motion to dismiss the complaint of De los Reyes for lack of jurisdiction,\nciting the absence of employer-employee relationship. it reasoned out that\nbased on the criteria for determining the existence of such relationship or the\nso-called âfour-fold test,â i.e., (a) selection and engagement of employee, (b)\npayment of wages, (c) power of dismissal, and, (d) power of control, De los\nReyes was not an employee but an independent contractor.\n\nOn 17 June 1994\nthe motion of petitioner was granted by the Labor Arbiter and the case was\ndismissed on the ground that the element of control was not sufficiently\nestablished since the rules and guidelines set by petitioner in its agency\nagreement with respondent De los Reyes were formulated only to achieve the\ndesired result without dictating the means or methods of attaining it.\n\nRespondent NLRC\nhowever appreciated the evidence from a different perspective. It determined\nthat respondent De los Reyes was under the effective control of petitioner\nin the critical and most important aspects of his work as Unit Manager .\nThis conclusion was derived from the provisions in the contract which appointed\nprivate respondent as Acting Unit Manager, to wit: (a) De los Reyes was to\nserve exclusively the company, therefore, he was not an independent contractor;\n(b) he was required to meet certain manpower and production quota ; and,\n(c) petitioner controlled the assignment to and removal of soliciting agents\nfrom his unit.\n\nThe NLRC also\ntook into account other circumstances showing that petitioner exercised\nemployerâs prerogatives over De los Reyes, e.g., (a) limiting the work of\nrespondent De los Reyes to selling a life insurance policy known as âSalary\nDeduction Insuranceâ only to members of the Philippine National Police,\npublic and private school teachers and other employees of private companies;\n(b) assigning private respondent to a particular place and table where he\nworked whenever he has not in the field; (c) paying private respondent during\nthe period of twelve (12) months of his appointment as Acting Unit Manager the\namount of P 1,500.00 as Unit Development Financing of which 20% formed\nhis salary and the rest, i.e., 80%, as advance of his expected commissions; and\n(d) promising that upon completion of certain requirements, he would be\npromoted to Unit Manager with the right of petitioner to revert him to agent\nstatus when warranted.\n\nParenthetically,\nboth petitioner and respondent NLRC treated the agency contract and the\nmanagement contract entered into between petitioner and De los Reyes as\ncontracts of agency. We however hold otherwise. Unquestionably there exist\nmajor distinctions between the two agreements. While the first has the earmarks\nof an agency contract, the second is far removed from the concept of agency in\nthat provided therein are conditionalities that indicate an employer-employee\nrelationship. the NLRC therefore was correct in finding that private respondent\nwas an employee of petitioner, but this holds true only insofar as the\nmanagement contract is concerned. In view thereof, he Labor Arbiter has\njurisdiction over the case.\n\nIt is axiomatic\nthat the existence of an employer-employee relationship cannot be negated by\nexpressly repudiating it in the management contract and providing therein that\nthe âemployeeâ is an independent contractor when the terms of agreement clearly\nshow otherwise. For, the employment status of a person is defined and\nprescribed by law and not by what the parties say it should be. [7] In determining the status of the\nmanagement contract, the âfour-fold testâ on employment earlier mentioned has\nto be applied.\n\nPetitioner\ncontends that De los Reyes was never required to go through the pre-employment\nprocedures and that the probationary employment status was reserved only to\nemployees of petitioner. On this score, it insists that the first requirement\nof selection and engagement of the employee was not met.\n\nA look at the\nprovisions of the contract shows that private respondent was appointed as\nActing Unit Manager only upon recommendation of the District Manager. [8] This indicates that private\nrespondent was hired by petitioner because of the favorable endorsement of its\nduly authorized officer. But, this approbation could only have been based on\nthe performance of De los Reyes with petitioner was nothing more than a trial\nor probationary period for his eventual appointment as Acting Unit Manager of\npetitioner. Then, again, the very designation of the appointment of private\nrespondent as âactingâ unit manager obviously implies a temporary employment\nstatus which may be made permanent only upon compliance with company standards\nsuch as those enumerated under Sec. 6 of the management contract. [9]\n\nOn the matter of\npayment of wages, petitioner points out that respondent was compensated\nstrictly on commission basis, the amount of which was totally dependent on his\ntotal output. But, the managerâs contract speaks differently. Thus â 4. Performance\nRequirements. - To maintain your appointment as Acting Unit Manager you must\nmeet the following manpower and production requirements:\n\nQuarter Active Calendar Year\n\nProduction Agents Cumulative\nFYP\n\nProduction\n\n1 ST 2 P 125,000\n\n2 ND 3 250,000\n\n3 RD 4 375,000\n\n4 TH 5 500,000 5.4 Unit Development Financing (UDF). â As an Acting\nUnit Manager you shall be given during the first 12 months of your appointment\na financial assistance which is composed of two parts:\n\n5.4.1 Free\nPortion amounting to P 300 per month, subject to your meeting prescribed\nminimum performance requirement on manpower and premium production. The free\nportion is not payable by you.\n\n5.4.2 Validate\nPortion amounting to P 1,200 per month, also subject to meeting the same\nprescribed minimum performance requirements on manpower and premium production.\nThe valIdated portion is an advance against expected compensation during the\nUDF period and thereafter as may be necessary.\n\nThe above\nprovisions unquestionably demonstrate that the performance requirement imposed\non De los Reyes was applicable quarterly while his entitlement to the\nfree portion ( P 300) and the validated portion ( P 1,200) was monthly starting on the first month of the twelve (12) months of the appointment. Thus,\nit has to be admitted that even before the end of the first quarter and prior\nto the so-called quarterly performance evaluation, private respondent was\nalready entitled to be paid both the free and validated portions of the UDF\nevery month because his production performance could not be determined until\nafter the lapse of the quarter involved. This indicates quite clearly that the\nunit managerâs quarterly performance had no bearing at all on his entitlement\nat least to the free portion of the UDF which for all intents and purposes\ncomprised the salary regularly paid to him by petitioner. Thus it cannot be\nvalidly claimed that the financial assistance consisting of the free portion of\nthe UDF was purely dependent on the premium production of the agent. Be that as\nit may, it is worth considering that the payment of compensation by way of\ncommission does not militate against the conclusion that private respondent was\nan employee of petitioner. Under Art. 97 of the Labor Code, âwageâ shall mean\nâhowever designated, capable of being expressed in terms of money, whether\nfixed or ascertained on a time, task, price or commission basis x x x xâ [10]\n\nAs to the matter\ninvolving the power of dismissal and control by the employer, the latter of\nwhich is the most important of the test, petitioner asserts that its\ntermination of De los Reyes was but an exercise of its inherent right as\nprincipal under the contracts and that the rules and guIdelines it set forth in\nthe contract cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be deemed as an exercise of\ncontrol over the private respondent as these were merely directives that fixed\nthe desired result without dictating the means or method to be employed in\nattaining it. The following factual findings of the NLRC [11] however contradict such claims: A perusal of the appointment of\ncomplainant as Acting Unit Manager reveals that:\n\n1. Complainant\nwas to âexclusivelyâ serve respondent company. Thus it is provIded: x x x 7..7\nOther causes of Termination: This Appointment may likewise be terminated for\nany of the following causes: x x x 7..7..2.

Complainant\nwas required to meet certain manpower and production quotas .\n\n3. Respondent\n(herein petitioner) controlled the assignment and removal of soliciting agents\nto and from complainantâs unit, thus: x x x 7..2. Assignment of Agents: Agents\nrecruited and trained by you shall be attached to your unit unless for reasons of\nCompany policy, no such assignment should be made. The Company retains the\nexclusive right to assign new soliciting agents appointed and assigned to the\nsaId unit x x x x\n\nIt would not be\namiss to state the respondentâs duty to collect the companyâs premiums using\ncompany receipts under Sec. 7.4 of the management contract is further evIdence\nof petitionerâs control over respondent, thus:\n\nxxxx 7.4 Acceptance and Remittance of\nPremiums . â x x x x the Company hereby authorizes you to accept and receive\nsums of money in payment of premiums, loans, deposits on applications, with or\nwithout interest, due from policy holders and applicants for insurance, and the\nlike, specially from policyholders of business solicited and sold by the agents\nattached to your unit provIded however, that all such payments shall be duly\nreceipted by you on the corresponding Companyâs âAgentsâ Receiptâ to be\nprovIded you for this purpose and to be covered by such rules and accounting\nregulations the Company may issue from time to time on the matter. Payments\nreceived by you shall be turned over to the Companyâs designated District or\nService Office clerk or directly to the Home Office not later than the next\nworking day from receipt thereof x x x x\n\nPetitioner would\nhave us apply our ruling in Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. NLRC and\nBasiao [12] to the instant case under the\ndoctrine of stare decisis , postulating that both cases involve parties\nsimilarly situated and facts which are almost Identical.\n\nBut we are not\nconvinced that the cited case is on all fours with the case at bar. In Basiao ,\nthe agent was appointed Agency Manager under an Agency Manager Contract. To\nimplement his end of the agreement, Melecio Basiao organized an agency office\nto which he gave the name M. Basiao and Associates. The Agency Manager\nContract practically contained the same terms and conditions as the Agency\nContract earlier entered into, and the Court observed that âdrawn from the\nterms of the contract they had entered into, (which) either expressly or by\nnecessary implication, Basiao (was) made the master of his own time and selling\nmethods, left to his own judgment the time, place and means of soliciting\ninsurance, set no accomplishment quotas and compensated him on the bases\nof results obtained. He was not bound to observe any schedule of working hours\nor report to any regular station; he could seek and work on his prospects\nanywhere and anytime he chose to and was free to adopt the selling methods he\ndeemed most effective.â Upon these premises, Basiao was considered as agent â\nan independent contractor â of petitioner INSULAR LIFE.\n\nUnlike Basiao,\nherein respondent De los Reyes was appointed Acting Unit Manager , not\nagency manager. There is not evidence that to implement his obligations under\nthe management contract, De los Reyes had organized an office. Petitioner in\nfact has admitted that it provIded De los Reyes a place and a table at its\noffice where he reported for and worked whenever he was not out in the field.\nPlaced under petitionerâs Cebu District Service Office, the unit was given a\nname by petitioner â De los Reyes and Associates â and assigned Code No. 11753\nand Recruitment No. 109398. Under the managership contract, De los Reyes was\nobliged to work exclusively for petitioner in life insurance solicitation and\nwas imposed premium production quotas . Of course, the acting unit\nmanager could not underwrite other lines of insurance because his Permanent\nCertificate of Authority was for life insurance only and for no other. He was proscribed\nfrom accepting a managerial or supervisory position in any other office\nincluding the government without the written consent of petitioner. De los\nReyes could only be promoted to permanent unit manager if he met certain\nrequirements and his promotion was recommended by the petitionerâs District\nManager and Regional Manager and approved by its Division Manager. As Acting\nUnit Manager, De los Reyes performed functions beyond mere solicitation of\ninsurance business for petitioner. As found by the NLRC, he exercised\nadministrative functions which were necessary and beneficial to the business of\nINSULAR LIFE.\n\nIn Great\nPacific Life Insurance Company v. NLRC [13] which is closer in application that Basiao to\nthis present controversy, we found that âthe relationships of the Ruiz brothers\nand Grepalife were those of employer-employee. First, their work at the time of\ntheir dismissal as zone supervisor and district manager was necessary and\ndesirable to the usual business of the insurance company. They were entrusted\nwith supervisory, sales and other functions to guard Grepalifeâs business\ninterests and to bring in more clients to the company, and even with\nadministrative functions to ensure that all collections, reports and data are\nfaithfully brought to the company x x x x A cursory reading of their respective\nfunctions as enumerated in their contracts reveals that the company practically\ndictates the manner by which their jobs are to be carried out x x x xâ We need\nelaborate no further.\n\nExclusivity of\nservice, control of assignments and removal of agents under private\nrespondentâs unit, collection of premiums, furnishing of company facilities and\nmaterials as well as capital described as Unit Development Fund are but\nhallmarks of the management system in which herein private respondent worked.\nThis obtaining, there is no escaping the conclusion that private respondent\nPantaleon de los Reyes was an employee of herein petitioner.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition of Insular Life\nAssurance Company, Ltd., is DENIED and the Decision of the National Labor\nRelations Commission dated 3 March 1995 and its Order of 6 April 1996\nsustaining it are AFFIRMED. Let this case be REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter a\nquo who is directed to hear and dispose of this case with deliberate\ndispatch in light of the views expressed herein.\n\nSO ORDERED.
