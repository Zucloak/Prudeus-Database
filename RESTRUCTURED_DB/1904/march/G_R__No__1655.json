No. 1655            March 29, 1904\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\ncomplainant-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nLEON DE LA TORRE,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nClaro Reyes for appellant.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.\n\nWILLARD,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe defendant in this case admitted his guilt, and the only question is as to the penalty. The court below took into consideration the aggravating circumstances numbered seven, nine, and twenty, and sentenced the defendant to death, the higher of the two indivisible penalties  life imprisonment and death  assigned to the crime of parricide by the Penal Code.\n\nWe do not think that there was sufficient evidence to prove the seventh circumstance  known premeditation. If the defendant went to the house where his wife was for the purpose of killing her, it is not apparent why they traveled for an hour after leaving the house before he attacked her. Moreover, as suggested by the defendant's counsel in his brief, the defendant would not have struck one blow only and have gone away, leaving his wife still alive, not knowing whether the blow was mortal or not, if he had entertained the fixed determination of putting an end to her existence. She did not, in fact die until the next day. The account given by the defendant in the Court of First Instance is probably the truth. He says that his wife not wish to go to the mountains, and quarreled with him all the way, until, in a fit of rage, he drew his bolo and struck her in the abdomen.\n\nThe circumstance of sex (No. 20) is included in the crime itself in this particular case. The only thing which makes this offense parricide is the fact that the deceased was the wife of the defendant. To allow it as an aggravating circumstance would be to give it double effect.\n\nThe same is true of the abuse of superiority (No. 9). That existed, if at all, by reason of the same fact, viz., that one person was a woman and the other a man. Neither of these circumstances should be taken into account.\n\nIt is not necessary to consider whether the seventh extenuating circumstance existed or not. There were, in any event, no others, and in this crime one extenuating circumstance can not effect the penalty.\n\nThe judgment is reversed, and the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment, with the accessories and the costs.\n\nArellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa and McDonough, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nSeparate Opinions\n\nJOHNSON,\n\nJ.,\n\ndissenting:\n\nIt is my opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
