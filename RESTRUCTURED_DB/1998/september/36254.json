Nos. 108725-26, September 25, 1998 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND FARMERS COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION (FACOMA), SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. EMILIO L. LEACHON, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE, RTC, BRANCH 46, 4TH JUDICIAL REGION, SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND FARMERS COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION (FACOMA), SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. EMILIO L. LEACHON, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE, RTC, BRANCH 46, 4TH JUDICIAL REGION, SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPURISIMA, J.:\n\nThe People of the Philippines,\nrepresented by the Provincial Prosecutor of Occidental Mindoro, and the private\ncomplainant, Farmersâ Cooperative Marketing Association (FACOMA), brought this\nspecial civil action for certiorari and mandamus, to annul the orders,\ndated January 18 and February 4, 1993, respectively, of Presiding Judge Emilio\nL. Leachon, Jr. of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 46, San Jose, Occidental\nMindoro, who dismissed Criminal Case Nos. R-2877 and R-2828, and denied herein\npetitionersâ motion for reconsideration. Petitioners further pray that respondent Judge be ordered to proceed with\nthe trial of said cases.\n\nThe antecedent facts that matter\nare, as follows: On August 7, 1990, pursuant to the Resolution of the Municipal\nTrial Court of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, the Provincial Prosecutor of\nOccidental Mindoro filed two separate informations for violation of P. D. 772,\notherwise known as the Anti-Squatting Law, against Noli Hablo, Edmundo Mapindan\nand Diego Escala, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. R-2877 and R-2828, before the\nRegional Trial Court of Occidental Mindoro presided over by respondent judge. The cases proceeded to trial. After presenting its evidence, the prosecution rested the cases, sending\nin a written offer of evidence on November 14, 1991. On August 18, 1992, almost a year after the prosecution had rested,\nthe respondent Judge issued an Order\ndismissing the said cases motu\nproprio on the ground of âlack of jurisdiction.â From the aforesaid order of dismissal, petitioners appealed to this\nCourt via a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus, which was referred\nto the Court of Appeals for proper disposition.\n\nOn December 24, 1992, the 12th\nDivision of the Court of Appeals came out with a decision reversing the\nappealed Order of dismissal, ordering continuation of trial of subject criminal\ncases, and disposing, thus: âIN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING considerations, the petition\nis given due course and the orders of respondent judge dated August 19, 1992\nand September 1, 1992 are set aside and declared null and void. Respondent\njudge is hereby directed to proceed with the hearing of the case, i.e., with\nthe presentation of evidence by the accused, then the rebuttal or surrebuttal\nevidence, if necessary and thereafter, to decide the case on the basis of the\nevidence adduced. No pronouncement as\nto costs. SO ORDERED.â\n\nOn January 19, 1993, instead of\nconducting the trial, as directed by the Court of Appeals, the respondent judge\ndismissed the cases motu proprio, once more, opining that P.D.\n772 is rendered obsolete and deemed repealed by Sections 9 and 10, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution, which provide that âurban or rural poor\ndwellers shall not be evicted nor their dwellings demolished except in\naccordance with law and in a just and humane manner.â\n\nPetitionersâ Motion for\nReconsideration interposed on January 29, 1993, having been denied by the\nrespondent Judge on February 4, 1993, petitioners found their way to this court via the instant petition.\n\nThe issue posited here is whether\nor not the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack\nor excess of jurisdiction in dismissing subject criminal cases for violation of\nthe Anti-Squatting Law, and in declaring the said law as repugnant to the\nprovisions of the 1987 Constitution.\n\nTo begin with, to every\nlegislative act attaches the presumption of constitutionality. (Misolas vs.Panga, 181 SCRA 648; Alvarez vs.\nGuingona, Jr., 252 SCRA 695). Unless\notherwise repealed by a subsequent law or adjudged unconstitutional by this\nCourt, a law will always be presumed valid and the first and fundamental duty\nof the court is to apply the law. (Lim\nvs. Pacquing, 240 SCRA 649; National Federation of Labor vs. Eisma, 127 SCRA\n419)\n\nThen, too, it is a basic rule of\nstatutory construction that repeals by implication are not favored unless it is\nmanifest that such is the legislative intent. (Napocor vs. Province of Lanao del Sur, 264 SCRA 271) This doctrine is\npremised on the rationale that the will of the legislature cannot be overturned\nby the judicial function of construction and interpretation. (Ty vs. Trampe,\n250 SCRA 500; Frivaldo vs. Comelec, 257 SCRA 727; Agujetas vs. Court of\nAppeals, 261 SCRA 17)\n\nPresidential Decree No. 772,\notherwise known as the Anti-Squatting Law, enjoys this presumption of\nconstitutionality. At the time the\nrespondent Judge rendered the questioned Decision and issued the orders of\ndismissal in 1993, Presidential Decree No. 772, Anti-Squatting Law, was still\neffective. Neither has this Court\ndeclared its unconstitutionality, notwithstanding the social justice provision\nof Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution, specifically on urban land reform and\nhousing.\n\nArticle XIII of the 1987\nConstitution, provides: âSection 9. The State shall, by law, and for the common\ngood, undertake, in cooperation with the private sector, a continuing program\nof urban land reform and housing which will make available at affordable cost\ndecent housing and basic services to underprivileged and homeless citizens in\nurban centers and resettlement areas. It shall also promote adequate employment opportunities to such\ncitizens. In the implementation of such\nprogram the State shall respect the rights of small property owners.â âSec. 10. Urban or rural poor dwellers shall not be evicted\nnor their dwellings demolished, except in accordance with law and in a just and\nhumane manner. No resettlement of urban or rural dwellers shall be\nundertaken without adequate consultation with them and the communities where\nthey are to be relocated.\"\n\nPresidential Decree No. 772, on\nthe other hand, states: âSec. 1. Any person, with the use of force, intimidation or\nthreat, or taking advantage of the absence or tolerance of the landowner,\nsucceeds in occupying or possessing the property of the latter against his will\nfor residential, commercial or any other purposes, shall be punished by\nimprisonment ranging from six months to one year or a fine not less than one thousand or more than five thousand pesos at the discretion of the\nCourt, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. If the offender is a corporation or association, the\nmaximum penalty of five years and the fine of thousand pesos shall be imposed\nupon the president, director, manager or managing partners thereof.â\n\nIn dismissing subject criminal\ncases for anti-squatting, respondent Judge ratiocinated that âif all the\naccused in these cases were convicted and ordered evicted, it will run counter\nto the said specific constitutional provisions because the conviction and\neviction will not be in a just and humane manner as the government has not yet\nundertaken the resettlement of urban and rural dwellers (referring to all\naccused in the cases at bar) and neither has the government consulted all the\naccused as to where they should be relocated.â\n\nFrom the aforequoted portion of the\nquestioned disposition below, it can be gleaned that the reason of respondent Judge in dismissing subject cases\nis that the eviction of the accused was not effected in a just and humane\nmanner as the government has not yet established a resettlement area for the\naccused, and those who would be evicted have not been consulted as to the place\nof their relocation. The import of the\nOrder of dismissal under scrutiny is that- should the eviction be in a just and\nhumane manner, the same shall be valid and upheld.\n\nThe Court holds that the\nrespondent judge did not err in so construing the aforecited constitutional\nprovision. Under the Constitution, what\nmakes the eviction and demolition of urban or rural poor dwellers illegal or\nunlawful is when the same are not done in accordance with law and in a just and\nhumane manner.\n\nHowever, respondent Judge erred in\npredicating the validity or legality of eviction on the existence of a\nresettlement plan and area. The\nconstitutional requirement that the eviction and demolition be in accordance\nwith law and conducted in a just and humane manner does not mean that the\nvalidity or legality of the demolition or eviction is hinged on the existence\nof a resettlement area designated or earmarked by the government. What is meant by âin accordance with lawâ\nand âjust and humane mannerâ is that the person to be evicted be accorded due\nprocess or an opportunity to controvert the allegation that his or her\noccupation or possession of the property involved is unlawful or against the will of the landowner; that should the\nillegal or unlawful occupation be proven, the occupant be sufficiently notified\nbefore actual eviction or demolition is done; and that there be no loss of\nlives, physical injuries or unnecessary loss of or damage to properties.\n\nPrecisely, the enactment of an\nanti-squatting law affords the alleged âsquattersâ the opportunity to present\ntheir case before a competent court where their rights will be amply protected\nand due process strictly observed. By\nfiling the proper informations in court, complainants have complied with the\nfirst requirement of due process, that is, the opportunity for the accused to\nbe heard and present evidence to show that his or her occupation or possession\nof the property is not against the will or without the consent of the landowner\nand is not tainted by the use of force, intimidation, threat or by the taking\nadvantage of the absence of or tolerance by the landowners.\n\nFurthermore, what gives impetus to\nP. D. 772 is the constitutional mandate that - âno person shall be deprived of\nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.â Far from contravening, P. D. 772 conforms with the 1987\nConstitution, in that it protects the\nrights of a property owner against unlawful and illegal intrusion.\n\nIt should likewise be noted that a\nconstitutional question will not be decided unless it is properly raised in\nappropriate cases (Tropical Homes Inc. vs. National Housing Authority, 142 SCRA\n540). Before the court can assume\njurisdiction over a constitutional question, the following requisites must\nfirst be met: (1) there must be an\nactual case or controversy, including a conflict of rights susceptible of\njudicial determination; (2) the constitutional question must be raised by a\nproper party; (3) the constitutional question must be raised at the earliest\nopportunity; and (4) the resolution of the constitutional question must be\nnecessary for the resolution of the\ncase. (Board of Optometry vs Colet, 260\nSCRA 88)\n\nIn the case at bar, the respondent\nJudge dismissed subject cases motu proprio , after the prosecution had\nrested the same and without giving the three accused an opportunity to present\ntheir evidence. What is more, there is\nno showing that the issue of constitutionality of P. D. 772 was ever posed by\nthe accused. Consequently, such an issue cannot be given due course for the\nsimple reason that it was not raised by the proper party at the earliest\nopportunity.\n\nBut the foregoing antecedent facts\nand proceedings notwithstanding, the petition cannot now prosper because on\nOctober 27, 1997, Republic Act No. 8368, entitled âAn Act Repealing\nPresidential Decree No. 772 Entitled âPenalizing Squatting and Other Similar\nActsââ was enacted. Section 3 of the\nsaid Act provides that âall pending cases under the provisions of Presidential\nDecree No. 772 shall be dismissed upon the effectivity of this Act.â\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby DISMISSED, without any\npronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nNarvasa, C.J., ( Chairman ), Romero, and Kapunan , JJ ., concur.",
