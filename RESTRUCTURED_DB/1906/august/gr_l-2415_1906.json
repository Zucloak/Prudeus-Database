No. L-2415            August 7, 1906\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\nplaintiff-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nJAMES W. WALSH, JR.,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nGustave L. Solignac, for appellant.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta, for appellee.\n\nTRACEY,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe defendant was charged under article 390 of the Penal Code with embezzlement of public property to the amount of P7,000, Philippine currency, which had come into his hands as Constabulary supply officer. He was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Masbate of the misappropriation of commissionary stores and quartermaster supplies of the value of P4,055.36, Philippine currency, and sentenced to imprisonment\n\n(prision mayor)\n\nfor ten years, with costs. The evidence fully supports the conclusions of the trial judge as to the misappropriation of the property, its character, and value.\n\nOn the proceeding day, in the same court, the defendant had been tried and convicted and was, on the date of the trial therein, sentenced to ten years of\n\npresidio mayor\n\nfor the embezzlement of Government funds while holding office as such officer. The dates covered by both charges and the witness heard were the same; both complaints were made under the same article of the code, the only difference being that in the first case the property was specified to be money and in the second stores and supplies.\n\nWe are of opinion that in these two cases but one crime was charged, for which he could not be twice put in jeopardy. The offense under article 390 can not be divided into as many crimes as there are public articles or classes of article unaccounted for by the accused official. In this respect it differs from successive thefts of distinct articles. The defendant has been already tried and punished for this crime. He asserted this defense in the only way at that time available, in objecting to testimony and in his motion for a new trial, based upon copies of the complaint and sentence in the first case.\n\nThis judgment proceeds solely upon the ground that the defendant has already been tried and convicted of this offense.\n\nThe judgment of the lower court is reversed and the accused is ordered discharge at the expiration of the term of his first sentence, but without prejudice to any right that the government may have to proceed civilly against him or his sureties, with costs\n\nde oficio\n\n.\n\nAt the expiration of ten days judgment should be entered in accordance with this decision and the case remanded to the court below for execution of said judgment. So ordered.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa and Willard, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
