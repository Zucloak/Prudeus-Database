No. L-6888            January 2, 1912\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\nplaintiff-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nFILEMON TAMARRA,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nFilemon Sotto, for appellant.\n\nActing Attorney-General Harvey, for appellee.\n\nMORELAND,\n\nJ.\n\n:\n\nThe defendant in this case was convicted of having in his possession lottery tickets with intent to sell the same. The judgment of conviction is based upon the plea of guilty of the accused. The only error assigned on this appeal that can be considered by this court are (\n\na\n\n) that relating to the penalty and (\n\nb\n\n) that which touches the question of double jeopardy.\n\nIt appears that the accused was arrested charged with the crime of running a lottery. Upon being arraigned he asserted that he was not guilty of that crime but was guilty of having in his possession lottery tickets with intent to sell the same. The court thereupon ordered the information amended so as to charge the crime of having possession of lottery tickets with intent to sell. To this procedure the accused made no objection and upon presentation of the new information, and after the formalities accompanying his arraignment, he pleaded guilty and was duly sentenced by the court. Under the facts there is presented for our consideration from the aspect of the appeal no question whatever.\n\nAs to the penalty imposed, we are of the opinion that it too severe. It is, therefore, hereby modified and the defendant sentenced to pay the fine of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment as provided by law in case of non-payment.\n\nTorres, Mapa, Johnson and Trent, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
