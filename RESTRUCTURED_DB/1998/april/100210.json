  "title": "THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HON. OSCAR B. PIMENTEL, AS JUDGE, RTC OF MAKATI, METRO MANILA, BRANCH 148 AND ANTONIO A. TUJAN, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N MARTINEZ, J.: Is the Court of Appeals, in affirming the order of the Regional Trial Court, correct in ruling that Subversion is the âmain offenseâ in a charge of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion under P.D. No. 1866, as amended, and that, therefore, the said charge should be quashed in view of a previous charge of Subversion under R.A. No. 1700, as amended by P.D. No. 885, against the same accused pending in another court? Stated differently, is the accused charged with the same offense in both cases, which would justify the dismissal of the second charge on the ground of double jeopardy? This is the pith issue presented before us in this appeal by certiorari interposed by the People under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, seeking a review of the decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (Sixteenth Division) dated May 27, 1991, in CA-G.R. SP No. 24273, entitled âTHE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, Petitioner, versus HON. OSCAR B. PIMENTEL, as Judge, RTC of Makati, Metro Manila, Branch 148 and ANTONIO A. TUJAN, Respondents.â The record discloses the following antecedent facts: As early as 1983, private respondent Antonio Tujan was charged with Subversion under Republic Act No. 1700 (the Anti-Subversion Law), as amended, before the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45), National Capital Region, docketed as Criminal Case No. 64079.[2] As a consequence thereof, a warrant for his arrest was issued on July 29, 1983,[3] but it remained unserved as he could not be found. Almost seven (7) years thereafter, or on June 5, 1990, Antonio Tujan was arrested on the basis of the warrant of arrest in the subversion case.[4] When arrested, an unlicensed .38 caliber special revolver and six (6) rounds of live ammunition were found in his possession.[5] Consequently, on June 14, 1990, Antonio Tujan was charged with Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion under Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, before the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch 148), docketed as Criminal Case No. 1789. The Information reads: âThat on or about the 5th day of June, 1990, in the Municipality of ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being a member of a communist party of the Philippines, and its front organization, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody, in furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of subversion, a special edition ARMSCOR PHILS. caliber .38 special revolver with Serial No. 1026387 and with six (6) live ammunitions, without first securing the necessary license or permit thereof from competent government authority.â[6] The above Information recommended no bail for Antonio Tujan, which recommendation was approved by the trial court in an Order dated June 19, 1990.[7] The same order also directed the continued detention of Antonio Tujan at MIG 15 of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP), Bago Bantay, Quezon City, while his case is pending. On June 26, 1990, Antonio Tujan, through counsel, filed a motion[8] invoking his right to a preliminary investigation pursuant to Section 7, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Court and praying that his arraignment be held in abeyance until the preliminary investigation is terminated. However, on June 27, 1990, during the hearing of Antonio Tujanâs motion for preliminary investigation, his counsel withdrew the motion since he would file a motion to quash the Information, for which reason counsel requested a period of twenty (20) days to do so. This was granted by the trial court on that same day.[9] On July 16, 1990, Antonio Tujan did file the motion to quash[10] the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789 on the ground that he âhas been previously in jeopardy of being convicted of the offense chargedâ in Criminal Case No. 64079 (for subversion) of the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45). The said ground is based on Sections 3 (h) and 7, Rule 117 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure. In support of the motion, Antonio Tujan contends that âcommon crimes such as illegal possession of firearms and ammunition should actually be deemed absorbed in subversion,â[11] citing the cases of Misolas vs. Panga, et al. (G. R. No. 83341, January 30, 1990, 181 SCRA 648) and Enrile vs. Salazar, et al. (G. R. No. 92163, June 5, 1990, 186 SCRA 217). Antonio Tujan then avers that âthe present case is the twin prosecutionâ of âthe earlier subversion caseâ and, therefore, he âis entitled to invoke the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.â[12] The petitioner opposed[13] the motion to quash, arguing that Antonio Tujan does not stand in jeopardy of being convicted a second time because: (a) he has not even been arraigned in the subversion case, and (b) the offense charged against him in Criminal Case No. 64079 is for Subversion, punishable under Republic Act No. 1700; while the present case is for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion, punishable under a different law (Presidential Decree No. 1866). Moreover, petitioner contends that Antonio Tujanâs reliance on the Misolas and Enrile cases âis misplaced.â[14] Tujan merely relies on the dissenting opinions in the Misolas case. Also, the Enrile case which involved a complex crime of rebellion with murder is inapplicable to the instant case which is not a complex offense. Thus, the âabsorption ruleâ as held applicable in the Enrile ruling âhas no room for application in the present case because (illegal) possession of firearm and ammunition is not a necessary means of committing the offense of subversion, nor is subversion a necessary means of committing the crime of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition.â[15] The trial court, in an order dated October 12, 1990, granted the motion to quash the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789, the dispositive portion of the order reading: âWHEREFORE, the motion to quash the information is hereby GRANTED, but only in so far as the accused may be placed in jeopardy or in danger of being convicted or acquitted of the crime of Subversion and as a consequence the Information is hereby quashed and the case dismissed without prejudice to the filing of Illegal Possession of Firearm. âSO ORDERED.â[16] It is best to quote the disquisition of the respondent court in quashing the information and dismissing the case: âx x x x x x x x x âIn other words, the main offense the accused is being charged in this case is also Subversion considering that the alleged Illegal Possession of the Firearm and Ammunition is only in furtherance thereof. âNow, subversion being a continuing offense as has been previously held by the Supreme Court, the fact that the accused has been previously charged of Subversion before another court before the institution of this instant case is just a continuing offense of his former charge or that his acts constituting subversion is a continuation of the acts he committed before. âThe court therefore cannot subscribe to the position taken by the prosecution that this case is very different from the other case and that double jeopardy will attach in this particular case. âThis court agrees with the position taken by the defense that double jeopardy will attach to the accusation of subversion, punishable now under Republic Act 1700, as Rule 117 of the Rules of Court particularly Section 1 thereof, provides: âTime to move to quash- At any time before entering his plea, the accused may move to quash the complaint or information.(1a)â âIn other words, there is no necessity that the accused should be arraigned first before he can move to quash the information. It is before he pleads which the accused did in this case. âOn the other submissions by the prosecution, that the possession of firearms and ammunitions is not a necessary means of committing the offense of subversion or vice versa, then if the court follows such argument, there could be no offense of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in furtherance of Subversion, for even the prosecution admits also that in subversion which is an offense involving propaganda, counter propaganda, a battle of the hearts and mind of the people does not need the possession or use of firearms and ammunitions. âThe prosecution even admits and to quote: âThe defense of double jeopardy, while unquestionably available to the accused, had not been clearly shown to be invokable(sic) at this point in time.â âBut the rule says otherwise as previously stated as provided for under Section 1 of Rule 117 of the Rules of Court. âThus, if ever the accused is caught in possession of a firearm and ammunition which is separate and distinct from the crime of subversion and is not a necessary ingredient thereof and the court believed so, the prosecution will have to file another information as they may wish. The court therefore has to grant the motion to quash on the aforestated grounds, subject to Section 5 of Rule 117, considering that the only offense to which the accused in this case may be placed in jeopardy is Subversion and not Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunitions. âThe prosecution may file any information as warranted within ten (10) days from receipt of this order otherwise the court will order the release of the accused, unless he is in custody for some other offense.â[17] (Emphasis ours) Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration[18] was also denied in an order dated December 28, 1990.[19] The petitioner elevated the case to the Court of Appeals through a petition for certiorari, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 24273. However, the appellate court found that the trial court did not commit any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in quashing the questioned Information. In dismissing the petition, the appellate court, in its decision dated May 27, 1991, basically reiterated the aforequoted ruling of the trial court. Petitioner now comes to this Court, claiming that: (1) the decision of the Court of Appeals is not in accord with the law and applicable jurisprudence; and (2) it was deprived of due process to prosecute and prove its case against private respondent Antonio Tujan in Criminal Case No. 1789. We agree with the petitioner. The Court of Appeals considered as duplicitous the Information for violation of P.D. No. 1866 filed against private respondent Antonio Tujan. It ruled: âThe foregoing information (for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion) filed before the Makati court shows that the main case is subversion considering that there is an allegation that the alleged illegal possession of firearms was made âin furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of subversion.â Also, the information alleged likewise that the accused is a member of a communist party of the Philippines and its front organization. Basically, the information refers to the crime of Subversion qualified by Illegal Possession of Firearms. x x x.â[20] The ruling of the Court of Appeals is erroneous. Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866, under which Antonio Tujan is charged in Criminal Case No. 1789 before the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch 148), provides as follows: âSection 1. Unlawful Manufacture, Sales, Acquisition, Disposition or Possession of Firearms or Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition. â The penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess any firearms, part of firearm, ammunition, or machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition. âIf homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearms, the penalty of death shall be imposed. âIf the violation of this Section is in furtherance of, or incident to, or in connection with the crimes of rebellion, insurrection or subversion, the penalty of death shall be imposed. âThe penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the owner, president, manager, director or other responsible officer of any public or private firm, company, corporation or entity, who shall willfully or knowingly allow any of the firearms owned by such firm, company, corporation or entity to be used by any person or persons found guilty of violating the provisions of the preceding paragraphs. âThe penalty of prision mayor shall be imposed upon any person who shall carry any licensed firearm outside his residence without legal authority therefor.â (Emphasis ours) The above-quoted provisions of P.D. No. 1866 are plain and simple. Under the first paragraph of Section 1, the mere possession of an unlicensed firearm or ammunition is the crime itself which carries the penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua. The third paragraph of the same Section makes the use of said firearm and ammunition âin furtherance of, or incident to, or in connection with the crimes of rebellion, insurrection or subversionâ a circumstance to increase the penalty to death. Thus, the allegation in the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789 that the unlicensed firearm found in the possession of Antonio Tujan, âa member of the communist party of the Philippines and its front organization,â was used âin furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of subversionâ does not charge him with the separate and distinct crime of Subversion in the same Information, but simply describes the mode or manner by which the violation of Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866 was committed[21] so as to qualify the penalty to death. There is, therefore, only one offense charged in the questioned information, that is, the illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, qualified by its being used in furtherance of subversion.[22] There is nothing in P.D. No. 1866, specifically Section 1 thereof, which decrees categorically or by implication that the crimes of rebellion, insurrection or subversion are the very acts that are being penalized. This is clear from the title of the law itself which boldly indicates the specific acts penalized under it: âCODIFYING THE LAWS ON ILLEGAL/UNLAWFUL POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE, DEALING IN, ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION, OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVES OR INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVES, AND IMPOSING STIFFER PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS THEREOF AND FOR RELEVANT PURPOSES.â (Emphasis ours) On the other hand, the previous subversion charge against Antonio Tujan in Criminal Case No. 64079, before the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45), is based on a different law, that is, Republic Act No. 1700, as amended. Section 3 thereof penalizes any person who âknowingly, wilfully and by overt act affiliates with, becomes or remains a member of a subversive association or organization x x x.â Section 4 of said law further penalizes âsuch member [of the Communist Party of the Philippines and/or its successor or of any subversive association] (who) takes up arms against the Government.â Thus, in the present case, private respondent Antonio Tujan could be charged either under P.D. No. 1866 or R.A. No. 1700,[23] or both. This leads us to the issue of whether or not private respondent Antonio Tujan was placed in double jeopardy with the filing of the second Information for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion. We rule in the negative. Article III of the Constitution provides: âSec. 21. No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. If an act is punished by a law and an ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to another prosecution for the same act.â (Emphasis ours) Complementing the above constitutional provision, Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court states: âSEC. 7. Former conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy. â When an accused has been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information. x x x x x x x x x.â The right of an accused against double jeopardy is a matter which he may raise in a motion to quash to defeat a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. The pertinent provision of Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court provides: âSEC. 3. Grounds. â The accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the following grounds: x x x x x x x x x (h) That the accused has been previously convicted or in jeopardy of being convicted, or acquitted of the offense charged. (2a)â (Emphasis ours) In order that the protection against double jeopardy may inure to the benefit of an accused, the following requisites must have obtained in the first criminal action: (a) a valid complaint or information; (b) a competent court; (c) the defendant had pleaded to the charge;[24] and (d) the defendant was acquitted, or convicted, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent.[25] Suffice it to say that in the present case, private respondentâs motion to quash filed in the trial court did not actually raise the issue of double jeopardy simply because it had not arisen yet. It is noteworthy that the private respondent has not even been arraigned in the first criminal action for subversion. Besides, as earlier discussed, the two criminal charges against private respondent are not of the same offense as required by Section 21, Article III of the Constitution. It is clear from the foregoing, that the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is not in accordance with the law and jurisprudence and thus should be reversed. While we hold that both the subversion charge under R.A. No. 1700, as amended, and the one for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition in furtherance of subversion under P.D. No. 1866, as amended, can co-exist, the subsequent enactment of Republic Act No. 7636 on September 22, 1992, totally repealing R.A. No. 1700, as amended, has substantially changed the complexion of the present case, inasmuch as the said repealing law being favorable to the accused-private respondent, who is not a habitual delinquent, should be given retroactive effect.[26] Although this legal effect of R.A. No. 7636 on private-respondentâs case has never been raised as an issue by the parties â obviously because the said law came out only several months after the questioned decision of the Court of Appeals was promulgated and while the present petition is pending with this Court â we should nonetheless fulfill our duty as a court of justice by applying the law to whomsoever is benefited by it regardless of whether or not the accused or any party has sought the application of the beneficent provisions of the repealing law.[27] That R.A. No. 7636 should apply retroactively to accused-private respondent is beyond question. The repeal by said law of R.A. No. 1700, as amended, was categorical, definite and absolute. There was no saving clause in the repeal. The legislative intent of totally abrogating the old anti-subversion law is clear. Thus, it would be illogical for the trial courts to try and sentence the accused-private respondent for an offense that no longer exists.[28] As early as 1935, we ruled in People vs. Tamayo:[29] âThere is no question that at common law and in America a much more favorable attitude towards the accused exists relative to statutes that have been repealed than has been adopted here. Our rule is more in conformity with the Spanish doctrine, but even in Spain, where the offense ceases to be criminal, prosecution cannot be had. (1 Pacheco Commentaries, 296)â (Emphasis ours) Where, as here, the repeal of a penal law is total and absolute and the act which was penalized by a prior law ceases to be criminal under the new law, the previous offense is obliterated.[30] It is a recognized rule in this jurisdiction that a total repeal deprives the courts of jurisdiction to try, convict and sentence persons charged with violation of the old law prior to the repeal.[31] With the enactment of R.A. No. 7636, the charge of subversion against the accused-private respondent has no more legal basis and should be dismissed. As regards the other charge of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, qualified by subversion, this charge should be amended to simple illegal possession of firearm and ammunition since, as earlier discussed, subversion is no longer a crime. Moreover, the offense of simple illegal possession of firearm and ammunition is now bailable under Republic Act No. 8294 which was enacted on June 6, 1997. R.A. No. 8294 has amended Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, by eliminating the provision in said P.D. that if the unlicensed firearm is used in furtherance of subversion, the penalty of death shall be imposed.[32] Under the new law (R.A. No. 8294), the penalty prescribed for simple illegal possession of firearm (.38 caliber) is now reduced to prision correccional in its maximum period and a fine of not less than Fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00).[33] The reduced penalty of imprisonment - which is four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) years - entitles the accused-private respondent to bail. Considering, however, that the accused-private respondent has been detained since his arrest on June 5, 1990 up to the present (as far as our record has shown), or more than seven (7) years now, his immediate release is in order. This is so because even if he were convicted for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, the length of his detention while his case is pending has already exceeded the penalty prescribed by the new law. WHEREFORE, the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 27, 1991, in CA-G.R. SP No. 24273, including the orders dated October 12, 1990 and December 28, 1990 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch 148), National Capital Region, in Criminal Case No. 1789, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The subversion charge against accused-private respondent Antonio A. Tujan in Criminal Case No. 64079 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 45, is hereby DISMISSED. The other Information for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition in furtherance of subversion against the same accused in Criminal Case No. 1789 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 148, is DEEMED AMENDED to Simple Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition. The accused-appellant is hereby ordered RELEASED IMMEDIATELY from detention for the reason stated above, unless he is being detained for any other offense. This decision is IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY. No pronouncement as to costs. SO ORDERED. Narvasa, C.J., Regalado, Davide, Jr., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing. and Purisima, JJ., concur.

SP\nNo. 24273, entitled âTHE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, Petitioner, versus HON.\nOSCAR B. PIMENTEL, as Judge, RTC of Makati, Metro Manila, Branch 148 and\nANTONIO A. TUJAN, Respondents.â\n\nThe record discloses the following antecedent facts: As early as 1983, private respondent Antonio Tujan was charged with\nSubversion under Republic Act No. 1700 (the Anti-Subversion Law), as amended,\nbefore the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45), National Capital Region,\ndocketed as Criminal Case No. 64079. [2] As a consequence thereof, a warrant for his arrest was issued on July 29, 1983, [3] but it remained unserved as he could not be found. Almost seven (7) years thereafter,\nor on June 5, 1990, Antonio Tujan was arrested on the basis of the warrant of\narrest in the subversion case. [4] When arrested, an unlicensed .38 caliber special\nrevolver and six (6) rounds of live ammunition were found in his possession. [5]\n\nConsequently, on June 14, 1990, Antonio Tujan was charged with\nIllegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion under\nPresidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, before the Regional Trial Court of\nMakati (Branch 148), docketed as Criminal Case No. 1789. The Information reads: â That on or about the 5 th day of June, 1990, in the Municipality of ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila,\nPhilippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the\nabove-named accused, being a member of a communist party of the Philippines,\nand its front organization, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously have in his possession, control and custody, in furtherance of or\nincident to, or in connection with the crime of subversion, a special edition\nARMSCOR PHILS. caliber .38 special revolver with Serial No. 1026387 and with\nsix (6) live ammunitions, without first securing the necessary license or\npermit thereof from competent government authority.â [6]\n\nThe above Information recommended no bail for Antonio Tujan, which\nrecommendation was approved by the trial court in an Order dated June 19, 1990. [7] The same order also directed the continued detention of Antonio Tujan at MIG 15\nof the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP),\nBago Bantay, Quezon City, while his case is pending.\n\nOn June 26, 1990, Antonio Tujan, through counsel, filed a motion [8] invoking his right to a preliminary investigation pursuant to Section 7, Rule\n112 of the Revised Rules of Court and praying that his arraignment be held in\nabeyance until the preliminary investigation is terminated.\n\nHowever, on June 27, 1990, during the hearing of Antonio Tujanâs\nmotion for preliminary investigation, his counsel withdrew the motion since he\nwould file a motion to quash the Information, for which reason counsel\nrequested a period of twenty (20) days to do so. This was granted by the trial court on that same day. [9]\n\nOn July 16, 1990, Antonio Tujan did file the motion to quash [10] the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789 on the ground that he âhas been previously in jeopardy of being\nconvicted of the offense chargedâ in Criminal Case No. 64079 (for subversion)\nof the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45). The said ground is based on Sections 3 (h) and 7, Rule 117 of the\n1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure. In\nsupport of the motion, Antonio Tujan contends that âcommon crimes such as\nillegal possession of firearms and ammunition should actually be deemed\nabsorbed in subversion,â [11] citing the cases of Misolas vs. Panga, et al . (G. R. No. 83341, January\n30, 1990, 181 SCRA 648) and Enrile vs. Salazar, et al. (G. R. No. 92163,\nJune 5, 1990, 186 SCRA 217). Antonio\nTujan then avers that âthe present case is the twin prosecutionâ of âthe\nearlier subversion caseâ and, therefore, he âis entitled to invoke the\nconstitutional protection against double jeopardy.â [12]\n\nThe petitioner opposed [13] the motion to quash, arguing that Antonio Tujan does not stand in jeopardy of\nbeing convicted a second time because: (a) he has not even been arraigned in\nthe subversion case, and (b) the offense charged against him in Criminal Case\nNo. 64079 is for Subversion, punishable under Republic Act No. 1700; while the\npresent case is for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance\nof Subversion, punishable under a different\nlaw (Presidential Decree No. 1866). Moreover, petitioner contends that Antonio Tujanâs reliance on the Misolas and Enrile cases âis misplaced.â [14] Tujan merely relies on the dissenting opinions in the Misolas case. Also, the Enrile case which involved a complex crime of rebellion\nwith murder is inapplicable to the instant case which is not a complex\noffense. Thus, the âabsorption ruleâ as\nheld applicable in the Enrile ruling âhas no room for application in the\npresent case because (illegal) possession of firearm and ammunition is not a\nnecessary means of committing the offense of subversion, nor is subversion a\nnecessary means of committing the crime of illegal possession of firearm and\nammunition.â [15]\n\nThe trial court, in an order dated October 12, 1990, granted the\nmotion to quash the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789, the dispositive\nportion of the order reading: âWHEREFORE, the motion to quash the information is hereby\nGRANTED, but only in so far as the accused may be placed in jeopardy or in\ndanger of being convicted or acquitted of the crime of Subversion and as a\nconsequence the Information is hereby quashed and the case dismissed without\nprejudice to the filing of Illegal Possession of Firearm. âSO ORDERED.â [16]\n\nIt is best to quote the disquisition of the respondent court in\nquashing the information and dismissing the case:\n\nâx x x x x x x x x âIn other words, the main offense the accused is being charged\nin this case is also Subversion considering that the alleged Illegal Possession\nof the Firearm and Ammunition is only in furtherance thereof. âNow, subversion being a continuing offense as has been previously\nheld by the Supreme Court, the fact that the accused has been previously\ncharged of Subversion before another court before the institution of this\ninstant case is just a continuing offense of his former charge or that his acts\nconstituting subversion is a continuation of the acts he committed before. âThe court therefore cannot subscribe to the position taken by the\nprosecution that this case is very different from the other case and that\ndouble jeopardy will attach in this particular case. âThis court agrees with the position taken by the defense that\ndouble jeopardy will attach to the accusation of subversion, punishable now under\nRepublic Act 1700, as Rule 117 of the Rules of Court particularly Section 1\nthereof, provides:\n\nâTime to move to quash- At\nany time before entering his plea, the accused may move to quash the complaint\nor information.(1a)â âIn other words, there is no necessity that the accused should be\narraigned first before he can move to quash the information. It is before he pleads which the accused did\nin this case. âOn the other submissions by the prosecution, that the possession\nof firearms and ammunitions is not a necessary means of committing the offense\nof subversion or vice versa, then if the court follows such argument, there\ncould be no offense of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in\nfurtherance of Subversion, for even the prosecution admits also that in\nsubversion which is an offense involving propaganda, counter propaganda, a\nbattle of the hearts and mind of the people does not need the possession or use\nof firearms and ammunitions. âThe prosecution even admits and to quote:\n\nâThe defense of double jeopardy, while unquestionably available to\nthe accused, had not been clearly shown to be invokable(sic) at this point in\ntime.â âBut the rule says otherwise as previously stated as provided for\nunder Section 1 of Rule 117 of the Rules of Court. â Thus, if ever the accused is caught in possession of a firearm\nand ammunition which is separate and distinct from the crime of subversion and\nis not a necessary ingredient thereof and the court believed so, the\nprosecution will have to file another information as they may wish. The court therefore has to grant the motion\nto quash on the aforestated grounds, subject to Section 5 of Rule 117,\nconsidering that the only offense to which the accused in this case may be placed\nin jeopardy is Subversion and not Illegal Possession of Firearms and\nAmmunitions . âThe prosecution may file any\ninformation as warranted within ten (10) days from receipt of this order\notherwise the court will order the release of the accused, unless he is in\ncustody for some other offense.â [17] (Emphasis ours)\n\nPetitionerâs motion for reconsideration [18] was also denied in an order dated December 28, 1990. [19]\n\nThe petitioner elevated the case to the Court of Appeals through\na petition for certiorari , docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 24273. However, the appellate court found that the\ntrial court did not commit any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or\nexcess of jurisdiction in quashing the questioned Information. In dismissing the petition, the appellate court,\nin its decision dated May 27, 1991, basically reiterated the aforequoted ruling\nof the trial court.\n\nPetitioner now comes to this Court, claiming that: (1) the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals is not in accord with the law and applicable\njurisprudence; and (2) it was deprived of due process to prosecute and prove\nits case against private respondent Antonio Tujan in Criminal Case No. 1789.\n\nWe agree with the petitioner.\n\nThe Court of Appeals considered as duplicitous the Information\nfor violation of P.D. No. 1866 filed\nagainst private respondent Antonio Tujan. It ruled: âThe foregoing information (for\nIllegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion)\nfiled before the Makati court shows that the main case is subversion\nconsidering that there is an allegation that the alleged illegal possession of\nfirearms was made âin furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the\ncrime of subversion.â Also, the\ninformation alleged likewise that the accused is a member of a communist party\nof the Philippines and its front organization. Basically, the information refers to the crime of Subversion qualified\nby Illegal Possession of Firearms. x x\nx.â [20]\n\nThe ruling of the Court of Appeals is erroneous.\n\nSection 1 of Presidential\nDecree No. 1866, under which Antonio Tujan is charged in Criminal Case No. 1789\nbefore the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch 148), provides as follows: âSection 1. Unlawful Manufacture, Sales, Acquisition, Disposition or Possession of Firearms or\nAmmunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of\nFirearms or Ammunition. â The penalty of reclusion temporal in its\nmaximum period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon any person\nwho shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess\nany firearms, part of firearm, ammunition , or machinery, tool or instrument\nused or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition. âIf homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed\nfirearms, the penalty of death shall be imposed. â If the violation of this Section is in furtherance of, or\nincident to, or in connection with the crimes of rebellion, insurrection or\nsubversion, the penalty of death shall be imposed . âThe penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion\nperpetua shall be imposed upon the owner, president, manager, director or\nother responsible officer of any public or private firm, company, corporation\nor entity, who shall willfully or knowingly allow any of the firearms owned by\nsuch firm, company, corporation or entity to be used by any person or persons\nfound guilty of violating the provisions of the preceding paragraphs. âThe penalty of prision mayor shall be imposed upon any\nperson who shall carry any licensed firearm outside his residence without legal\nauthority therefor.â (Emphasis ours)\n\nThe above-quoted provisions of P.D. No. 1866 are plain and simple. Under the first paragraph of Section 1, the mere possession of an unlicensed firearm or ammunition is the crime itself which\ncarries the penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion\nperpetua . The third paragraph of\nthe same Section makes the use of said firearm and ammunition âin\nfurtherance of, or incident to, or in connection with the crimes of rebellion,\ninsurrection or subversionâ a circumstance to increase the penalty to death. Thus, the allegation in the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789\nthat the unlicensed firearm found in the possession of Antonio Tujan, âa member\nof the communist party of the Philippines and its front organization,â was used\nâin furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of\nsubversionâ does not charge him with the separate and distinct crime of\nSubversion in the same Information, but simply describes the mode or manner by\nwhich the violation of Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866 was committed [21] so as to qualify the penalty to death.\n\nThere is, therefore, only one offense charged in the\nquestioned information, that is, the illegal possession of firearm and\nammunition , qualified by its being used in furtherance of subversion. [22] There is nothing in P.D. No. 1866, specifically Section 1 thereof, which\ndecrees categorically or by implication that the crimes of rebellion,\ninsurrection or subversion are the very acts that are being penalized. This is clear from the title of the law\nitself which boldly indicates the specific acts penalized under it: âCODIFYING THE LAWS ON ILLEGAL/UNLAWFUL POSSESSION , MANUFACTURE , DEALING IN , ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION , OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVES OR INSTRUMENTS\nUSED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVES, AND IMPOSING\nSTIFFER PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS THEREOF AND FOR RELEVANT\nPURPOSES.â (Emphasis ours)\n\nOn the other hand, the previous subversion charge against Antonio\nTujan in Criminal Case No. 64079, before the Regional Trial Court of Manila\n(Branch 45), is based on a different law, that is, Republic Act No. 1700, as\namended. Section 3 thereof penalizes\nany person who âknowingly, wilfully and by overt act affiliates with, becomes\nor remains a member of a subversive association or organization x x x.â Section 4 of said law further penalizes\nâsuch member [of the Communist Party of the Philippines and/or its successor or\nof any subversive association] (who) takes up arms against the\nGovernment.â Thus, in the present case,\nprivate respondent Antonio Tujan could be charged either under P.D. No. 1866 or\nR.A. No. 1700, [23] or both.\n\nThis leads us to the issue of whether or not private respondent\nAntonio Tujan was placed in double jeopardy with the filing of the second\nInformation for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of\nSubversion.\n\nWe rule in the negative.\n\nArticle III of the Constitution provides: âSec. 21. No person shall\nbe twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense . If an act is punished by a law and an\nordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to\nanother prosecution for the same act.â (Emphasis ours)\n\nComplementing the above constitutional provision, Rule 117 of the\nRevised Rules of Court states: âSEC. 7. Former\nconviction or acquittal; double jeopardy. â When an accused has been\nconvicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise\nterminated without his express consent by a court of competent jurisdiction,\nupon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form\nand substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the\ncharge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case\nshall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any\nattempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which\nnecessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the\nformer complaint or information.\n\nx x x x x x x\nx x.â\n\nThe right of an accused against double jeopardy is a matter which\nhe may raise in a motion to quash to defeat a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. The pertinent provision of\nRule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court provides: âSEC. 3. Grounds. â\nThe accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the\nfollowing grounds:\n\nx x x x\nx x x x x (h) That the accused has been previously convicted or in\njeopardy of being convicted , or acquitted of the offense charged.\n(2a)â (Emphasis ours)\n\nIn order that the protection against double jeopardy may inure to\nthe benefit of an accused, the following requisites must have obtained in the first criminal action: (a) a valid complaint or information; (b) a competent court;\n(c) the defendant had pleaded to the charge; [24] and (d) the defendant was acquitted, or convicted, or the case against him was\ndismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent. [25]\n\nSuffice it to say that in the present case, private respondentâs\nmotion to quash filed in the trial court did not actually raise the issue of\ndouble jeopardy simply because it had not arisen yet. It is noteworthy that the private respondent has not even been\narraigned in the first criminal action for subversion. Besides, as earlier discussed, the two\ncriminal charges against private respondent are not of the same offense\nas required by Section 21, Article III of the Constitution.\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing, that the assailed decision of the\nCourt of Appeals is not in accordance with the law and jurisprudence and thus\nshould be reversed.\n\nWhile we hold that both the subversion charge under R.A. No.\n1700, as amended, and the one for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition\nin furtherance of subversion under P.D. No. 1866, as amended, can co-exist, the subsequent enactment of Republic Act No. 7636 on September 22, 1992, totally repealing R.A. No. 1700, as amended, has substantially changed the\ncomplexion of the present case, inasmuch as the said repealing law being\nfavorable to the accused-private respondent, who is not a habitual delinquent,\nshould be given retroactive effect. [26]\n\nAlthough this legal effect of R.A. No. 7636 on\nprivate-respondentâs case has never been raised as an issue by the parties â\nobviously because the said law came out only several months after the\nquestioned decision of the Court of Appeals was promulgated and while the\npresent petition is pending with this Court â we should nonetheless fulfill our\nduty as a court of justice by applying the law to whomsoever is benefited by it\nregardless of whether or not the accused or any party has sought the\napplication of the beneficent provisions of the repealing law. [27]\n\nThat R.A. No. 7636 should apply retroactively to accused-private\nrespondent is beyond question. The\nrepeal by said law of R.A. No. 1700, as amended, was categorical, definite and\nabsolute. There was no saving clause in\nthe repeal. The legislative intent of\ntotally abrogating the old anti-subversion law is clear. Thus, it would be illogical for the trial\ncourts to try and sentence the accused-private respondent for an offense that\nno longer exists. [28]\n\nAs early as 1935, we ruled in People vs. Tamayo : [29] âThere is no question that at common law and in America a much more\nfavorable attitude towards the accused exists relative to statutes that have\nbeen repealed than has been adopted here. Our rule is more in conformity with the Spanish doctrine, but even in\nSpain, where the offense ceases to be criminal, prosecution cannot be had .\n(1 Pacheco Commentaries, 296)â (Emphasis ours)\n\nWhere, as here, the repeal of a penal law is total and absolute\nand the act which was penalized by a prior law ceases to be criminal under the\nnew law, the previous offense is obliterated. [30] It is a recognized rule in this jurisdiction that a total repeal deprives the\ncourts of jurisdiction to try, convict and sentence persons charged with\nviolation of the old law prior to the repeal. [31]\n\nWith the enactment of R.A. No. 7636, the charge of subversion\nagainst the accused-private respondent has no more legal basis and should be\ndismissed.\n\nAs regards the other charge of illegal possession of firearm and\nammunition, qualified by subversion, this charge should be amended to simple\nillegal possession of firearm and ammunition since, as earlier discussed,\nsubversion is no longer a crime.\n\nMoreover, the offense of simple illegal possession of firearm and\nammunition is now bailable under Republic Act No. 8294 which was enacted on\nJune 6, 1997. R.A. No. 8294 has amended\nPresidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, by eliminating the provision in said\nP.D. that if the unlicensed firearm is used in furtherance of subversion, the\npenalty of death shall be imposed. [32] Under the new law (R.A. No. 8294), the penalty prescribed for simple illegal\npossession of firearm (.38 caliber) is now reduced to prision correccional in\nits maximum period and a fine of not less than Fifteen thousand pesos ( P 15,000.00). [33] The reduced penalty of imprisonment - which is four (4) years, two (2) months\nand one (1) day to six (6) years - entitles the accused-private respondent to\nbail. Considering, however, that the\naccused-private respondent has been detained since his arrest on June 5, 1990\nup to the present (as far as our record has shown), or more than seven (7)\nyears now, his immediate release is in order. This is so because even if he were convicted for illegal possession of\nfirearm and ammunition, the length of his detention while his case is pending\nhas already exceeded the penalty prescribed by the new law.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals\ndated May 27, 1991, in CA-G.R. SP No. 24273, including the orders dated October\n12, 1990 and December 28, 1990 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch\n148), National Capital Region, in Criminal Case No. 1789, are hereby REVERSED\nand SET ASIDE.\n\nThe subversion charge against accused-private respondent Antonio\nA. Tujan in Criminal Case No. 64079 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila,\nBranch 45, is hereby DISMISSED.\n\nThe other Information for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition\nin furtherance of subversion against the same accused in Criminal Case No. 1789\nof the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 148, is DEEMED AMENDED to Simple\nIllegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition . The accused-appellant is hereby ordered RELEASED IMMEDIATELY from\ndetention for the reason stated above, unless he is being detained for any\nother offense.\n\nThis decision is IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.
