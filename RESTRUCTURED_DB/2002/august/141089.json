SABALBURO, AND MIRASOL G. SABALBURO, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N QUISUMBING, J.: On appeal is the decision[1] of the Court of Appeals promulgated on August 25, 1999 in CA-G.R. CV No. 45002, which affirmed in toto the judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 62, in Civil Case No. 16062. The trial court found herein petitioners liable for the death of Florentina Sabalburo in a vehicular accident involving a passenger bus owned by petitioner Metro Manila Transit Corporation (MMTC) and driven by petitioner Apolinario Ajoc, and ordered them to pay damages to private respondents. The factual backdrop of this case, as found by the Court of Appeals, is as follows: The eyewitness account of plaintiffsâ witness, Maria Zenaida Baylon, tends to show that in the afternoon of December 24, 1986, she, her daughter Maria Zenia and the victim, Florentina Sabalburo, were on their way to Baclaran to buy foodstuffs for their Noche Buena. For some time, they stood on the island at the intersection of St. Andrews Street[2] and Domestic Road, [Pasay City] waiting for the traffic light to change so they could cross to the other side of St. Andrews Street where they intended to take a ride for Baclaran. When the traffic light turned red and the vehicles along St. Andrews Street had stopped, the three of them stepped off the island. Just as they started to cross the street, she (Baylon) saw an MMTC bus coming from their right (Tramo) which was moving at a fast speed. The next moment, the left front portion of the bus hit the victim on the right side of her head. The impact was of such force that the victimâs right ear was slashed off and she thereupon fell on the cement and became unconscious. The victim was brought by the bus driver, Apolinario Ajoc and the bus conductress to the San Juan de Dios Hospital where she was given medical attention. Florentina Sabalburo never regained consciousness and it was on January 3, 1987 that she succumbed to her injuries.[3] On February 16, 1987, private respondents filed a complaint[4] for damages against MMTC and its driver, Ajoc, with the Regional Trial Court of Makati. Docketed as Civil Case No. 16062, the complaint essentially alleged that Ajoc drove the MMTC bus in a wanton and reckless manner, in gross violation of traffic rules and regulations, without due regard for the safety of others, thus causing the untimely death of the victim. Petitioners denied the material allegations of the complaint, disclaimed any liability for the incident, and insisted that the accident was solely due to the victimâs own negligence. The appellate court summed up their version of the incident as follows: x x x That at the time material to this case, bus no. 033, with defendant Ajoc driving, then bound towards the direction of Baclaran proper, was slowly accelerating speed on the outer right lane of the road, in response to the go signal of the traffic light situated in the intersection of Domestic Road [and Andrew Avenue], while the vehicles on the inner right lane which were going to turn left towards Domestic Road were at a stop position, the deceased FLORENTINA G. SABALBURO, whose stationary position was then covered from Ajocâs peripheral vision by a big truck then bound to MIA Road [that] was at a stop position, suddenly, without regard to her own safety and in total defiance of traffic signs designed to protect pedestrian[s], suddenly darted across the road; Ajoc, thus caught by surprise, tried to prevent impact by releasing his accelerator pedal and applying his brakes but the time lag between the deceasedâs negligent act and Ajocâs prudent and diligent reaction to the former made the impact a certainty.[5] As special and affirmative defenses, petitioners also claimed that: (1) MMTC âhires its drivers, conductors and other employees only after they have successfully passed rigid and extensive theoretical and practical examinations designed to determine their skills and competenceâ¦and imposes upon its drivers the duty to undergo regular seminars in defensive driving techniques and road safety habits;â[6] (2) MMTC had âtaken every human care and foresight possible in carrying their passengers safely to their respective place (sic) of destination as well as in avoiding harm to the life and limbs or risk against pedestrians so that they not be held liable;â[7] and (3) â[T]he buses of the defendant corporation, including its bus no. 033 were all properly maintainedâ¦before the buses left the garage for their respective routes on that particular day, as in all other days, they were rigidly inspected and examined and properly certified as roadworthy.â[8] The trial court found private respondentsâ version more credible and on August 12, 1993, decided the case as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against defendants as follows: Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay plaintiff Martin Sabalburo actual damages in the sum of P63,943.88 representing the unpaid expenses of plaintiff in connection with the death of Florentina Sabalburo; Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay plaintiffs the sum of P180,000.00 for the loss of the earning capacity of the deceased for a period of ten (10) years; Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the amount of P500,000.00 as moral damages; Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; Ordering defendants [to] jointly and severally pay plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the sum of P50,000.00 as attorneyâs fees; Ordering defendants jointly and severally to pay plaintiffs the costs of this suit. SO ORDERED.[9] Petitioners seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals, which docketed their appeal as CA-G.R. CV No. 45002. Before the appellate court, petitioners insisted that the accident was solely the fault of the victim since she suddenly crossed a very busy street with complete disregard for her safety and in violation of traffic rules and regulations designed to protect pedestrians. As earlier stated, the appellate court, in CA-G.R. CV No. 45002, affirmed the trial courtâs decision, thus: IN JUDGMENT, we hold that the appeal interposed by appellants is not meritorious and the judgment of the lower court which we find to be in accordance with law and the evidence is therefore AFFIRMED in toto. Costs against appellants. SO ORDERED.[10] Petitioners then moved for reconsideration, but the appellate court denied their motion in its resolution of December 10, 1999.[11] Hence, the present petition. Petitioners submit as sole issue for our resolution the following: WHETHER OR NOT ARTICLE 2179[12] AS AN EXCEPTION TO ARTICLE 2176[13] OF THE CIVIL CODE IS APPLICABLE IN THE INSTANT CASE. Petitioners insist that a closer look at the facts established by the trial court would show that the incident happened at around 3:30 in the afternoon of December 24, 1986 or barely eight (8) hours before Christmas Eve. Thus, the victimâs thoughts were naturally directed towards the Noche Buena. The victim then crossed busy Andrew Avenue for the purpose of getting a ride to Baclaran to buy food for the Christmas Eve celebration. Since her thoughts were on the Christmas Eve feast, she crossed where there was no pedestrian lane and while the green light for vehicular traffic was on. Petitioner MMTC submits that petitioner Ajoc cannot be charged with negligence considering that he cannot see what is in the mind of a pedestrian. Considering that the victimâs own negligence was the direct and proximate cause of her injuries and untimely demise, it was error for the Court of Appeals not to have applied Article 2179 of the Civil Code to the instant case. Petitionersâ claim that at the time of the incident, the victimâs mind was preoccupied with the preparations for the Noche Buena, is naught but pure conjecture and speculation, with nary a scintilla of proof to support it, according to respondents. Both the trial and appellate courts established that the immediate and proximate cause of the victimâs death was the negligent and careless driving by petitioner Ajoc. Therefore, the full force of Article 2176 of the Civil Code applies, concluded respondents. In asking us to apply Article 2179 of the Civil Code, we note that petitioners are asking us to make a finding that the victimâs own negligence was the direct and proximate cause of her death. This we cannot do. The issue of whether a person is negligent or not is a question of fact.[14] The Supreme Court is not a trier of facts,[15] although it has the power and authority to review and reverse the factual findings of lower courts where these do not conform to the evidence[16] or where the courts below came up with contradictory factual findings.[17] We have thoroughly perused the records of this case, and nowhere do we find evidence to support petitionersâ claim that the victim was so engrossed in thinking about Noche Buena while crossing a busy street. Petitionersâ stance regarding the victimâs alleged negligence is non sequitur. It simply does not follow that one who is run over by a vehicle on Christmas Eve (or any other holiday for that matter) is negligent because his thoughts were on the holiday festivities. Instead, the records support private respondentsâ claim that the MMTC bus was being driven carelessly. As found by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the victim and her companions were standing on the island of Andrew Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change so they could cross. Upon seeing the red light, the victim and her companions started to cross. It was then when petitioner Ajoc, who was trying to beat the red light, hit the victim. As the court a quo noted, Ajocâs claim that âhe failed to see the victim and her companions proves his recklessness and lack of caution in driving his vehicle.â[18] Findings of fact of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are binding and conclusive on the Supreme Court.[19] More so, as in this case, where petitioners have not adequately shown that the courts below overlooked or disregarded certain facts or circumstances of such import as would have altered the outcome of the case. Contrary to petitionersâ insistence, the applicable law in this case is Article 2176 of the Civil Code and not Article 2179. Petitioner MMTC next contends that the Court of Appeals erred in finding it solidarily liable for damages with its driver/employee, Ajoc, pursuant to the relevant paragraphs of Article 2180[20] of the Civil Code. It argues that the act of Ajoc in bringing the victim to a hospital reflects MMTCâs diligence in the selection and supervision of its drivers, particularly with regard to safety measures. Hence, having exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its employees to prevent damage, MMTC should not be held vicariously liable. It should be stressed, however, that whenever an employeeâs negligence causes damage or injury to another, there instantly arises a presumption juris tantum that there was negligence on the part of the employer, either in the selection of the employee (culpa in eligiendo) or the supervision over him after the selection (culpa in vigilando).[21] Hence, to escape solidary liability for a quasi-delict committed by his employee, an employer must rebut the presumption by presenting convincing proof that in the selection and supervision of his employee, he has exercised the care and diligence of a good father of a family.[22] In the present case, petitioner MMTC failed to rebut the presumption of negligence on its part. The claim that Ajocâs act of bringing the victim to the nearest medical facility shows adequate supervision by MMTC over its employees deserves but scant consideration. For one, the act was after the fact of negligence on Ajocâs part. For another, the evidence on record shows that Ajocâs act was neither voluntary nor spontaneous; he had to be prevailed upon by the victimâs companions to render assistance to his victim.[23] Moreover, the evidence to show that MMTC had exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees consisted merely of the pertinent guidelines for the screening and selection of its drivers, as well as periodic seminars on road safety. As found by the trial court, and affirmed by the appellate court, petitioner MMTC failed to show that its driver, Ajoc, had actually undergone such screening or had attended said seminars. As previously held, â[t]he mere formulation of various company policies on safety without showing that they were being complied with is not sufficient to exempt (an employer) from liability arising from negligence of its employees. It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that in recruiting and employing the erring driver the recruitment procedures and company policies on efficiency and safety were followed.â[24] In this case, MMTC has made no satisfactory showing that it had paid more than lip service to its guidelines and policies in hiring and supervision. Its failure to do so cannot but warrant the proper sanctions from this Court, considering that MMTC is a government-owned public utility organized for the public welfare. Having failed to rebut the presumption of negligence on its part, MMTC is primarily and directly liable for the damages caused by its employee, the erring driver, Ajoc, pursuant to Article 2180 of the Civil Code, which provides as follows: ART. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for oneâs own acts or omissions-, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible. The father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the mother, are responsible for the damages caused by the minor children who live in their company. Guardians are liable for damages caused by the minors or incapacitated persons who are under their authority and live in their company. The owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages caused by their employees in the service of the branches in which the latter are employed or on the occasion of their functions. Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry. The State is responsible in like manner when it acts through a special agent; but not when the damage has been caused by the official to whom the task done properly pertains, in which case what is provided in Article 2176 shall be applicable. Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody. The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage. The owners of public utilities fall within the scope of this article.[25] As earlier stated, MMTC is a public utility, organized and owned by the government for public transport service. Hence, its liability to private respondents, for the negligent and reckless acts of its driver, Ajoc, under Article 2180 of the Civil Code is both manifest and clear. WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DISMISSED. The assailed decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 45002 is AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners. SO ORDERED.

When the plaintiffâs own negligence was the immediate and proximate cause of his injury, he cannot recover damages.

CV No. 45002, which affirmed in \ntoto the judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 62, in Civil\n Case No. 16062. The trial court found herein petitioners liable for the\n death of Florentina Sabalburo in a vehicular accident involving a \npassenger bus owned by petitioner Metro Manila Transit Corporation \n(MMTC) and driven by petitioner Apolinario Ajoc, and ordered them to pay\n damages to private respondents.\n\nThe factual backdrop of this case, as found by the Court of \nAppeals, is as follows:\n\nThe eyewitness account of plaintiffsâ witness, Maria \nZenaida \nBaylon, tends to show that in the afternoon of December 24, 1986, she, \nher daughter Maria Zenia and the victim, Florentina Sabalburo, were on \ntheir way to Baclaran to buy foodstuffs for their Noche \nBuena .

Florentina \nSabalburo never regained consciousness and it was on January 3, 1987 \nthat she succumbed to her injuries. [3]\n\nOn February 16, 1987, private respondents filed a \ncomplaint [4] for damages against MMTC and its driver, Ajoc, with the Regional Trial \nCourt of Makati. Docketed as Civil Case No. 16062, the complaint \nessentially alleged that Ajoc drove the MMTC bus in a wanton and \nreckless manner, in gross violation of traffic rules and regulations, \nwithout due regard for the safety of others, thus causing the untimely \ndeath of the victim.\n\nPetitioners denied the material allegations of the complaint,\n \ndisclaimed any liability for the incident, and insisted that the \naccident was solely due to the victimâs own negligence. The appellate \ncourt summed up their version of the incident as follows:\n\nx x x\n\nThat at the time material to this case, bus no. 033, with \ndefendant Ajoc driving, then bound towards the direction of Baclaran \nproper, was slowly accelerating speed on the outer right lane of the \nroad, in response to the go signal of the traffic light situated in the \nintersection of Domestic Road [and Andrew Avenue], while the vehicles on\n the inner right lane which were going to turn left towards Domestic \nRoad were at a stop position, the deceased FLORENTINA G.

[5]\n\nAs special and affirmative defenses, petitioners also claimed\n that:\n\n(1) MMTC âhires its drivers, conductors and other employees \nonly \nafter they have successfully passed rigid and extensive theoretical and \npractical examinations designed to determine their skills and \ncompetenceâ¦and imposes upon its drivers the duty to undergo regular \nseminars in defensive driving techniques and road safety habits;â [6]\n\n(2) MMTC had âtaken every human care and foresight possible \nin \ncarrying their passengers safely to their respective place (sic) of \ndestination as well as in avoiding harm to the life and limbs or risk \nagainst pedestrians so that they not be held liable;â [7] and\n\n(3) â[T]he buses of the defendant corporation, including its \nbus \nno. 033 were all properly maintainedâ¦before the buses left the garage \nfor their respective routes on that particular day, as in all other \ndays, they were rigidly inspected and examined and properly certified as\n roadworthy.â [8]\n\nThe trial court found private respondentsâ version more \ncredible and on August 12, 1993, decided the case as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered\n in favor of the plaintiff and against defendants as follows: Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay \nplaintiff \nMartin Sabalburo actual damages in the sum of P63,943.88 representing \nthe unpaid expenses of plaintiff in connection with the death of \nFlorentina Sabalburo; Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay\n \nplaintiffs the sum of P180,000.00 for the loss of the earning capacity \nof the deceased for a period of ten (10) years; Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay\n plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the amount of P500,000.00 as moral damages; Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay\n plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; Ordering defendants [to] jointly and severally \npay plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the sum of P50,000.00 as attorneyâs fees; Ordering defendants jointly and severally to pay\n plaintiffs the costs of this suit. SO ORDERED. [9]\n\nPetitioners seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals, which \ndocketed their appeal as CA-G.R. CV No. 45002.

[10]\n\nPetitioners then moved for reconsideration, but the appellate\n court denied their motion in its resolution of December 10, \n1999. [11]\n\nHence, the present petition.\n\nPetitioners submit as sole issue for our resolution the \nfollowing:\n\nWHETHER OR NOT ARTICLE 2179 [12] AS AN EXCEPTION TO ARTICLE 2176 [13] OF THE CIVIL CODE IS \nAPPLICABLE IN THE INSTANT CASE.\n\nPetitioners insist that a closer look at the facts \nestablished by \nthe trial court would show that the incident happened at around 3:30 in \nthe afternoon of December 24, 1986 or barely eight (8) hours before \nChristmas Eve.

[17]\n\nWe have thoroughly perused the records of this case, and \nnowhere do\n we find evidence to support petitionersâ claim that the victim was so \nengrossed in thinking about Noche Buena while \ncrossing a busy street. Petitionersâ stance regarding the victimâs \nalleged negligence is non sequitur .\n It simply does not follow that one who is run over by a vehicle on \nChristmas Eve (or any other holiday for that matter) is negligent \nbecause his thoughts were on the holiday festivities.\n\nInstead, the records support private respondentsâ claim that \nthe \nMMTC bus was being driven carelessly. As found by the trial court and \naffirmed by the Court of Appeals, the victim and her companions were \nstanding on the island of Andrew Avenue, waiting for the traffic light \nto change so they could cross. Upon seeing the red light, the victim and\n her companions started to cross. It was then when petitioner Ajoc, who \nwas trying to beat the red light, hit the victim. As the court a quo \nnoted, Ajocâs claim that âhe failed to see the victim and her companions\n proves his recklessness and lack of caution in driving his \nvehicle.â [18] Findings of fact of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the \nCourt of Appeals, are binding and conclusive on the Supreme \nCourt. [19] More so, as in this case, where petitioners have not adequately shown \nthat the courts below overlooked or disregarded certain facts or \ncircumstances of such import as would have altered the outcome of the \ncase. Contrary to petitionersâ insistence, the applicable law in this \ncase is Article 2176 of the Civil Code and not Article 2179.\n\nPetitioner MMTC next contends that the Court of Appeals erred\n in \nfinding it solidarily liable for damages with its driver/employee, Ajoc,\n pursuant to the relevant paragraphs of Article 2180 [20] of the Civil Code. It argues that the act of Ajoc in bringing the \nvictim to a hospital reflects MMTCâs diligence in the selection and \nsupervision of its drivers, particularly with regard to safety measures.\n Hence, having exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in \nthe selection and supervision of its employees to prevent damage, MMTC \nshould not be held vicariously liable.\n\nIt should be stressed, however, that whenever an employeeâs \nnegligence causes damage or injury to another, there instantly arises a \npresumption juris tantum that there was negligence \non the part \nof the employer, either in the selection of the employee (culpa in \neligiendo) or the supervision over him after the selection (culpa in \nvigilando). [21] Hence, to \nescape solidary liability for a quasi-delict committed by his employee, \nan employer must rebut the presumption by presenting convincing proof \nthat in the selection and supervision of his employee, he has exercised \nthe care and diligence of a good father of a family. [22] In the present case, \npetitioner MMTC failed to rebut the presumption of negligence on its \npart.\n\nThe claim that Ajocâs act of bringing the victim to the \nnearest \nmedical facility shows adequate supervision by MMTC over its employees \ndeserves but scant consideration. For one, the act was after the fact of\n negligence on Ajocâs part. For another, the evidence on record shows \nthat Ajocâs act was neither voluntary nor spontaneous; he had to be \nprevailed upon by the victimâs companions to render assistance to his \nvictim. [23] Moreover, the \nevidence to show that MMTC had exercised due diligence in the selection \nand supervision of its employees consisted merely of the pertinent \nguidelines for the screening and selection of its drivers, as well as \nperiodic seminars on road safety. As found by the trial court, and \naffirmed by the appellate court, petitioner MMTC failed to show that its\n driver, Ajoc, had actually undergone such screening or had attended \nsaid seminars. As previously held, â[t]he mere formulation of various \ncompany policies on safety without showing that they were being complied\n with is not sufficient to exempt (an employer) from liability arising \nfrom negligence of its employees. It is incumbent upon petitioner to \nshow that in recruiting and employing the erring driver the recruitment \nprocedures and company policies on efficiency and safety were \nfollowed.â [24] In this case, MMTC has made no satisfactory showing that it had paid \nmore than lip service to its guidelines and policies in hiring and \nsupervision. Its failure to do so cannot but warrant the proper \nsanctions from this Court, considering that MMTC is a government-owned \npublic utility organized for the public welfare. Having failed to rebut \nthe presumption of negligence on its part, MMTC is primarily and \ndirectly liable for the damages caused by its employee, the erring \ndriver, Ajoc, pursuant to Article 2180 of the Civil Code, which provides\n as follows:\n\nART. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is \ndemandable \nnot only for oneâs own acts or omissions-, but also for those of persons\n for whom one is responsible.\n\nThe father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the \nmother, \nare responsible for the damages caused by the minor children who live in\n their company.\n\nGuardians are liable for damages caused by the minors or \nincapacitated persons who are under their authority and live in their \ncompany.\n\nThe owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise \nare \nlikewise responsible for damages caused by their employees in the \nservice of the branches in which the latter are employed or on the \noccasion of their functions.\n\nEmployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their \nemployees and household helpers acting within the scope of their \nassigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business \nor industry.\n\nThe State is responsible in like manner when it acts \nthrough a \nspecial agent; but not when the damage has been caused by the official \nto whom the task done properly pertains, in which case what is provided \nin Article 2176 shall be applicable.\n\nLastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and \ntrades \nshall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or \napprentices, so long as they remain in their custody.\n\nThe responsibility treated of in this article shall cease \nwhen \nthe persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence \nof a good father of a family to prevent damage.\n\nThe owners of public utilities fall within the scope of this \narticle. [25] As earlier stated, MMTC is a public utility, organized and owned by the\n government for public transport service. Hence, its liability to \nprivate respondents, for the negligent and reckless acts of its driver, \nAjoc, under Article 2180 of the Civil Code is both manifest and clear.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition \nis DISMISSED.
