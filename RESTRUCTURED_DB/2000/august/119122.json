  "title": "PHILIPPINE BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, COURT OF TAX APPEALS, AND COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N PURISIMA, J.: At bar is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking a review of the decision[1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 34095 which affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in C.T.A. Case No. 4419. The facts that matter are as follows: On June 21, 1989, the petitioner received an assessment letter from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (respondent Commissioner) for the payment of deficiency amusement tax computed thus: Deficiency Amusement Tax Total gross receipts 1987 P19,970,928.00 15% tax due thereon 2,995,639.20 Less: Tax paid __602,063.35 Deficiency amusement tax P 2,393,575.85 Add:....75% surcharge 1,795,181.89 20% interest (2 years) 1,675,503.10 Total Amount Due & Collectible P 5,864,260.84 On July 18, 1989, petitioner contested the assessment by filing a protest with respondent Commissioner who denied the same on November 6, 1989. On January 8, 1990, petitioner filed a petition for review[2] with the Court of Tax Appeals (respondent CTA) questioning the denial by respondent Commissioner of its tax protest. On December 24, 1993, respondent CTA dismissed petitionerâs petition, holding: \"WHEREFORE, in all the foregoing, herein petition for review is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit and the Petitioner is hereby ORDERED to PAY to the Respondent the amount of P5,864,260.84 as deficiency amusement tax for the year 1987 plus 20% annual delinquency interest from July 22, 1989 which is the due date appearing on the notice and demand of the Commissioner (i.e. 30 days from receipt of the assessment) until fully paid pursuant to the provisions of Sections 248 and 249 (c) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended.\"[3] Petitioner presented a motion for reconsideration[4] of the said decision but the same was denied by respondent CTA in a resolution[5] dated April 8, 1994. Thereafter and within the reglementary period for interposing appeals, petitioner appealed the CTA decision to the Court of Appeals. On November 21, 1994, the Court of Appeals rendered its questioned Decision,[6] affirming the decision of the CTA and dismissing petitionerâs appeal. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of said decision but to no avail. The same was denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution[7] dated January 31, 1995. Hence, this petition. Undaunted, petitioner found its way to this Court via the present petition, contending that: \"1. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the jurisdiction to collect amusement taxes of PBA games is vested in the national government to the exclusion of the local governments. \"2. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that Section 13 of the Local Tax Code of 1973 limits local government units to theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement in the collection of the amusement tax. \"3. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that Revenue Regulations No. 8-88 dated February 19, 1988 is an erroneous interpretation of law. \"4. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in giving retroactive effect to the revocation of Revenue Regulations 8-88. \"5. Respondent Court of Appeals erred when it failed to consider the provisions of P.D. 851 the franchise of Petitioner, Section 8 of which provides that amusement tax on admission receipts of Petitioner is 5%. \"6. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the cession of advertising and streamer spaces in the venue to a third person is subject to amusement taxes. \"7. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the cession of advertising and streamer spaces inside the venue is embraced within the term âgross receiptsâ as defined in Section 123 (6) of the Tax Code. \"8. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the amusement tax liability of Petitioner is subject to a 75% surcharge.\" The issues for resolution in this case may be simplified as follows: Is the amusement tax on admission tickets to PBA games a national or local tax? Otherwise put, who between the national government and local government should petitioner pay amusement taxes? Is the cession of advertising and streamer spaces to Vintage Enterprises, Inc. (VEI) subject to the payment of amusement tax? If ever petitioner is liable for the payment of deficiency amusement tax, is it liable to pay a seventy-five percent (75%) surcharge on the deficiency amount due? Petitioner contends that PD 231, otherwise known as the Local Tax Code of 1973, transferred the power and authority to levy and collect amusement taxes from the sale of admission tickets to places of amusement from the national government to the local governments. Petitioner cited BIR Memorandum Circular No. 49-73 providing that the power to levy and collect amusement tax on admission tickets was transferred to the local governments by virtue of the Local Tax Code; and BIR Ruling No. 231-86 which held that \"the jurisdiction to levy amusement tax on gross receipts from admission tickets to places of amusement was transferred to local governments under P.D. No. 231, as amended.\"[8] Further, petitioner opined that even assuming arguendo that respondent Commissioner revoked BIR Ruling No. 231-86, the reversal, modification or revocation cannot be given retroactive effect since even as late as 1988 (BIR Memorandum Circular No. 8-88), respondent Commissioner still recognized the jurisdiction of local governments to collect amusement taxes. The Court is not persuaded by petitionerâs asseverations. The laws on the matter are succinct and clear and need no elaborate disquisition. Section 13 of the Local Tax Code provides: \"Sec. 13. Amusement tax on admission. -The province shall impose a tax on admission to be collected from the proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement xxx.\" The foregoing provision of law in point indicates that the province can only impose a tax on admission from the proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement. The authority to tax professional basketball games is not therein included, as the same is expressly embraced in PD 1959, which amended PD 1456 thus: \"SEC. 44. Section 268 of this Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: âSec. 268. Amusement taxes. -- There shall be collected from the proprietor, lessee or operator of cockpits, cabarets, night or day clubs, boxing exhibitions, professional basketball games, Jai-Alai, race tracks and bowling alleys, a tax equivalent to: â1. Eighteen per centum in the case of cockpits; â2. Eighteen per centum in the case of cabarets, night or day clubs; â3. Fifteen per centum in the case of boxing exhibitions; â4. Fifteen per centum in the case of professional basketball games as envisioned in Presidential Decree No. 871. Provided, however, That the tax herein shall be in lieu of all other percentage taxes of whatever nature and description; â5. Thirty per centum in the case of Jai-Alai and race tracks; and â6. Fifteen per centum in the case of bowling alleys of their gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any amount is charged or paid for admission. For the purpose of the amusement tax, the term gross receiptsâ embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement place. Said gross receipts also include income from television, radio and motion picture rights, if any. (A person or entity or association conducting any activity subject to the tax herein imposed shall be similarly liable for said tax with respect to such portion of the receipts derived by him or it.) âThe taxes imposed herein shall be payable at the end of each quarter and it shall be the duty of the proprietor, lessee, or operator concerned, as well as any party liable, within twenty days after the end of each quarter, to make a true and complete return of the amount of the gross receipts derived during the preceding quarter and pay the tax due thereon. If the tax is not paid within the time prescribed above, the amount of the tax shall be increased by twenty-five per centum, the increment to be part of the tax. âIn case of willful neglect to file the return within the period prescribed herein, or in case a false or fraudulent return is willfully made, there shall be added to the tax or to the deficiency tax, in case any payment has been made on the basis of the return before the discovery of the falsity or fraud, a surcharge of fifty per centum of its amount. The amount so added to any tax shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner and as part of the tax unless the tax has been paid before the discovery of the falsity or fraud, in which case, the amount so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as the tax.\" (underscoring ours) From the foregoing it is clear that the \"proprietor, lessee or operator of xxx professional basketball games\" is required to pay an amusement tax equivalent to fifteen per centum (15%) of their gross receipts to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which payment is a national tax. The said payment of amusement tax is in lieu of all other percentage taxes of whatever nature and description. While Section 13 of the Local Tax Code mentions \"other places of amusement\", professional basketball games are definitely not within its scope. Under the principle of ejusdem generis, where general words follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a particular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned.[9] Thus, in determining the meaning of the phrase \"other places of amusement\", one must refer to the prior enumeration of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls and circuses with artistic expression as their common characteristic. Professional basketball games do not fall under the same category as theaters, cinematographs, concert halls and circuses as the latter basically belong to artistic forms of entertainment while the former caters to sports and gaming. A historical analysis of pertinent laws does reveal the legislative intent to place professional basketball games within the ambit of a national tax. The Local Tax Code, which became effective on June 28, 1973, allowed the province to collect a tax on admission from the proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement. On January 6, 1976, the operation of petitioner was placed under the supervision and regulation of the Games and Amusement Board by virtue of PD 871, with the proviso (Section 8) that \"xxx all professional basketball games conducted by the Philippine Basketball Association shall only be subject to amusement tax of five per cent of the gross receipts from the sale of admission tickets.\" Then, on June 11, 1978, PD 1456 came into effect, increasing the amusement tax to ten per cent, with a categorical referral to PD 871, to wit, \"[t]en per centum in the case of professional basketball games as envisioned in Presidential Decree No. 871 xxx.\" Later in 1984, PD 1959 increased the rate of amusement tax to fifteen percent by making reference also to PD 871. With the reference to PD 871 by PD 1456 and PD 1959, there is a recognition under the laws of this country that the amusement tax on professional basketball games is a national, and not a local, tax. Even up to the present, the category of amusement taxes on professional basketball games as a national tax remains the same. This is so provided under Section 125[10] of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code. Section 140[11] of the Local Government Code of 1992 (Republic Act 7160), meanwhile, retained the areas (theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement) where the province may levy an amusement tax without including therein professional basketball games. Likewise erroneous is the stance of petitioner that respondent Commissionerâs issuance of BIR Ruling No. 231-86[12] and BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 8-88[13] -- both upholding the authority of the local government to collect amusement taxes -- should bind the government or that, if there is any revocation or modification of said rule, the same should operate prospectively. It bears stressing that the government can never be in estoppel, particularly in matters involving taxes. It is a well-known rule that erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do not preclude subsequent correct application of the statute, and that the Government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its agents.[14] Untenable is the contention that income from the cession of streamer and advertising spaces to VEI is not subject to amusement tax. The questioned proviso may be found in Section 1 of PD 1456 which states: \"SECTION 1. Section 268 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: âSec. 268. Amusement taxes. -- There shall be collected from the proprietor, lessee or operator of cockpits, cabarets, night or day clubs, boxing exhibitions, professional basketball games, Jai-Alai, race tracks and bowling alleys, a tax equivalent to: xxx xxx xxx of their gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any amount is charged or paid for admission. For the purpose of the amusement tax, the term gross receiptsâ embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement place. Said gross receipts also include income from television, radio and motion picture rights, if any. (A person, or entity or association conducting any activity subject to the tax herein imposed shall be similarly liable for said tax with respect to such portion of the receipts derived by him or it.)\" (underscoring ours) The foregoing definition of gross receipts is broad enough to embrace the cession of advertising and streamer spaces as the same embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement place. The law being clear, there is no need for an extended interpretation.[15] The last issue for resolution concerns the liability of petitioner for the payment of surcharge and interest on the deficiency amount due. Petitioner contends that it is not liable, as it acted in good faith, having relied upon the issuances of the respondent Commissioner. This issue must necessarily fail as the same has never been posed as an issue before the respondent court. Issues not raised in the court a quo cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.[16] All things studiedly considered, the Court rules that the petitioner is liable to pay amusement tax to the national government, and not to the local government, in accordance with the rates prescribed by PD 1959.

The amount so added to any tax shall be collected at the\n same time and in the same manner and as part of the tax unless the tax \nhas been paid before the discovery of the falsity or fraud, in which \ncase, the amount so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as \nthe tax.\" (underscoring ours)\n\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that the \"proprietor, lessee or \noperator of xxx professional basketball games\" is required to pay an \namusement tax equivalent to fifteen per centum (15%) of their gross \nreceipts to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which payment is a national \ntax. The said payment of amusement tax is in lieu of all other \npercentage taxes of whatever nature and description.\n\nWhile Section 13 of the Local Tax Code mentions \"other places of \namusement\", professional basketball games are definitely not within its \nscope. Under the principle of ejusdem generis , where general \nwords follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a \nparticular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be \nconstrued in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to\n persons or things of the same kind or class as those specifically \nmentioned. [9] Thus, in \ndetermining the meaning of the phrase \"other places of amusement\", one \nmust refer to the prior enumeration of theaters, cinematographs, concert\n halls and circuses with artistic expression as their common \ncharacteristic. Professional basketball games do not fall under the same\n category as theaters, cinematographs, concert halls and circuses as the\n latter basically belong to artistic forms of entertainment while the \nformer caters to sports and gaming.\n\nA historical analysis of pertinent laws does reveal the \nlegislative intent to place professional basketball games within the \nambit of a national tax. The Local Tax Code, which became effective on \nJune 28, 1973, allowed the province to collect a tax on admission from \nthe proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement .\n On January 6, 1976, the operation of petitioner was placed under the \nsupervision and regulation of the Games and Amusement Board by virtue of\n PD 871, with the proviso (Section 8) that \"xxx all professional \nbasketball games conducted by the Philippine Basketball Association \nshall only be subject to amusement tax of five per cent of the gross \nreceipts from the sale of admission tickets.\" Then, on June 11, 1978, PD\n 1456 came into effect, increasing the amusement tax to ten per cent, \nwith a categorical referral to PD 871, to wit, \"[t]en per centum in the \ncase of professional basketball games as envisioned in Presidential \nDecree No. 871 xxx.\" Later in 1984, PD 1959 increased the rate of \namusement tax to fifteen percent by making reference also to PD 871. \nWith the reference to PD 871 by PD 1456 and PD 1959, there is a \nrecognition under the laws of this country that the amusement tax on \nprofessional basketball games is a national, and not a local, tax. Even \nup to the present, the category of amusement taxes on professional \nbasketball games as a national tax remains the same. This is so provided\n under Section 125 [10] of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code. Section 140 [11] of the Local Government Code of 1992 (Republic Act 7160), meanwhile, \nretained the areas (theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses \nand other places of amusement) where the province may levy an amusement \ntax without including therein professional basketball games.\n\nLikewise erroneous is the stance of petitioner that respondent Commissionerâs issuance of BIR Ruling No. 231-86 [12] and BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 8-88 [13] -- both upholding the authority of the local government to collect \namusement taxes -- should bind the government or that, if there is any \nrevocation or modification of said rule, the same should operate \nprospectively.\n\nIt bears stressing that the government can never be in estoppel, \nparticularly in matters involving taxes. It is a well-known rule that \nerroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do \nnot preclude subsequent correct application of the statute, and that the\n Government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its \nagents. [14]\n\nUntenable is the contention that income from the cession of \nstreamer and advertising spaces to VEI is not subject to amusement tax. \nThe questioned proviso may be found in Section 1 of PD 1456 which \nstates:\n\n\"SECTION 1. Section 268 of the National Internal Revenue Code of \n1977, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:\n\nâSec. 268. Amusement taxes. -- There shall be collected from the \nproprietor, lessee or operator of cockpits, cabarets, night or day \nclubs, boxing exhibitions, professional basketball games, Jai-Alai, race\n tracks and bowling alleys, a tax equivalent to:\n\nxxx  xxx  xxx\n\nof their gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any amount is charged or paid for admission. For\n the purpose of the amusement tax, the term gross receiptsâ embraces all\n the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement \nplace . Said gross receipts also include income from television, \nradio and motion picture rights, if any. (A person, or entity or \nassociation conducting any activity subject to the tax herein imposed \nshall be similarly liable for said tax with respect to such portion of \nthe receipts derived by him or it.)\" (underscoring ours)\n\nThe foregoing definition of gross receipts is broad enough to embrace\n the cession of advertising and streamer spaces as the same embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement \nplace. The law being clear, there is no need for an extended \ninterpretation. [15]\n\nThe last issue for resolution concerns the liability of \npetitioner for the payment of surcharge and interest on the deficiency \namount due. Petitioner contends that it is not liable, as it acted in \ngood faith, having relied upon the issuances of the respondent \nCommissioner. This issue must necessarily fail as the same has never \nbeen posed as an issue before the respondent court. Issues not raised in\n the court a quo cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. [16]\n\nAll things studiedly considered, the Court rules that the \npetitioner is liable to pay amusement tax to the national government, \nand not to the local government, in accordance with the rates prescribed\n by PD 1959.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Petition is DENIED, and the \nDecisions of the Court of Appeals and Court of Tax Appeals dated \nNovember 21, 1994 and December 24, 1993, respectively AFFIRMED.
