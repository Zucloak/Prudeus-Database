  "title": "NICOLAS B. GARCIA, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND ROGER R. SAN LUIS, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N DE LEON, JR., J.: On July 30, 1997, private respondent Roger R. San Luis, claiming to be the owner of parcel of land, with an area of 49,998 square meters, described in Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. M-4289 of the Registry of Deeds of Rizal and located in Barangay Sampaloc, Tanay, Rizal, filed a complaint for forcible entry against petitioner Nicolas Garcia before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Tanay, Rizal, docketed as Civil Case No. 1117. On November 20, 1997, the MTC of Tanay rendered its decision in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant (petitioner herein), the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered: 1. Ordering the defendant and all persons claiming rights under him to immediately vacate the subject property and surrender possession thereof to plaintiff [private respondent herein]; 2. Ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff: P5,000.00 as monthly rental for the use if the property from March 1997 until he and all persons claiming rights under him shall have vacated the same; P30,000.00 as attorney's fees; Cost of suit. SO ORDERED.[1] In order to stay the immediate execution of the decision, petitioner perfected an appeal therefrom to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Morong, Rizal, Branch 80, and posted a supersedeas bond for the payment of rents, damages and costs from the time of the rendition of the said decision. Petitioner also periodically deposited with the said RTC rentals for the use and occupancy of the subject property during the pendency of the appeal. In its decision dated May 8, 1998 in Civil Case No. 973-M entitled: \"Roger S. San Luis v. Nicolas B. Garcia,\" the RTC of Morong, Rizal, affirmed the decision of the MTC. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the RTC. Petitioner then further elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals by means of a petition for review. The appellate court, however, denied the petition and affirmed the decision of the RTC; and subsequently it also denied the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner. On October 4, 1999, petitioner filed with this Court a petition denominated as a petition for certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the decision of the Court of Appeals and seeking reversal thereof. On October 7, 1999, petitioner filed a supplemental petition. In the Resolution dated October 13, 1999, the First Division of this Court ordered private respondent to comment on the petition and granted petitioner's prayer for a temporary restraining order to enjoin enforcement of the Writ of Execution dated September 27, 1999 and Notice to Vacate dated September 28, 1999 issued in Civil Case No. 973-M.[2] On April 28, 2000, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of and Judgment on Compromise Agreement, manifesting, among others, that: Instead of seeking further, remedies under the law to enforce their respective claims over the subject property, the parties have decided to meet half way and conclude a compromise agreement wherein their opposing interests will be threshed out and finally settled. That settlement is now embodied in a duly executed Memorandum of Agreement x x x. Accordingly, in view of the foregoing development, justice and equity dictate that any money deposited by the petitioner for purposes of the stay of execution, in the form of supersedeas bond and the monthly rentals be ordered released to the petitioner, allowing him and/or any of his representative to withdraw and duly receive the same.[3] The said Memorandum of Agreement, dated April 24, 2000, submitted by the parties for approval by this Court reads as follows: MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: This Memorandum of Agreement entered into this April 24, 2000 by and between: TERESITA A.
