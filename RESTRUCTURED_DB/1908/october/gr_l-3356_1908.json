It is similar to the case of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church vs. The Municipalities of the Province of Tarlac (9 Phil. Rep., 450).\n\nMUNICIPALITY OF LANGARAN\n\nIt is hereby adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff church is the owner and is entitled to the immediate possession of the following-described property situated in the municipality of Langaran in the Province of Misamis, to wit \n\nA church, a convent, a cemetery, and a\n\nplaza\n\nknown as the church, convent, cemetery, and\n\nplaza\n\nof Langaran, and the chapels known as\n\nvisitas\n\nof Baliangao, Monella, and Biaton \n\nand that neither the said municipality, nor the defendant Gregorio Aglipay, as\n\nObispo Maximo\n\nof the Independent Filipino Church, nor Jose de Luna has any right, title, or interest therein.\n\nIt is further adjudged and decreed that the property last hereinbefore mentioned be returned to the plaintiffs and that the said defendants be ousted from the possession thereof, and that such possession be awarded to the plaintiffs.\n\nIt is further adjudged and decreed that a writ of possession issue out of this court against the defendants, the municipality of Langaran, Gregorio Aglipay,\n\nObispo Maximo\n\nof the Independent Filipino Church, and Jose de Luna in the manner and form prescribed by Act No. 190.\n\nMUNICIPALITY OF CAGAYAN.\n\nAmong the properties described in the complaint as situated in the municipality of Cagayan is a tract of land in the barrio of Molugan. This tract of land contains cocoanut trees, and the evidence is that from that coconuts was obtained oil which was used in the church.\n\nOur jurisdiction in this class of cases is limited to churches, convents, and cemeteries, and the real and personal property used in connection therewith. We do not think that the evidence in this case shows that this tract of land is used in connection with the church. It must, therefore, be eliminated from the complaint, as we have no jurisdiction to determine the questions between the parties relating thereto. (Roman Catholic Church\n\nvs.\n\nMunicipalities of Oriental Negros, 9 Phil. Rep., 691; Roman Catholic Church\n\nvs.\n\nMunicipalities of Iloilo, 10 Phil.
