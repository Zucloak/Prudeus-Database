Nos. 139346-50, July 11, 2002 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. JOSE ABADIES Y CLAVERIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. JOSE ABADIES Y CLAVERIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPUNO, J.:\n\nThis is an\nappeal from the decision [1] of the\nRegional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna, in Criminal Case Nos. 0658-SPL to\n0661-SPL, dated May 26, 1999, finding accused-appellant Jose Abadies guilty\nbeyond reasonable doubt of four counts of violation of Republic Act No. 7610 or\nthe \"Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and\nDiscrimination Act,\" penalized under Section 5 (b), Article III and\nSection 31, Article XII thereof, and sentencing him for each count to suffer\nthe penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay a fine of P 30,000.00.\n\nAccused-appellant\nAbadies was charged with a violation of Republic Act No. 7610 in five separate\nInformations [2] which,\nexcept for the dates of commission, are similarly worded as follows: âThat on or about July 1, 1997, in\nthe Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the\njurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused actuated by lewd design did\nthen and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with force and\nintimidation commit acts of lasciviousness upon the person of his 17-year old\ndaughter ROSALIE ABADIES Y MANUNGHAYA by kissing, mashing her breast and\ntouching her private parts against her will and consent. CONTRARY TO LAW.â\n\nThe other\nincidents were allegedly committed on July 2, 3, 7 and 26, 1997. In an Order [3] dated\nJuly 16, 1998, the trial court, upon motion of the public prosecutor, dismissed\nCriminal Case No. 0657-SPL on the ground that the crime charged appears to have\nbeen committed in Las PiÃ±as City, hence, outside the territorial jurisdiction\nof the court.\n\nDuring the\narraignment, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty and hence, trial\nensued.\n\nThe facts show\nthat accused-appellant has been living for the past twenty years with his\ncommon-law wife, Catalina Manunghaya, at Bgy. Pulo, Landayan, San Pedro,\nLaguna, together with their two children, Jonathan and complainant\nRosalie. The family sleeps together in\none room and usually Catalina wakes up early in the morning to buy bread. It was during these short periods of time\nwhile Catalina was out of the house that the abuses took place. On the dates material to these cases,\ncomplainant was 17 years old, having been born on July 29, 1980. [4]\n\nComplainant\ntestified that on July 1, 1997, at about 6:00 a.m., she was sleeping in their\nhouse when she was awakened by somebody touching her breast and other private\nparts of her body. She was startled to\nsee her father, accused-appellant, and she covered her breast with a\npillow. Complainant struggled with\naccused-appellant as he persisted in mashing her breast. She could not shout as fear overcame her\nwhen she saw anger from accused-appellantâs face. Accused-appellant was forced to stop only when complainant's\nmother arrived from the store. Complainant did not tell her mother about the incident for fear of\naccused-appellant.\n\nThe following\nday, July 2, 1997, at about the same time, complainant was again jolted from\nher sleep by accused-appellant who was touching her breast. She covered herself with a blanket and with\nher hands. She fought accused-appellant\nwhen he tried to remove her hands. Again, accused-appellant desisted only when complainant's mother arrived\nfrom the store. Complainant ran to the\nbathroom where she shed tears.\n\nThe next day,\nJuly 3, 1997, complainant was once more roused from her sleep by\naccused-appellant mashing her breast. She started to cry and asked accused-appellant why he was abusing\nher. Accused-appellant simply continued\ntouching her. Again, he stopped only\nwhen his wife arrived from the store.\n\nComplainant was\nagain awakened in the early morning of July 7, 1997 by accused-appellant\ntouching her breast. This time,\naccused-appellant straddled her, inserted his hand inside her shorts and\ntouched her private part. Complainant\nresisted and removed accused-appellantâs hand. She reached out for the blanket of her brother, Jonathan, who was\nsleeping beside her in a bid to wake him up. When accused-appellant saw that Jonathan was about to turn, he stopped. However, he warned complainant not to tell\nher mother about the incident.\n\nOn July 26,\n1997, complainant was brought by accused-appellant to the house of her\nstepsister in Las PiÃ±as. Nobody was in\nthe house and strangely, accused-appellant started to sharpen his sickle. He ordered complainant to write a letter to her\nmother and revealed that he was planning to kill himself and complainant. When complainant refused, accused-appellant\nforced her inside the bedroom where he threatened complainant to choose whether\nhe would kill her or rape her. Accused-appellant started kissing complainant but the latter was able to\nrun away from him. Complainant reached\ntheir house and saw her mother. Crying\nand looking very pale, she narrated to her mother her ordeal. She likewise disclosed the past abuses of\naccused-appellant. Complainant and her\nmother then proceeded to the barangay office where they made a report. On the strength of their complaint,\naccused-appellant was arrested.\n\nComplainant\nfurther testified that on December 6, 1997, accused-appellant wrote her a\nletter from his detention cell asking for forgiveness.\n\nAccused-appellant\nproffered the defense of denial and alibi. He denies having committed acts of lasciviousness against\ncomplainant. He testified that on the\ndates of the alleged incidents, he woke up between 7:00 to 7:30 a.m.; that\ncomplainant and her mother were already preparing breakfast; and after eating\nbreakfast, he would leave for work. He\nalso testified on the reason why the charges at bar were filed against him. Allegedly, on July 26, 1997, he asked\ncomplainant what was happening to their lives as his children were aloof with\nhim. Complainant threatened to end her\nlife because she felt she was to be blamed for their problems. Accused-appellant also declared he was too\nstrict with his children, and even inflicts physical harm on them when they\ndisobey him.\n\nIn the present\nappeal, accused-appellant asserts that the court a quo erred in finding the\nprosecution's version more credible and in convicting him despite the implied\npardon given by complainant. Accused-appellant likewise contends that there exists no factual basis\nfor the trial court to consider his plea of forgiveness in his letter to\ncomplainant as an implied admission of guilt.\n\nThe appeal is\nnot impressed with merit.\n\nAccused-appellant\nstands charged with violation of Republic Act No. 7610 or The Special\nProtection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination\nAct, specifically Article III, Section 5 (b) thereof which reads: âSEC. 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. - Children, whether male or female, who for\nmoney, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence\nof any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious\nconduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual\nabuse. The penalty of reclusion\ntemporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed\nupon the following:\n\nx x x x x x x x x (b) Those\nwho commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child\nexploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; x x x.â\n\nThe elements of\nthe crime of acts of lasciviousness are: (1) that the offender commits any act\nof lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) that it is done (a) by using force or\nintimidation or (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise\nunconscious, or (c) when the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (3)\nthat the offended party is another person of either sex. [5]\n\nThe testimony of\ncomplainant that accused-appellant touched and mashed her breasts and other\nprivate parts of her body against her will, and that she could not shout or\nfight back because she was afraid of accused-appellant, sufficiently constitute\nacts of lasciviousness under the foregoing provision. Although accused-appellant was not armed nor did he threaten\ncomplainant, his moral ascendancy over her is a sufficient substitute for the\nuse of force or intimidation. [6]\n\nAccused-appellant\nfaults the trial court in giving credence to the testimony of complainant. He contends that it is difficult to\ncomprehend why complainant did not shout or do anything to ask help from her\nbrother who was sleeping beside her. He\nalso claims that if the charges were true, it is inconceivable why complainant\ndid not immediately tell her mother. The argument is specious.\n\nThe Court has\nprobed into the records to assess complainant's credibility and we find that\nher testimony deserves full faith and credit. Complainant's testimony was straightforward and free from contradiction\nas to any material point. We also\naccord great weight to the findings of the trial court having heard the\nwitnesses and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during trial. [7]\n\nComplainant's\nfailure to disclose about her misfortune to her mother does not destroy her\ncredibility. Complainant explained that\nshe did not tell her mother about her ordeal because she was afraid of\naccused-appellant. Accused-appellant\nadmitted that his children were afraid of him because he was very strict with\nthem, and that there were occasions when he would hit them with anything that\nhe could get hold of or inflict physical punishment whenever they disobeyed\nhim. [8] This is\nenough reason for complainant to be cowed into silence.\n\nIt is of no\nmoment that complainant failed to shout for help while she was being molested\nwith her brother sleeping beside her in the same room. Accused-appellant was complainantâs own\nfather, who exercised moral ascendancy over her. [9] Indeed,\nit is now hoary jurisprudence that lust is no respecter of time and place for\nrape has been committed in places where people congregate, even in the same\nroom where other members of the family are sleeping. [10] Moreover,\nwe have also ruled that no standard form of behavior has been observed when a\nperson is confronted by a shocking or a harrowing and unexpected incident, for\nthe workings of the human mind, when placed under emotional stress, are\nunpredictable. Some people may cry out,\nsome may faint, some may be shocked into insensibility, while others may yet\nappear to yield to the intrusion. [11]\n\nOn the other\nhand, accused-appellant's simple denial of the crime charged is inherently\nweak. It is negative evidence which\ncannot overcome the positive testimonies of credible witnesses. For accused-appellantâs denial to prevail,\nit must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability and there is none. [12]\n\nAccused-appellant\nfurther contends that there is no factual basis for the trial court to conclude\nthat the plea for forgiveness contained in his letter is to be deemed as an implied\nadmission of guilt. We do not agree.\n\nA cursory\nreading of the relevant parts of the letter will readily show that\naccused-appellant was indeed seeking pardon for his misdeeds. Some of the pertinent portions read as\nfollows: \" I made this letter to ask your 'forgiveness.â x x x Alam mo bang sobra-sobra na ang pagsisisi ko sa ginawa kong iyon. x x x Parang awa mo na Ne hirap na hirap na ako at ang lahat ay buong puso ko\nng pinagsisisihan. Patawarin mo na ako\nanak. x x x.\" There is no iota\nof doubt that accused-appellant was asking forgiveness for having committed the\nacts with which he now stands charged. Settled is the rule that in criminal cases, except those involving\nquasi-offenses or those allowed by law to be settled through mutual concessions,\nan offer of compromise by the accused may be received in evidence as an implied\nadmission of guilt. [13] Evidently,\nno one would ask for forgiveness unless he had committed some wrong and a plea\nfor forgiveness may be considered as analogous to an attempt to compromise. [14] Under the\ncircumstances, accused-appellantâs plea of forgiveness should be received as an\nimplied admission of guilt.\n\nAccused-appellant\nlikewise contends that he was impliedly pardoned by the complainant. He deduced the purported implied pardon from\ncomplainantâs testimony that she did not disclose to her mother the dastardly\nacts committed by accused-appellant on July 1, 2, 3 and 7, 1997 and that she\nhad not intended to file charges against him. He alleged that the present charges were filed against him only after\nthe Las PiÃ±as incident which happened on July 26, 1997. Accused-appellant posits the thesis that the\nfailure of complainant to report the first four acts of lasciviousness is\ntantamount to an implied pardon. He\nrelies on Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code which provides: âART. 344. Prosecution of the\ncrimes of adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape and acts of\nlasciviousness.\n\nx x x x x x x x x The offenses of seduction,\nabduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon\na complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or\nguardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the\nabove named persons, as the case may be. x x x.â\n\nThe argument will\nnot hold. First, the supposed pardon\ncannot be implied from the fact that the complainant did not immediately reveal\nto her mother her defloration. As\nearlier stated, it was her fear of accused-appellant which restrained\ncomplainant from reporting the incidents to her mother. Second, Article 344 of the RPC and Section\n5, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that the pardon\nmust be express and cannot be based on hazy deduction. [15]\n\nThe imposable\npenalty prescribed under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 7610 is reclusion\ntemporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua . Section 31 (c), Article XII thereof provides\nthat the penalty in its maximum period shall be imposed when the perpetrator is\nan ascendant, parent, guardian, stepparent or collateral relative within the\nsecond degree of consanguinity or affinity. In the cases at bar, the relationship of complainant and\naccused-appellant is established by the birth certificate of complainant which\nshows that accused-appellant is her father. This relationship is further supported by the testimonies of complainant\nand her mother, as well as that of accused-appellant. Hence, the trial court did not err in appreciating the generic\naggravating circumstance of relationship and in imposing the penalty of reclusion\nperpetua for each count of lascivious conduct committed by\naccused-appellant against his daughter.\n\nIt will be noted\nthat Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 7610 provides for the penalty of\nimprisonment. Nevertheless, Section 31\n(f), Article XII (Common Penal Provisions) thereof allows the imposition of a\nfine subject to the discretion of the court, provided that the same is to be\nadministered as a cash fund by the Department of Social Welfare and Development\nand disbursed for the rehabilitation of each child victim, or any immediate\nmember of his family if the latter is the perpetrator of the offense. This provision is in accord with Article 39\nof the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild, to which the Philippines became a party on August 21, 1990, which\nstresses the duty of states parties to ensure the physical and psychological\nrecovery and social reintegration of abused and exploited children in an\nenvironment which fosters their self-respect and human dignity.\n\nIn the case of People\nvs. Jaime Cadag Jimenez [16] where a minor victim was sexually\nmolested by her own father, the accused was ordered to pay a fine of P 20,000.00\nas cash fund for the rehabilitation of the victim and moral damages in the\namount of P 50,000.00 for each count of lascivious act committed by the\naccused. Hence, in the cases at bar,\nthe trial court correctly imposed a fine of P 30,000.00 for each count of\nlascivious conduct committed by accused-appellant. In addition, moral damages should be awarded in the amount of P 50,000.00\nfor each count.\n\nAs a final note,\nwe deem it relevant to stress the escalating awareness and concern for the\nprotection of the rights of children. The need of children for special protection was given recognition by the\nnations of the world as early as 1924 when the assembly of the League of\nNations endorsed the Declaration of the Rights of the Child (commonly known as\nThe Declaration of Geneva) which focused on children's welfare, specifically\ntheir economic, psychological and social needs. Reaffirming the fact that children need special care and\nprotection because of their vulnerability, and the vital role of international\ncooperation in securing children's rights, the General Assembly of the United\nNations adopted on November 20, 1989 the Convention on the Rights of the Child\n(CRC), which incorporates the full range of human rights - civil, political,\neconomic, social and cultural - of children. The Convention stresses the duty of the state to take all the necessary\nsteps to protect children from being sexually abused (as in rape, molestation\nand incest) or exploited (forced or induced into prostitution, pornographic\nperformances and others). [17] It is\nreassuring to note that we are not lagging far behind on the domestic front. Over the past years, Congress has enacted a\nnumber of laws relating to the protection of children's welfare and rights, [18] while the\nexecutive department has issued various executive orders and proclamations in\norder to give teeth to the implementation and enforcement of these laws. [19] These\ninternational instruments and national legislation emphasize that the primodial\nconsideration in deciding issues and cases involving children is the welfare\nand best interests of the child. [20] For its\npart, the Supreme Court has issued Administrative Circular No. 23-95 enjoining\ntrial courts to act with dispatch on all cases involving children, including\nbut not limited to pedophilia, child labor and child abuse cases. To date, procedural rules applicable\nspecifically to cases involving children have already been approved by the\nCourt such as the Rules on Examination of a Child Witness, on Commitment of\nChildren, and on Juveniles in Conflict with the Law. Our duty does not end here though. As the highest court of the land, it is incumbent upon us to give\nlife to all these covenants, agreements, and statutes by enriching and\nenhancing our jurisprudence on child abuse cases, bearing in mind always the\nwelfare and protection of children.\n\nWHEREFORE , the decision of the Regional Trial\nCourt of San Pedro, Laguna, Branch 93, in Criminal Case Nos. 0658-SPL to\n0660-SPL, finding accused-appellant JOSE ABADIES guilty beyond reasonable doubt\nof four counts of violation of Republic Act No. 7610, and sentencing him to\nsuffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay a fine of P 30,000.00,\nfor each count, is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellant\nis hereby ordered to pay moral damages in the amount of P 50,000.00 for\neach count.
