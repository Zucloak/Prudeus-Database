  "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. NESTOR MATUBIS ALIAS KA SHERMA, EMILIO DELGACO ALIAS KA BOY AND JOHN DOE, DEFENDANTS. EMILIO DELGACO, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N ROMERO, J.: Once again, the Court is called upon to resolve a case arising from the senseless killing of an innocent countryside civilian by misguided elements hiding under the protective wings of the New Peopleâs Army (NPA). For the crime, Nestor Matubis alias Ka Sherma, Emilio Delgaco alias Ka Boy and an unidentified cohort were charged with murder under the following information: âThat on or about the 24th day of March, 1988, at Barangay La Purisima, Municipality of Nabua, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, who are still at large, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, armed with 38 Caliber Revolver and 45 Caliber pistol, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot one Alfonso Sales, Jr., on the different parts of his body, thereby causing direct and immediate death of the victim to the damage and prejudice of his heirs in the amount of no less than Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), Philippine Currency. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.â Alfonso Sales, Jr., a 23-year-old bachelor who took the two-year course for auto mechanic at the University of Northeastern Philippines in Iriga City, helped his parents manage the operation of four jeepneys. From time to time, he would drive one of the jeepneys for which he would receive an average commission of P100 a day out of the fares paid by passengers. He set aside a certain amount of his earnings for his personal needs and used the balance to buy food for his family in La Purisima, Nabua, Camarines Sur.[1] At about 7:00 oâclock in the evening of March 24, 1988, Sales was playing chess with Walter Lompero in front of the Breboneria Store in La Purisima. Watching the game were Teodoro Baldoza, Edgar Breboneria, Roberto Agonos, Edwin Dante and a fifth person. About thirty minutes later, four persons, who appeared to be new to the place, passed by and proceeded towards the direction of the La Purisima Elementary School. Informed by Lompero and Baldoza of the presence of these persons, Sales advised the two not to mind them. After about two minutes, Nestor Matubis approached Sales by passing by Lomperoâs left side. From a distance of one armâs length from Baldoza and three meters from Lompero, they saw Matubis shoot Sales on the temple twice. Matubis was armed with a .45 caliber pistol. Around ten meters away, Emilio Delgaco blocked the road. Lompero saw that Matubis was wearing a pair of maong pants and white T-shirt. After recovering from shock, Lompero ran towards a coconut plantation some fifteen meters away. From there, he saw Delgaco shoot Sales with a .38 caliber revolver. He clearly saw all these despite the distance, as a street light illuminated the place very well.[2] Baldoza saw Delgaco holding a .38 caliber gun, but because he ran towards the Breboneria Store to seek cover under the bed, he did not see Delgaco shoot Sales. While lying on the floor, however, he heard three more gunshots.[3] The postmortem examination conducted by Dr. Audie Margate, municipal health officer of Nabua, Camarines Sur, revealed that Sales sustained the following wounds: 1. Gunshot wound, semi-circular, at the temporal region behind the base of the left ear directed upward to the right with inverted tissues with contusion collar at the point of entry and with no point of exit. 2. Gunshot wound, semi-circular with contusion collar and inverted tissues around the point of entry at the later aspect, right eyebrow, directed downward to the left, also with no point of exit. 3. Gunshot wound, semi-circular, with contusion collar with inverted tissue at the 8th intercostal space, left posterior axillary line, likewise with no point of exit. 4. Gunshot wound with contusion collar and inverted tissue at the 4th intercostal space, right posterior axillary line, directed upward to the right. This wound was superficial and not penetrating. 5. Gunshot wound, semi-circular with inverted tissue and contusion collar, at the right posterior lumbar area, midscapular line, directed upward and with no point of exit. Dr. Margate recovered a slug embedded underneath the skin at the level of the 4th intercostal space, right anterior axillary line.[4] According to Dr. Margate, wounds 1, 2, 3 and 5 were fatal while wound 4 was not because it was only superficial and did not penetrate the body. Death was due to hypovolemic shock, secondary to hemorrhage brought about by the multiple gunshot wounds.[5] Dr. Margate turned over the slug he recovered from the body to the Nabua police. P/Cpl. Josefino O. Rebolado admitted having custody of the slug recovered from the body of the victim. He presented before the trial court said slug as well as the empty shells of bullets from the different kinds of firearms that were recovered from the crime scene.[6] According to the victimâs father, Alfonso Sales, Sr., his family spent P25,000.00 for funeral parlor services[7] as a result of the death of his son. The family spent P30,000.00 for food during the wake but there were no receipts for the latter expenses.[8] Matubis and Delgaco denied the accusation against them. Matubis admitted that he was a member of the NPA, charged with the job of lecturing to the masses. He was not issued a firearm. Instead, although he reached only first year high school, he was given a book called Pangkalahatang Kursong Masa and he lectured in Balatan from 1983 to 1986.[9] It was only in the latter year that he went to La Purisima to visit Eva Pilapil Occiano who later became his wife. In that year, he moved to Manila where he cohabited with Eva. The following year, her parents encouraged him to avail of the amnesty program of the government. Thus, when the crime transpired, he was in Manila applying for the balik-loob project for members of the NPA under the amnesty program. He was arrested on January 5, 1989 inside a jeepney in a parking area in Sta. Mesa, Manila while following up his petition for amnesty, but no warrant of arrest was shown to him. He was brought to the CAPCOM office where he was detained for three days. On January 9, 1989, he was brought to the Nabua Police Station. He claimed that he did not know any of the prosecution witnesses, as well as the victim.[10] Emilio Delgaco, 45 years of age, admitted that he had been a member of the NPA since 1986. He was given the assignment of collecting money and palay from farmers in Patag and Salvacion, Bato, Camarines Sur but since birth, he had always resided in San Vicente, Ogbon, Nabua, Camarines Sur. He knew that Madahon is adjacent to Ogbon as it could be seen from a distance and that Sto. Domingo separates Madahon from La Purisima. He learned of the latter fact only in 1989 when he passed by Sto. Domingo while he was on the way to La Purisima with Roger AcompaÃ±ado. In June, 1988, he surrendered to Cpl. Melchor Chuchi Prades in his home in San Miguel, Nabua, Camarines Sur after his brother, Elpidio, had been shot in the knee by members of the NPA. To begin a new life, he availed of the balik-loob project of the government. He denied knowing any of the prosecution witnesses nor the victim and alleged that the first time he met his co-accused, Nestor Matubis, was in the police station in Bicol. He claimed that Walter Lompero implicated him in the case after he had refused to testify against Nestor Matubis.[11] On May 24, 1990, the trial court found both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and rendered the decision[12] with the following decretal portion: âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, defined and penalized under Art. 248, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, after applying the indeterminate sentence law, the accused, NESTOR MATUBIS and EMILIO DELGACO, are each sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a period of 12 years and 1 day to 17 years, 4 months of prision mayor maximum to reclusion temporal medium in its medium period and for both accused to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of Alfonso Sales, Jr. the sum of P55,000.00, Philippine Currency and to pay the costs. SO ORDERED.â Both accused interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.[13] On July 19, 1990, the trial court ordered that the entire record of the case be forwarded to said appellate court.[14] On July 24, 1990, appellant Delgaco filed a motion to post bailbond pending appeal.[15] The trial court, having granted the motion on July 30, 1990, appellant Delgaco posted a P40,000.00 bailbond,[16] after which he was released on bail on September 8, 1990. Nestor Matubis, who likewise posted a bailbond, was also released on September 13, 1990.[17] On December 29, 1992, the Court of Appeals rendered the Decision[18] affirming the trial courtâs decision insofar as it found the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified by treachery but decreeing as follows: âPREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by finding accused-appellants Nestor Matubis âAliasâ Ka Sherma and Emilio Delgaco âAliasâ Ka Boy guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder without any mitigating or aggravating circumstance and, as a consequence, this Court hereby imposes upon each of them the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. Considering that the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua has been imposed in the instant case, the same is now certified to the Honorable Supreme Court for eview (sic). SO ORDERED.â This Court accepted the appeal on May 19, 1993. On even date, we ordered the commitment of appellants to the New Bilibid Prison.[19] As it was only appellant Delgaco who appeared and voluntarily surrendered to the Court,[20] we ordered the cancellation of the bond posted by appellant Matubis and directed the issuance of a warrant of arrest against him.[21] On February 21, 1995, Alfredo G. Memije, Chief of the PNP Criminal Investigation Command, Department of Interior and Local Government, informed this Court that the warrant of arrest against appellant Matubis could not be served as he was nowhere to be found in La Purisima, Nabua, Camarines Sur.[22] Hence, on March 13, 1995, this Court ordered the dismissal of the appeal of Matubis and the corresponding forfeiture of the bond he had posted.[23] In compliance with the Courtâs directive, counsel for appellant Delgaco filed a manifestation on August 22, 1995 that he was adopting the appellantâs brief he had filed with the Court of Appeals to avoid repetition of arguments.[24] The Court granted appellant Delgacoâs prayer on September 6, 1995.[25] In his brief, appellant Delgaco alleges that the trial court erred in: (a) finding that prosecution witnesses Lompero and Baldoza positively identified him; (b) relying on the âuncorroborated, inconsistent and unreliable statement of prosecution witnesses,â and (c) convicting him of the crime charged despite the prosecutionâs failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The pivotal issue in this appeal is one of credibility of witnesses and their testimonies. Time and again, this Court has held that it will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in determining the credibility of witnesses unless there appear on record some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which have been overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted by the same trial court. The reason behind this dictum is that the trial judge enjoys the peculiar advantage of observing directly and at first hand the witnessesâ deportment and manner of testifying. He is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions on the basis thereof.[26] The trial courtâs conclusions on the issue of credibility are in fact buttressed by the failure of the defense to attribute any false or evil motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses that could have impelled them to perjure themselves against appellant. Hence, their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.[27] We are convinced that appellant Delgaco had been positively identified as one of the persons who shot Sales. While it was only Lompero who saw appellant shoot the victim, his positive and credible testimony stands unaffected. Unless expressly required by law, the testimony of a single witness, if found credible and positive, is sufficient to convict.[28] Truth is established not by the number of witnesses but by the quality of their testimonies.[29] The Court disagrees with appellantâs contention that Lomperoâs reaction upon seeing the incident is contrary to the human instinct of self-preservation. The general or common rule is that witnesses to a crime react in different ways.[30] As this Court has held in a number of cases, witnesses of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their situation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. Witnesses to a surprising event see differently some details thereof due in large part to the excitement and confusion that it usually brings[31] and the fact that what may be rational for one may be strange to another.[32] Witness Lomperoâs having seen appellant Delgaco shoot Sales as he looked back after taking refuge in the coconut plantation some fifteen meters away[33] is not necessarily contrary to the human instinct of self-preservation. It should be observed that he first secured his safety by running towards the coconut plantation before looking back. Moreover, appellantâs argument that the same witness could not have identified him from a distance of fifteen meters considering that the incident happened at night is not tenable. In the first place, an electric street lamp lighted the place.[34] Secondly, Lompero had known appellant even before the incident because, for a period of two years, appellant and Matubis were known in the place as members of the NPA.[35] Notably, in People v. Castillo,[36] the Court held that once a person has gained familiarity with another, identification becomes quite an easy task even from a considerable distance. It is, therefore, not implausible that from a distance of fifteen meters, Lompero could have recognized and identified appellant. It was not only Lompero who established appellantâs presence in the crime scene. Witness Teodoro Baldoza also testified that he saw appellant holding a gun although he failed to see if appellant used it as, after the second shot fired by Matubis, he fled to the Briboneria store.[37] The fact that appellant was carrying a gun at the crime scene supports the testimony of Lompero that the former indeed conspiratorially participated in the killing of Sales. Thus, even assuming that Lompero failed to see appellant fire his gun at Sales, still, by his acts of carrying the gun and blocking the road,[38] a community of criminal design with Matubis to kill Sales was manifest. A person found in conspiracy with the actual perpetrator of the crime by performing specific acts with such closeness and coordination as the one who executed the criminal act is equally guilty as the latter.[39] With regard to the failure of the witnesses to immediately report the incident to the proper authorities, we hold that the delay they incurred does not affect, much less impair their credibility, because such delay was satisfactorily explained.[40] It was due to the fact that the witnesses were cowed by the reputation of the two accused who were admittedly members of the NPA,[41] on top of the fact that appellant was a resident of a nearby barangay in the same town of Nabua. As this Court has held, it is equally understandable for a witness to fear for his safety especially when town mates are involved in the commission of the crime because an inculpatory statement can easily provoke retaliation.[42] The initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer information about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in criminal investigations due to fear of reprisal is common and has been judicially declared not to affect credibility.[43] The Court finds no inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. While both Lompero and Baldoza called the attention of the victim to the presence of some four persons whom they referred to as ânew faces,â such description of appellant may be explained by the circumstances under which it was used. It is of judicial notice that in places where the NPA operates, the local folks refer euphemistically to the members of that group as ânew faces,â sometimes in fear and at other times to distinguish them from the residents of the area. There was no inconsistency between the number of wounds sustained by the victim as found by the examining physician and the testimonies of Lompero and Baldoza. Dr. Margate found five gunshot wounds. Lompero saw Matubis shoot the victim twice and, after he had fled and looked back, he saw appellant shoot the victim once.[44] On the other hand, Baldoza saw how Matubis fired the two initial gunshots and heard three more shots as he laid on the floor of the Breboneria Store.[45] Even assuming that these are inconsistencies, they do not necessarily affect the fact that the victim sustained five gunshot wounds during the incident. By the swiftness of the occurrences, it is but natural that Lompero might not have counted accurately the gunshots. The same prosecution witnessesâ failure to declare the same number of shots fired during the incident does not signify at all that they prevaricated. On the contrary, the fact that the testimonies of Lompero and Baldoza are not exactly on all fours with each other obliterates the suspicion of a rehearsed testimony. Whatever âinconsistenciesâ may seem apparent to the appellant are actually badges of truth rather than of falsehood.[46] What is important is that Lompero positively identified appellant as one of the assailants.[47] The alleged inconsistency is trivial but understandable considering the suddenness of the attack, the dreadful scene unfolding before the witnessesâ eyes, as well as the imperfection of human memory.[48] Appellantâs defenses of denial and alibi cannot prevail over their positive identification by the prosecution witnesses who had no motive to falsely testify against him.[49] Besides, appellantâs uncorroborated alibi failed to prove that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene during its commission.[50] Clearly, appellant committed the crime of murder. The killing is qualified by the proven circumstance of treachery that was manifested by the swift and unexpected attack on the unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on his part.[51] The Court of Appeals correctly imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The crime of murder is punishable by the penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death.[52] In the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the proper imposable penalty is the medium period of said penalty or reclusion perpetua.[53] WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals, finding appellant Emilio Delgaco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua that was certified to this Court for review, is hereby AFFIRMED subject to the MODIFICATION that appellant shall be civilly liable to the heirs of Alfonso Sales, Jr. in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00). Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Philippine National Police and the Department of Justice which shall cause the arrest of Nestor Matubis whose appeal has been dismissed for his failure to submit to the authority of this Court.

For the\ncrime, Nestor Matubis alias Ka Sherma , Emilio Delgaco alias Ka\nBoy and an unidentified cohort were charged with murder under the following\ninformation: âThat on\nor about the 24 th day of March, 1988, at Barangay La\nPurisima, Municipality of Nabua, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within\nthe jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, who are still at\nlarge, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, armed with\n38 Caliber Revolver and 45 Caliber pistol, with intent to kill, with treachery\nand evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously shoot one Alfonso Sales, Jr., on the different parts of his body,\nthereby causing direct and immediate death of the victim to the damage and\nprejudice of his heirs in the amount of no less than Fifty Thousand Pesos ( P 50,000.00),\nPhilippine Currency. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.â\n\nAlfonso Sales, Jr., a 23-year-old\nbachelor who took the two-year course for auto mechanic at the University of\nNortheastern Philippines in Iriga City, helped his parents manage the operation\nof four jeepneys. From time to time, he\nwould drive one of the jeepneys for which he would receive an average\ncommission of P100 a day out of the fares paid by passengers. He set aside a certain amount of his\nearnings for his personal needs and used the balance to buy food for his family\nin La Purisima, Nabua, Camarines Sur. [1]\n\nAt about 7:00 oâclock in the\nevening of March 24, 1988, Sales was playing chess with Walter Lompero in front\nof the Breboneria Store in La Purisima. Watching the game were Teodoro Baldoza,\nEdgar Breboneria, Roberto Agonos, Edwin Dante and a fifth person. About thirty minutes later, four persons,\nwho appeared to be new to the place, passed by and proceeded towards the\ndirection of the La Purisima Elementary School. Informed by Lompero and Baldoza of the presence of these persons,\nSales advised the two not to mind them.\n\nAfter about two minutes, Nestor\nMatubis approached Sales by passing by Lomperoâs left side. From a distance of one armâs length from\nBaldoza and three meters from Lompero, they saw Matubis shoot Sales on the\ntemple twice. Matubis was armed with a\n.45 caliber pistol. Around ten meters away, Emilio Delgaco blocked the\nroad. Lompero saw that Matubis was\nwearing a pair of maong pants and white T-shirt. After recovering from shock, Lompero ran\ntowards a coconut plantation some fifteen meters away. From there, he saw\nDelgaco shoot Sales with a .38 caliber revolver. He clearly saw all these despite the distance, as a street light\nilluminated the place very well. [2]\n\nBaldoza saw Delgaco holding a .38\ncaliber gun, but because he ran towards the Breboneria Store to seek cover\nunder the bed, he did not see Delgaco shoot Sales. While lying on the floor,\nhowever, he heard three more gunshots. [3]\n\nThe postmortem examination\nconducted by Dr. Audie Margate, municipal health officer of Nabua, Camarines\nSur, revealed that Sales sustained the following wounds: 1. Gunshot wound, semi-circular, at the temporal region behind the\nbase of the left ear directed upward to the right with inverted tissues with\ncontusion collar at the point of entry and with no point of exit. 2. Gunshot wound, semi-circular with contusion collar and inverted\ntissues around the point of entry at the later aspect, right eyebrow, directed\ndownward to the left, also with no point of exit. 3. Gunshot wound, semi-circular, with\ncontusion collar with inverted tissue at the 8 th intercostal space, left posterior\naxillary line, likewise with no point of exit. 4. Gunshot wound with contusion collar and\ninverted tissue at the 4 th intercostal space, right posterior axillary line, directed upward to the right.\nThis wound was superficial and not penetrating. 5. Gunshot wound, semi-circular with inverted tissue and contusion\ncollar, at the right posterior lumbar area, midscapular line, directed upward\nand with no point of exit.\n\nDr.\nMargate recovered a slug embedded underneath the skin at the level of the 4 th intercostal space, right anterior axillary line. [4]\n\nAccording to Dr. Margate, wounds\n1, 2, 3 and 5 were fatal while wound 4 was not because it was only superficial\nand did not penetrate the body. Death\nwas due to hypovolemic shock, secondary to hemorrhage brought about by the\nmultiple gunshot wounds. [5] Dr. Margate turned over the slug he recovered from\nthe body to the Nabua police.\n\nP/Cpl. Josefino O. Rebolado\nadmitted having custody of the slug recovered from the body of the victim. He presented before the trial court said\nslug as well as the empty shells of bullets from the different kinds of\nfirearms that were recovered from the crime scene. [6]\n\nAccording to the victimâs father,\nAlfonso Sales, Sr., his family spent P 25,000.00 for funeral parlor\nservices [7] as a result of the death of his son. The family\nspent P 30,000.00 for food during the wake but there were no receipts for\nthe latter expenses. [8]\n\nMatubis and Delgaco denied the\naccusation against them. Matubis\nadmitted that he was a member of the NPA, charged with the job of lecturing to\nthe masses. He was not issued a\nfirearm. Instead, although he reached\nonly first year high school, he was given a book called Pangkalahatang\nKursong Masa and he lectured in Balatan from 1983 to 1986. [9] It was only in the latter year that he went to La\nPurisima to visit Eva Pilapil Occiano who later became his wife. In that year,\nhe moved to Manila where he cohabited with Eva. The following year, her parents encouraged him to avail of the\namnesty program of the government. Thus, when the crime transpired, he was in\nManila applying for the balik-loob project for members of the NPA under\nthe amnesty program. He was arrested on\nJanuary 5, 1989 inside a jeepney in a parking area in Sta. Mesa, Manila while\nfollowing up his petition for amnesty, but no warrant of arrest was shown to\nhim. He was brought to the CAPCOM\noffice where he was detained for three days. On January 9, 1989, he was brought to the Nabua Police Station. He claimed that he did not know any of the\nprosecution witnesses, as well as the victim. [10]\n\nEmilio Delgaco, 45 years of age,\nadmitted that he had been a member of the NPA since 1986. He was given the assignment of collecting\nmoney and palay from farmers in Patag and Salvacion, Bato, Camarines Sur\nbut since birth, he had always resided in San Vicente, Ogbon, Nabua, Camarines\nSur. He knew that Madahon is adjacent\nto Ogbon as it could be seen from a distance and that Sto. Domingo separates\nMadahon from La Purisima. He learned of\nthe latter fact only in 1989 when he passed by Sto. Domingo while he was on the\nway to La Purisima with Roger AcompaÃ±ado. In June, 1988, he surrendered to Cpl. Melchor Chuchi Prades in his home\nin San Miguel, Nabua, Camarines Sur after his brother, Elpidio, had been shot\nin the knee by members of the NPA. To\nbegin a new life, he availed of the balik-loob project of the\ngovernment. He denied knowing any of\nthe prosecution witnesses nor the victim and alleged that the first time he met\nhis co-accused, Nestor Matubis, was in the police station in Bicol. He claimed that Walter Lompero implicated\nhim in the case after he had refused to testify against Nestor Matubis. [11]\n\nOn May 24, 1990, the trial court\nfound both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and\nrendered the decision [12] with the following decretal portion: âWHEREFORE, premises\nconsidered, the Court finds the accused, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the\ncrime of Murder, defined and penalized under Art. 248, par. 1 of the Revised\nPenal Code. Accordingly, after applying\nthe indeterminate sentence law, the accused, NESTOR MATUBIS and EMILIO DELGACO,\nare each sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a period of 12 years and 1 day to\n17 years, 4 months of prision mayor maximum to reclusion temporal medium in its\nmedium period and for both accused to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs\nof Alfonso Sales, Jr. the sum of P 55,000.00, Philippine Currency and to\npay the costs. SO ORDERED.â\n\nBoth accused interposed an appeal\nto the Court of Appeals. [13] On July 19, 1990, the trial court ordered that the\nentire record of the case be forwarded to said appellate court. [14] On July 24, 1990, appellant Delgaco filed a motion\nto post bailbond pending appeal. [15] The trial court, having granted the motion on July\n30, 1990, appellant Delgaco posted a P40,000.00 bailbond, [16] after which he was released on bail on September 8,\n1990. Nestor Matubis, who likewise posted a bailbond, was also released on\nSeptember 13, 1990. [17]\n\nOn December 29, 1992, the Court\nof Appeals rendered the Decision [18] affirming the trial courtâs decision insofar as it\nfound the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified\nby treachery but decreeing as follows: âPREMISES CONSIDERED, the\ndecision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by finding accused-appellants Nestor\nMatubis âAliasâ Ka Sherma and Emilio Delgaco âAliasâ Ka Boy guilty beyond\nreasonable doubt of the crime of Murder without any mitigating or aggravating\ncircumstance and, as a consequence, this Court hereby imposes upon each of them\nthe penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. Considering that the\npenalty of Reclusion Perpetua has been imposed in the instant case, the\nsame is now certified to the Honorable Supreme Court for eview (sic). SO ORDERED.â\n\nThis Court accepted the appeal on\nMay 19, 1993. On even date, we ordered\nthe commitment of appellants to the New Bilibid Prison. [19] As it was only appellant Delgaco who appeared and\nvoluntarily surrendered to the Court, [20] we ordered the cancellation of the bond posted by\nappellant Matubis and directed the issuance of a warrant of arrest against him. [21] On February 21, 1995, Alfredo G. Memije, Chief of\nthe PNP Criminal Investigation Command, Department of Interior and Local\nGovernment, informed this Court that the warrant of arrest against appellant\nMatubis could not be served as he was nowhere to be found in La Purisima,\nNabua, Camarines Sur. [22] Hence, on March 13, 1995, this Court ordered the\ndismissal of the appeal of Matubis and the corresponding forfeiture of the bond\nhe had posted. [23]\n\nIn compliance with the Courtâs\ndirective, counsel for appellant Delgaco filed a manifestation on August 22,\n1995 that he was adopting the appellantâs brief he had filed with the Court of\nAppeals to avoid repetition of arguments. [24] The Court granted appellant Delgacoâs prayer on\nSeptember 6, 1995. [25] In his brief, appellant Delgaco alleges that the\ntrial court erred in: (a) finding that prosecution witnesses Lompero and\nBaldoza positively identified him; (b) relying on the âuncorroborated,\ninconsistent and unreliable statement of prosecution witnesses,â and (c)\nconvicting him of the crime charged despite the prosecutionâs failure to prove\nhis guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe pivotal issue in this appeal\nis one of credibility of witnesses and their testimonies. Time and again, this Court has held that it\nwill not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in determining the credibility\nof witnesses unless there appear on record some facts or circumstances of\nweight and influence which have been overlooked or the significance of which\nhas been misinterpreted by the same trial court. The reason behind this dictum is that the trial judge enjoys the\npeculiar advantage of observing directly and at first hand the witnessesâ\ndeportment and manner of testifying. He\nis, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and\nconclusions on the basis thereof. [26] The trial courtâs conclusions on the issue of\ncredibility are in fact buttressed by the failure of the defense to attribute\nany false or evil motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses that could\nhave impelled them to perjure themselves against appellant. Hence, their testimonies are entitled to\nfull faith and credit. [27]\n\nWe are convinced that appellant\nDelgaco had been positively identified as one of the persons who shot\nSales. While it was only Lompero who\nsaw appellant shoot the victim, his positive and credible testimony stands unaffected. Unless expressly required by law, the\ntestimony of a single witness, if found credible and positive, is sufficient to\nconvict. [28] Truth is established not by the number of witnesses\nbut by the quality of their testimonies. [29]\n\nThe Court disagrees with\nappellantâs contention that Lomperoâs reaction upon seeing the incident is\ncontrary to the human instinct of self-preservation. The general or common rule is that witnesses to a crime react in\ndifferent ways. [30] As this Court has held in a number of cases,\nwitnesses of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their\nsituation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral\nresponse when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful\nexperience. Witnesses to a surprising\nevent see differently some details thereof due in large part to the excitement\nand confusion that it usually brings [31] and the fact that what may be rational for one may\nbe strange to another. [32]\n\nWitness Lomperoâs having seen\nappellant Delgaco shoot Sales as he looked back after taking refuge in the\ncoconut plantation some fifteen meters away [33] is not necessarily contrary to the human instinct of\nself-preservation. It should be\nobserved that he first secured his safety by running towards the coconut\nplantation before looking back. Moreover, appellantâs argument that the same witness could not have\nidentified him from a distance of fifteen meters considering that the incident\nhappened at night is not tenable. In\nthe first place, an electric street lamp lighted the place. [34] Secondly, Lompero had known appellant even before\nthe incident because, for a period of two years, appellant and Matubis were\nknown in the place as members of the NPA. [35] Notably, in People v. Castillo, [36] the Court\nheld that once a person has gained familiarity with another, identification\nbecomes quite an easy task even from a considerable distance. It is, therefore, not implausible that from\na distance of fifteen meters, Lompero could have recognized and identified\nappellant.\n\nIt was not only Lompero who\nestablished appellantâs presence in the crime scene. Witness Teodoro Baldoza\nalso testified that he saw appellant holding a gun although he failed to see if\nappellant used it as, after the second shot fired by Matubis, he fled to the\nBriboneria store. [37] The fact that appellant was carrying a gun at the\ncrime scene supports the testimony of Lompero that the former indeed\nconspiratorially participated in the killing of Sales. Thus, even assuming that\nLompero failed to see appellant fire his gun at Sales, still, by his acts of\ncarrying the gun and blocking the road, [38] a community of criminal design with Matubis to kill\nSales was manifest. A person found in\nconspiracy with the actual perpetrator of the crime by performing specific acts\nwith such closeness and coordination as the one who executed the criminal act\nis equally guilty as the latter. [39]\n\nWith regard to the failure of the\nwitnesses to immediately report the incident to the proper authorities, we hold\nthat the delay they incurred does not affect, much less impair their\ncredibility, because such delay was satisfactorily explained. [40] It was due to the fact that the witnesses were cowed\nby the reputation of the two accused who were admittedly members of the NPA, [41] on top of the fact that appellant was a resident of\na nearby barangay in the same town of Nabua. As this Court has held, it is equally understandable for a witness to\nfear for his safety especially when town mates are involved in the commission\nof the crime because an inculpatory statement can easily provoke retaliation. [42] The initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer\ninformation about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in\ncriminal investigations due to fear of reprisal is common and has been\njudicially declared not to affect credibility. [43]\n\nThe Court finds no\ninconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. While both Lompero and Baldoza called the\nattention of the victim to the presence of some four persons whom they referred\nto as ânew faces,â such description of appellant may be explained by the\ncircumstances under which it was used. It is of judicial notice that in places where the NPA operates, the\nlocal folks refer euphemistically to the members of that group as ânew faces,â\nsometimes in fear and at other times to distinguish them from the residents of\nthe area.\n\nThere was no inconsistency\nbetween the number of wounds sustained by the victim as found by the examining\nphysician and the testimonies of Lompero and Baldoza. Dr. Margate found five gunshot wounds. Lompero saw Matubis shoot the victim twice and, after he\nhad fled and looked back, he saw appellant shoot the victim once. [44] On the other hand, Baldoza saw how Matubis\nfired the two initial gunshots and heard three more shots as he laid on\nthe floor of the Breboneria Store. [45] Even assuming that these are inconsistencies, they\ndo not necessarily affect the fact that the victim sustained five gunshot\nwounds during the incident. By the\nswiftness of the occurrences, it is but natural that Lompero might not have\ncounted accurately the gunshots. The\nsame prosecution witnessesâ failure to declare the same number of shots fired\nduring the incident does not signify at all that they prevaricated. On the contrary, the fact that the\ntestimonies of Lompero and Baldoza are not exactly on all fours with each other\nobliterates the suspicion of a rehearsed testimony. Whatever âinconsistenciesâ\nmay seem apparent to the appellant are actually badges of truth rather than of\nfalsehood. [46] What is important is that Lompero positively\nidentified appellant as one of the assailants. [47] The alleged inconsistency is trivial but\nunderstandable considering the suddenness of the attack, the dreadful scene\nunfolding before the witnessesâ eyes, as well as the imperfection of human\nmemory. [48]\n\nAppellantâs defenses of denial\nand alibi cannot prevail over their positive identification by the prosecution\nwitnesses who had no motive to falsely testify against him. [49] Besides, appellantâs uncorroborated alibi failed to\nprove that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene\nduring its commission. [50]\n\nClearly, appellant committed the\ncrime of murder. The killing is\nqualified by the proven circumstance of treachery that was manifested by the\nswift and unexpected attack on the unarmed victim without the slightest\nprovocation on his part. [51]\n\nThe Court of Appeals correctly\nimposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The crime of murder is punishable by the penalty of reclusion\ntemporal in its maximum period to death. [52] In the absence of mitigating or aggravating\ncircumstances, the proper imposable penalty is the medium period of said\npenalty or reclusion perpetua. [53]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision of the Court of Appeals, finding\nappellant Emilio Delgaco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder\nand imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua that was\ncertified to this Court for review, is hereby AFFIRMED subject to the\nMODIFICATION that appellant shall be civilly liable to the heirs of Alfonso\nSales, Jr. in the amount of fifty thousand pesos ( P 50,000.00).\n\nLet a copy of this Decision be\nfurnished the Philippine National Police and the Department of Justice which\nshall cause the arrest of Nestor Matubis whose appeal has been dismissed for\nhis failure to submit to the authority of this Court.
