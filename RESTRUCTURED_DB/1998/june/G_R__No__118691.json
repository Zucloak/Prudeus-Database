SUMALJAG, ACTING PRESIDING JUDGE, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 5, BAYBAY, LEYTE, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nMENDOZA, J.:\n\nThis is an administrative case against Judge Antonio C. Sumaljag,\n Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 5, Municipal Trial Court of Baybay, \nLeyte, for gross ignorance of the law in connection with the preliminary\n investigation of three criminal cases and the arrest of complainants.\n\nRespondent, whose regular station was at Branch 2 of the Municipal Trial Court of Albuera, Leyte, retired on December 13, 1996.\n\nComplainants Perlito D. Flores, Arlyn H. Arabilla, Domingo \nRamirez, Jorge Bandalan, Vicente Asilom, Mary Jane Villegas, Joel Diaz \nand Elvira Valenzona are members of the Sangguniang Pambarangay of \nDomingo C. Veloso in Baybay, Leyte, who were charged with three counts \nof falsification of public document as defined in Art. 171, pars. 2, 4 \nand 8 of the Revised Penal Code. In Criminal Case No. R-3231-A, it was \ncharged -\n\nThat on or about the 19th day of November, 1996, at Barangay \nDomingo C. Veloso (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, [all the herein \ncomplainants] in their capacities as members of Sangguniang Pambarangay \nof the said barangay (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, conspiring together and \nconfiderating (sic) themselves did then and there wilfully and \nfeloneously (sic) prepare a spurious and falsified excerpt from the \nalleged minutes of the purported regular session allegedly on August 24,\n 1996, which never was to falsely substantiate the purported Resolution \nNo. 14, Series of 1996, unduly protesting the application of complainant\n Gualberto Parmis to own Lot No. 521-A with the DENR, located in Sitio \nHayahay, Barangay Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8), Baybay, Leyte, with DENR \nof Ormoc City, intercalating thereby that Gualberto Parmis is not a \nresident of said Barangay when he is a bona fide resident thereat and in\n fact he has his house of abode erected thereat, by letting it appear \nalso in that spurious minutes alluded to as the result of a regular \nsession on August 24, 1996, when in fact and in truth, no regular \nsession was held on August 24, 1996, on the aspect of the said undue \nprotest to the application of Gualberto Parmis to own Lot No. 521-A with\n the DENR, that none of the accused deliberated nor discussed re the \nconcocted Resolution 14, alluded to, none of them signed the minutes or \nexcerpt thereof because no minutes whatsoever on that aspect was \nobtaining then on August 24, 1996, and the spurious minutes or excerpt \nthereof was only crafted unduly and contrively prepared only on November\n 19, 1996, to the damage and prejudice of the undersigned complainant \nGualberto Parmis in violation of item 8, Article 171 of the Revised \nPenal Code.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nIn Criminal Case No. R-3227-A, the complaint, filed by the chief of police of Baybay, Rolando C. Piamonte, charged -\n\nThat on or about the 24th day of August, 1996, at Barangay Domingo \nC. Veloso (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, [the herein complainants Perlito D.\n Flores and Arlyn H. Arabilla], in their capacities as Barangay Captain \nand Barangay Secretary, respectively, conspiring together and \nconfiderating (sic) themselves did then and there wilfully, and \nfeloneously (sic), prepare a purported Barangay Resolution No. 14, \nSeries of 1996, unduly protesting the application of one Gualberto \nParmis to own Lot No. 521-A, CSD 14542-D, located in Sitio Hayahay, \nBarangay Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8), Baybay, Leyte, with the DENR of \nOrmoc City, by narrating falsely having it appeared (sic) thereat that \nhe is not residing in said Barangay and it was enacted on motion of \nKagawad Rodulfo M. Roca at a regular session and attended by the \nBarangay Officials, Mr. Perlito D. Flores, Mr. Domingo C. Ramirez, Mr. \nJose M. Bandalan, Mr. Vicente J. Asilom, Mr. Diego C. Cala, Jr., Mr. \nRodulfo M. Roca, Mrs. Mary Jane L. Villegas, Mr. Joel A. Diaz, Miss Ma. \nElvira F. Valenzona and Mrs. Evelyn A. Calipayan, when in truth and in \nfact, there was no such regular session obtaining on such a date \nmentioned in the questioned resolution nor such resolution was enacted \non motion of Mr. Rodulfo M. Roca, nor such barangay officials mentioned \nthereon participated in the alleged proceeding as it never was as they \ndid not in fact participate and when verily Gualberto G. Parmis is a \nbona fide resident at said Barangay with his family and has a house \nthereat where he and his family have their abode to the damage and \nprejudice of Gualberto G. Parmis.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nIn Criminal Case No. R-3228-A, the complaint, which was also filed by the chief of police, charged -\n\nThat on or about the 24th day of August, 1996, at Barangay Domingo \nC. Veloso (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, [the herein complainants Perlito D.\n Flores and Arlyn H. Arabilla] in their capacities as Barangay Captain \nand Barangay Secretary, respectively, conspiring together and \nconfiderating (sic) themselves did then and there wilfully, and \nfeloneously (sic), prepare a purported Barangay Resolution No. 14, \nSeries of 1996, unduly protesting the application of one Gualberto \nParmis to own Lot No. 521-A, CSD 14542-D, located in Sitio Hayahay, \nBarangay Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8), Baybay, Leyte, with the DENR of \nOrmoc City, by falsely having it appeared thereat that Gualberto Parmis \nis not residing in said Barangay and it was enacted on motion of Kagawad\n Rodulfo M. Roca at a regular session and attended by the Barangay \nOfficials, Mr. Perlito D. Flores, Mr. Domingo C. Ramirez, Mr. Jorge M. \nBandalan, Mr. Vicente J. Asilom, Mr. Diego C. Cala, Jr., Mr. Rodulfo M. \nRoca, Mrs. Mary Jane L. Villegas, Mr. Joel A. Diaz, Miss Ma. Elvira F. \nValenzona and Mrs. Evelyn A. Calipayan, when in truth and in fact, there\n was no such regular session obtaining on such a date mentioned in the \nquestioned resolution nor such resolution was enacted on motion of \nKagawad Rodulfo M. Roca, nor such barangay officials mentioned therein \nparticipated in the alleged proceeding as it never was as they did not \nin fact participate.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nOn November 25, 1996, respondent judge conducted a preliminary \nexamination, during which the complainant, Gualberto Parmis, and his \nwitness, Diego Cala, Jr., testified in each of the criminal cases. \nThereafter, respondent judge ordered the arrest of herein complainants. \nBy virtue of warrants of arrest, the herein complainants were arrested \nand detained. They were later released on bail.\n\nThe complainants instituted this administrative case against \nrespondent judge. As Deputy Court Administrator Bernardo Abesamis \nsummarizes in his memorandum, complainantsâ allegations relate to four \nmain points: [1] the testimonies during the preliminary examinations failed to establish probable cause;\nin Criminal Case Nos. R-3227-A and R-3228-A, the complainant was \nnot personally examined by respondent, the ones who testified being only\n complainantâs witnesses;\nin Criminal Case No. R 3231-A, there was absence of âsearching \nquestions and answersâ during the preliminary examination, the questions\n propounded being answerable by âYes, Judgeâ;\nthere was no cause under the law to arrest them as the \npossibility of fleeing to escape the hands of justice is remote as they \nare barangay officials.\n\nDeputy Court Administrator Abesamis thought that the first and last \ncharges involve the exercise of judicial discretion in determining the \nexistence of probable cause and the probability of flight and therefore \nbelieved that these were not proper subjects of administrative \ndisciplinary action. However, he opined that the second and third \ncharges involve the âproper observance of procedural rules and due \nprocessâ and should be looked into. For this reason, he recommended that\n respondent judge be required to comment.\n\nRespondent was required to comment. In his comment dated May 14, \n1997, respondent maintained that he observed the pertinent legal \nprocedures before issuing the warrants of arrest against complainants. \nHe said that the quantum of evidence required in preliminary \ninvestigation had likewise been observed. He contended that, by posting \nbail, complainants waived objection to any irregularities which might \nhave been committed in the course of the preliminary investigation. \nRespondent claimed that the present case is just a rehash of another \nadministrative case filed against him (Administrative Case No. OCA-IPI \n97-253-MTJ) which was dismissed by this Court for lack of merit.\n\nFirst . Complainants claim that, contrary to Rule 112, \nÂ§6(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, respondent did not ask the \ncomplainant and the witnesses searching questions but mainly questions \ndesigned to make them merely affirm what they had previously stated in \ntheir affidavits. Deputy Court Administrator Abesamis notes that the \nquestions asked by the respondent were leading and ârevealed the \nlatterâs apparent knowledge of the case which the witness testifying had\n only to confirm with a âYes, Judge.ââ [2]\n\nThe transcript of the preliminary investigation shows that some \nof the questions asked by the respondent were indeed leading. It is \nevident, however, that he was dealing with witnesses who were reticent \nand had to be prodded if their examination was to be searching. Most of \nthe time, complainant Gualberto Parmis and his witness Diego Cala, Jr. \nmerely said âYes, Judgeâ in answer to questions put to them. The only \nway to make them explain was to ask them leading questions.\n\nDeputy Court Administrator Abesamis contends that the respondent \nrevealed his apparent knowledge of the facts of the case which the \nwitness testifying before him only needed to confirm with a âYes, \nJudge.â Obviously, this is because the judge based his questions on the \nallegations of the complaint and the affidavits of the complainant and \nthe witnesses. In fact, the first questions he asked concerned the \nexecution of affidavits. If the only way to make the witnesses give \ndetails was to ask questions based on their complaints and affidavits, \nwe see no reason why this should be considered improper. After all, the \nwitnesses could deny what the judge asked them if it was not true.\n\nThe following excerpt from the transcript of the preliminary \nexamination of complainant and his witness belies the allegations of \ncomplainants that respondent did not ask searching or probing questions \nbut, through leading questions, simply fished for evidence in \ndetermining probable cause.\n\nCOURT:\n\nQ- Your dialogue was made on the 15th day of November, 1996?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- But the resolution was passed in the regular session on August 24, 1996?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- And when she answered you she has not yet prepared the minutes and she has not yet prepared the logbook?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- So, in other words, said Secretary of the Barangay, Arlyn \nArabilla, has no knowledge whether there was Regular Session on August \n24, 1996, because she was only made to sign that prepared resolution by \nthe Barangay Captain?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- At that time on November 15, 1996 when you had a dialogue \nwith Arlyn Arabilla, was she able to present to you anything that would \nsupport their claim that there was a Regular Session held on August 24, \n1996?\nA- None.\n\nQ- Now, since you had a copy of that resolution, did you show this Resolution No. 14 to Arlyn Arabilla?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- And then, what did she say?\nA- She told me that this resolution was made from the excerpt of the minutes.\n\nQ- And said Secretary was not able to produce the minutes of that session supposedly held on August 24, 1996?\nA- Yes, Judge.\n\nQ- Were you alone when you went to the house of Arlyn Arabilla?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- So, in other words, there was no Regular Session ever held on\n August 24, 1996 as claim (sic) by the Barangay Captain which was the \nbasis for Resolution No. 14?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- It was only the Barangay Captain who prepared this resolution and there has been no minutes at all up to the present time?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- In other words, the Barangay Captain clearly falsified this Resolution No. 14?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- Although it appears to be attested by the Barangay Secretary \nwho claim (sic) that she was just requested and pressed by the Barangay \nCaptain to sign the said resolution?\nA- Yes, Judge.\n\nQ- Said resolution is not supported by any minutes?\nA- Yes, sir.\n\nQ- And when you find out this resolution, this was only a resolution handed to you by DENR without any supporting minutes?\nA- Yes, sir. [3]\n\nWhile some of the questions of the judge clearly suggested the \nanswers, nonetheless it is clear that the answers were still those of \nthe witnesses and not those of the judge. We are satisfied that as far \nas the duty to ask âsearching questionsâ is concerned, respondent \ncomplied with his duty under the Rules of Court.\n\nSecond . The complainants aver that the testimonies of \nGualberto Parmis and Diego Cala, Jr. during the preliminary examination \nfailed to establish probable cause. They cited instances to prove this \npoint.\n\n(1) Gualberto Parmis testified that the other barangay officials \ncharged in the complaint were only misled into signing Resolution No. 14\n by being asked by Perlito D. Flores, the punong barangay, to sign \nseveral papers, which they did not suspect included the resolution in \nquestion. Hence, it would appear that only Perlito D. Flores was guilty \nof âintercalating any instrumentâ in a registry or official book within \nthe meaning of Art. 171(8) of the Revised Penal Code. The other barangay\n officials are innocent.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the charge against complainants\n herein is that, as barangay officials, they prepared a spurious excerpt\n from the minutes of an alleged session of the barangay council in order\n to show that Resolution No. 14, Series of 1996 had been adopted at the \nsession allegedly held on August 24, 1996 of the Sangguniang \nPambarangay. Even if the barangay officials signed Resolution No. 14 by \nmistake, this fact would not show that they did not take part in the \npreparation of spurious minutes or excerpts thereof.\n\n(2) According to complainants, Diego Cala, Jr. testified that, on\n August 24, 1996, he could not have taken part in the deliberation of \nthe Sangguniang Pambarangay of Domingo C. Veloso in Baybay, Leyte \nbecause he was then in Cebu. Therefore, he could not have known whether \nor not the council had a session on that day and whether the other \nmembers were not present at its session.\n\nComplainants miss the point. Precisely, what Diego Cala, Jr. is \nsaying is that he could not have attended the session of the barangay \ncouncil on August 24, 1996 because he was then in Cebu.\n\nAnyway, the determination of the individual liability of the \naccused would have to await trial. For purposes of the preliminary \ninvestigation, which was summary in nature, it was enough that there was\n evidence showing that the crime had been committed and that the accused\n were probably guilty thereof. Any error which might have been committed\n at this stage could be corrected after the case was filed in the \nRegional Trial Court. As held in Angcog v. Tan ,\n\nthe determination that there was probable cause which is judgmental\n and which, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion or malice, may \nnot necessarily give rise to disciplinary action . . . [4]\n\nTo hold a judge accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision \nwhich he might render would be nothing short of harassment and would \nmake his job unbearable. [5]\n\nThird . Complainants point out that in Criminal Cases \nNos. R-3227-A and R-3228-A, only the witnesses were examined by the \njudge. The chief of police was the complainant but he was not examined. \nComplainants cite Rule 112, Â§6(b) which provides:\n\n(b) By the Municipal Trial Court . --- If the\n municipal trial court judge conducting the preliminary investigation is\n satisfied after an examination in writing and under oath of the complainant and his witnesses in the form of searching questions and answers, that a probable cause \nexists and that there is a necessity of placing the respondent under \nimmediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice, he \nshall issue a warrant of arrest. (Emphasis added)\n\nThe contention has no merit. The complainant in these cases is not \nthe chief of police. The chief of police signed the complaints in these \ncases simply as prosecutor, pursuant to Rule 110, Â§5 which in part \nprovides:\n\nWho must prosecute criminal actions . --- . . . [I]n the \nMunicipal Trial Courts or Municipal Circuit Trial Courts when there is \nno fiscal available, the offended party, any peace officer or public officer charged with the enforcement of the law violated may prosecute the case. (Emphasis added)\n\nThe complainant in the two cases was Gualberto Parmis, who testified, together with Diego Cala, Jr.\n\nFourth . Finally, it is contended that respondent ordered\n the arrest of complainants without the justification of doing so âin \norder not to frustrate the ends of justice,â as provided in Rule 112, \nÂ§6(b).\n\nWe find this contention to be meritorious. What differentiates \nthe present rule from the previous one before the 1985 revision of the \nRules on Criminal Procedure is that while before, it was mandatory for \nthe investigating judge to issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused\n if he found probable cause, the rule now is that the investigating \njudgeâs power to order the arrest of the accused is limited to instances\n in which there is a necessity for placing him in custody âin order not \nto frustrate the ends of justice.â The arrest of the accused can be \nordered only in the event the prosecutor files the case and the judge of\n the Regional Trial Court finds probable cause for the issuance of a \nwarrant of arrest. As this Court said in Samulde v. Salvani, Jr. : [6]\n\nIt is entirely new rule, and it is plain to see that it is not \nobligatory, but merely discretionary, upon the investigating judge to \nissue a warrant for the arrest of the accused, even after having \npersonally examined the complainant and his witnesses in the form of \nsearching questions and answers, for the determination of whether a \nprobable cause exists and whether it is necessary to arrest the accused \nin order not to frustrate the ends of justice, is left to his sound \njudgment or discretion.\n\nAccordingly, in Mantaring v. Roman , [7] we reprimanded a judge in a preliminary investigation for issuing a \nwarrant without any finding that it was necessary to place the accused \nin immediate custody in order to prevent a frustration of justice. In \nthis case, it appears that respondent ordered the issuance of a warrant \nof arrest solely on his finding of probable cause, totally omitting to \nconsider whether it was necessary to do so in order not to frustrate the\n ends of justice.\n\nAs already stated, respondent has since retired. This fact, \nhowever, does not render this case moot and academic. As held in Gallo \nv. Cordero: [8]\n\n[T]he jurisdiction that was ours at the time of the filing of the \nadministrative complaint was not lost by the mere fact that the \nrespondent public official had ceased in office during the pendency of \nhis case. The Court retains its jurisdiction either to pronounce the \nrespondent official innocent of the charges or declare him guilty \nthereof. A contrary rule would be fraught with injustices and pregnant \nwith dreadful and dangerous implications . . . . If innocent, respondent\n officials merits vindication of his name and integrity as he leaves the\n government which he has served well and faithfully; if guilty, he \ndeserves to receive the corresponding censure and a penalty proper and \nimposable under the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, considering that respondent judge has retired, the\n only appropriate penalty that could be imposed on him, in light of what\n he failed to do in this case, is a fine of P5,000.00. [9]\n\nAccordingly, a FINE of P5,000.00 is hereby imposed on respondent \nJudge Antonio Sumaljag, the amount to be deducted from whatever \nretirement benefits he may be entitled to receive.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nRegalado, (Chairman), Melo, Puno, and Martinez, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 1.\n\n[2] Id., p. 2.\n\n[3] TSN of the Preliminary Examination of Criminal Case No. R-3227-A held on November 25, 1996, pp. 5-7.\n\n[4] 227 SCRA 137, 143 (1993).\n\n[5] Arcenio v.
