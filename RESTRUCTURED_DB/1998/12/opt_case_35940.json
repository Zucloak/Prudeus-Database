No. P-97-1256, June 22, 1998 ]\n\nMARTIN V. BRIZUELA, COMPLAINANT, VS. DEPUTY SHERIFFS JOSEPH ANTONIL OF BRANCH 63; ERIBERTO DE CASTRO AND VILLAMOR VILLEGAS OF THE OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENTS.R E S O L U T I O N\nMARTIN V. BRIZUELA, COMPLAINANT, VS. DEPUTY SHERIFFS JOSEPH ANTONIL OF BRANCH 63; ERIBERTO DE CASTRO AND VILLAMOR VILLEGAS OF THE OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nVITUG, J.:\n\nJoseph Antonil, Eriberto de Castro and Villamor Villegas, all Deputy Sheriffs assigned to the Regional Trial Court of Makati, [1] were charged by Martin V. Brizuela with grave misconduct, oppression \nand dishonesty in connection with the alleged wrongful implementation of\n a writ of possession and an alias writ of possession issued in\n LRC Case No. M-3510. Brizuela, the respondent in the LRC case, averred \nthat respondent Sheriffs implemented a writ of possession, dated 24 May \n1995, on 24 August 1995 which was well beyond the sixty-day period \nprovided for by the Rules of Court within which the writ could be \nenforced. The complainant claimed that no one was in his house when the \nwrit was implemented and respondent Sheriffs merely broke open the steel\n gates of the premises, entered the house, took out the personal \nbelongings thereat and placed the items on the garage. He and his \nfamily, however, were able to later gain possession of the premises but \nonly after the security guards posted thereat were told of the pending \ncases with the Court of Appeals involving the property. The complainant \nadmitted that the temporary restraining order issued by the Court of \nAppeals had already expired but he maintained that respondent Sheriffs \nshould have accorded due courtesy to the appellate court where a motion \nfor the reconsideration of the denial of his motion for the issuance of \nan injunctive writ was filed. The complainant added that the irregular \nactuations of respondent Sheriffs were repeated on 01 September 1995 \nwhen the latter returned, accompanied by about a hundred personnel, to \nimplement an alias writ of possession without bothering to wait\n for the resolution of his pending motion for reconsideration with the \nappellate court. This second time around, respondent Sheriffs took \npersonal belongings worth about P5,000,000.00.\n\nRespondent Sheriff de Castro, in his comment, dated 12 January \n1996, explained that he only had taken part in the implementation of the alias writ of possession. He sought assistance from the \nStation Commander of Block 3, Bangkal, Makati City, because the \ncomplainant had hired seven heavily armed security guards from the ACD \nInvestigation Security Agency in an attempt to thwart the enforcement of\n the writ. De Castro said that he and his fellow respondents did not \nattempt to implement the writ, until after complainant's lawyer arrived \nat about five o'clock in the afternoon, in order to give complainant a \nchance to secure a restraining order. Finally, de Castro maintained, the\n writ had been implemented in accordance with the rules prescribed \ntherefor.\n\nRespondent Sheriff Villegas, in his comment of 12 January 1996, \ninformed the Court that he, like his co-respondent de Castro, had only \ntaken part in the implementation of the alias writ of possession. He reiterated, in substance, the statements of de Castro in the latter's comment of even date.\n\nRespondent Sheriff Antonil, in his comment, likewise dated 12 \nJanuary 1996, stated for his part that after the issuance of the writ of\n possession by Judge Ruben A. Mendiola of the Regional Trial Court of \nMakati City, he promptly went on to serve it upon the spouses Brizuela \nwho were given eight days from receipt thereof within which to vacate \nthe premises. Due to the petition to stay the implementation of the writ\n filed by the spouses, he had to hold in abeyance any further action on \nthe writ until after the petition was acted upon. The petition was \ndenied on 19 June 1995. On 23 June 1995, respondent Antonil served on \nthe spouses a notice to vacate the premises. He tried to implement the \nwrit on 27 June 1995 only to find out that the premises had been \npadlocked. The Brizuela spouses, in the meantime, sought a \nreconsideration of the denial of their petition to stay the \nimplementation of the writ while the counsel for Integrated Credit and \nCorporate Services Company (\"Integrated Credit\"), the plaintiff in LRC \nCase No. M-3510, filed a motion to break open the premises. On 05 July \n1995, the trial court, without ruling on the motion to break open the \npremises, denied the spouses' motion for reconsideration. The Brizuelas \nwent to the Court of Appeals for relief. On 07 July 1995, the appellate \ncourt issued an order temporarily restraining respondent Antonil from \nimplementing the writ of possession. Then, in its resolution of 07 \nAugust 1995, the Court of Appeals denied the Brizuelas' prayer for the \nissuance of a preliminary prohibitory injunction. On 24 August 1995, \nafter giving the spouses sufficient time within which to voluntarily \nvacate the premises, respondent Antonil finally implemented, in the \npresence of security guards of Magallanes Village and with the help of \nmembers of the Magallanes PNP Detachment Unit, the writ of possession. \nThe property of the spouses were inventoried and thereafter turned over \nto the security guards of Magallanes Village and the Integrated Credit \nfor safekeeping. On 29 August 1995, the trial court issued an alias writ\n of possession which respondent Antonil, together with respondents de \nCastro and Villegas, implemented on 01 September 1995. Respondent \nSheriffs sought the assistance of the Station Commander of Block 3, \nBangkal, Makati, after discovering that the Brizuelas had hired seven \nheavily armed security guards from ACD Investigation Security Agency to \nprevent the enforcement of the alias writ. The alias writ was implemented only after the counsel for the Brizuelas had failed to secure another restraining order.\n\nIn the Court's resolution, dated 05 June 1996, acting upon the \nrecommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (\"OCA\"), the \ncomplaint was dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nComplainant forthwith moved for a reconsideration. The Court, in \nits resolution of 11 November 1996, required respondents to comment on \nthe motion for reconsideration. In its resolution of 22 October 1997, \nthe Court, after deliberating on the motion for reconsideration and the \ncomments thereon, resolved to so docket the case as an administrative \nmatter. The parties were also required to manifest whether or not they \nwould be willing to submit the case for resolution on the basis of \npleadings and documents theretofore filed.\n\nTo date, the parties have yet to file the required manifestations, which the Court will now dispense with.\n\nRespondent Antonil did implement the writ of possession only on \n24 August 1995 or 93 days from the date of its issuance on 23 May 1995. \nEven if, indeed, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining \norder on 17 July 1995, it only tolled the running of the 60-day period \nfor 20 days. Nevertheless, respondent Sheriff Antonil could not be said \nto have acted in bad faith. He put off the implementation of the writ of\n possession while complainant and his spouse were filing one pleading \nafter another in the hope of suspending the enforcement of the writ. \nThese circumstances considered, the imposition of a fine of P1,000.00 \nrecommended by the OCA would be severe. The Court deems it proper to \ninstead administer a reprimand on respondent Joseph Antonil. There being\n no irregularity established in the implementation of the alias writ of possession, respondent Eriberto De Castro and respondent Villamor Villegas are absolved from any liability therefor.\n\nWHEREFORE , respondent Sheriff Joseph Antonil is \nREPRIMANDED and cautioned to be more circumspect than he has heretofore \nshown. The administrative charges against respondent Eriberto De Castro \nand respondent Villamor Villegas are dismissed.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nDavide, Jr., Belossillo, Panganiban, and Quisumbing JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Antonil is assigned to Branch 63 while de Castro and Villegas are assigned to the Office of the Clerk of Court.\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",
