  "title": "SEBASTIAN GARCIA, PETITIONER, VS. JUANITO A. PAJARO AND THE CITY OF DAGUPAN, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: The city treasurer of Dagupan has the authority to institute disciplinary actions against subordinate officers or employees. The essence of due process in an administrative proceeding is the opportunity to explain oneâs side, whether written or verbal. The constitutional mandate is satisfied when a petitioner complaining about an action or a ruling is granted an opportunity to seek reconsideration. Statement of the Case Before us is a Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 17, 1999 Decision[1] and the December 14, 1999 Resolution[2] of the Court of Appeals[3] (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 48285. The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows: âWHEREFORE, finding no reversible error in the appealed decision, [this Court hereby affirms it] in toto. No costs.â[4] The assailed Resolution denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration. The affirmed Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dagupan City (Branch 40), disposed as follows: âWHEREFORE, this case is hereby DISMISSED, without costs.â[5] The Facts The factual antecedents of the case, as summarized by the RTC and adopted by the CA, are reproduced as follows: âEvidence for the petitioner tends to show that petitioner SEBASTIAN GARCIA, 61, married, employee at the City Treasurerâs Office, Dagupan City and resident of Lucao, Dagupan City, has been employee thereat since June 15, 1974 as Revenue Collector appointed to that position by then City Mayor Cipriano Manaois. He was ordered suspended by City Treasurer Juanito Pajaro from June 1, 1990 to March 15, 1992 and directed the withholding of his salary because of the Formal Charge filed against him. He resumed work on March 16, 1992 as Local Treasury Officer III. When he was suspended, his position was Local Treasury Officer and Revenue Officer with a salary of P6,800.00 a month. When he resumed work, his salary was already P7,615.00 monthly. From June 1, 1990 up to March 15, 1992, he had been reporting for work because he did not honor the suspension order as the City Treasurer acted as the complainant, investigator and judge and there was no complaint against him from the Office of the City Mayor. He did not believe in the Order; he did not submit himself for investigation. He was not paid his salary because of the suspension order which caused his sleepless nights, his two (2) children stopped schooling, he has to beg from his relatives. He has a wife with four (4) children in college, one in Commerce, another taking up Dentistry. During the 1990 earthquake, there was calamity loan granted to employees but he could not avail of it because the City Treasurer would not approve the loan. He is asking P1,000,000.00 for his mental anguish and sufferings. From July to October, 1987 the City Treasurer refused to give him his COLA, differential, cash gift, salary and mid-year bonus amounting to P6,800.00 up to the present. His salary now is P13,715.00 as Treasury Officer III. Contrary to the charges of the City Treasurer, he has been doing his duties and obligations; that for the acts of charging him in the Department of Finance and for charging him for neglect of duties, he felt deeply hurt and is asking P250,000.00 for that; his agreement with his counsel is P25% of what will be awarded to him. âPetitionerâs documentary evidence consists of the following: Exhibit âAâ, Order of Preventive Suspension dated June 1, 1990; Exhibit âBâ, Memorandum addressed to the disbursing Officer dated June 1, 1990; Exhibit âCâ, Formal Charge; Exhibit âDâ, Subpoena issued by respondent Pajaro; Exhibit âEâ, Communication dated June 1, 1990 to Regional Director, Bureau of Local Government, Department of Finance by the City Treasurer; Exhibit âFâ, Answer by respondent. âEvidence for Respondent PAJARO tends to show that âJUANITO PAJARO, 65, married, City Treasurer of Dagupan City, first served in concurrent capacity and OIC on December 4, 1981 and was regularly appointed as City Treasurer on January 2, 1986 up to the present. Petitioner Sebastian Garcia is at present the Local Treasury Officer III but way back in 1990 he was Senior Revenue Collector whose immediate superior was the late Mr. Viray, the Chief of the Local Taxes, then the Assistant City Treasurer, and the City Treasurer himself. Petitioner has been rating Unsatisfactory in his performance for several semesters which is the reason a [Formal] Charge was filed against petitioner received by him on June 1, 1990, 10:00 a.m. and, as a matter of procedure, if the charge is a major offense, by civil service laws, he was preventively suspended for ninety (90) days, also duly received by Mr. Garcia on June 4, 1990 at 2:00 p.m. Then an investigation was scheduled and a subpoena was issued to Mr. Garcia to appear and testify on August 15, 1990 duly received by him on August 1, 1990, 8:55. Again Mr. Garcia did not Answer and refused to honor the subpoena to submit himself for investigation. So he proceeded with ex-parte investigation and gathered and submitted testimonies to support the allegations in the Formal Charge then submitted the result of their findings to the Department of Finance for decision. A Decision was promulgated by the Department of Finance on August 1, 1991. The matter of preventive suspension of Mr. Garcia was submitted to the Regional Director, Bureau of Local Government Finance which was âfavorably approvedâ by the Regional Director. This case stemmed from the application of the petitioner for the position of supervising revenue collector and he was duly appointed. The same appointment was opposed by Mrs. Evangeline Estrada and by a resolution of the Civil Service Commission, the appointment of Mrs. Evangeline Estrada was duly confirmed. Mrs. Estrada was recommended first and she was issued an appointment by the City Mayor and was submitted to the CSC. It was contested by Mr. Garcia. The first ruling of the CSC was adverse to Mrs. Estrada and she requested for reconsideration. In the meantime, Mr. Garcia was able to get an appointment from the same City Mayor but it was not approved. The CSC reconsidered the request of Mrs. Estrada favorably as shown by Resolution 91-359 dated March 14, 1991. That position was affected by the reorganization and it was changed to Local Treasury Operations Officer III now occupied by Mrs. Estrada. Despite the fact that he was always u[p]held by the CSC and the Department of Finance, this case based on unfounded allegations was filed against him, he is confirming his counterclaim against the petitioner with 25% attorneyâs fees and P1,000.00 per appearance. Petitionerâs charge that his benefits were unduly withheld from him is not true because the law states when you are charged and preventively suspended, the salary could not be collected. As a matter of fact, the petitioner was not acquitted; there was additional penalty. He was penalized with a suspension of six (6) months without pay so he could not by any means collect his salary. On the other hand, he was the one being harrassed (sic) by the petitioner; it has affected his performance and efficiency in the office, including sleepless nights. In explaining the entries in the Performance [A]ppraisal Report, he said that the forms were given to the personnel to rate themselves and then the final rating goes to the supervisor. The personnel gave themselves excellent ratings but the basis of their record is the true assessment made by the supervisor. In this case, the petitioner should have protested when he received his copy but he did not. During the period of his preventive suspension, of course, the petitioner did not receive his salary. He is not aware of the petitionerâs allegation that he reported for work during the period of his preventive suspension, but that his co-employees testified that petitioner timed-in at 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. but did not make âtime-outsâ. âThe respondent City of Dagupan adopted the evidence of respondent Treasurer Pajaro. âAt the pre-trial conference, the parties agreed to limit the litigation on the following issues: 1) whether or not petitioner is entitled to right of action against the respondents; and 2) who is entitled to damages.â[6] (Citations omitted.) Ruling of the Court of Appeals Affirming the RTC Decision, the CA held that private respondent was vested with legal power and authority to institute disciplinary action against subordinate officers and employees.[7] The appellate court further held that the requisites of administrative due process had been fully observed by Respondent Pajaro while investigating petitioner. But despite being informed of the charges against him and being given the opportunity to be heard in a formal investigation, petitioner chose not to answer those charges.[8] Hence, this Petition.[9] Issues In his Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues for the Courtâs consideration: âFirst: Who has the power to remove, suspend or discipline the petitioner as a local employee, appointed by the City Mayor, the latter o[r] the City Treasurer? âSecond: Is the filing of the formal charge by the [private respondent] with himself valid? âThird: Is the suspension of the petitioner by virtue of the formal charge valid? âFourth: Who is liable for the unpaid salaries and benefits of the petitioner? âFifth: Is the respondent personally liable for the damages suffered by the petitioner?â[10] Simply stated, the issues boil down to two: 1. Whether the city treasurer of Dagupan can discipline petitioner 2. Whether petitionerâs right to due process was violated This Courtâs Ruling The Petition is not meritorious. First Issue: Disciplinary Authority of the City Treasurer Petitioner claims that the officer empowered to institute disciplinary proceedings against him is the city mayor of Dagupan -- not the city treasurer. He further asserts that under Section 78 of the Local Government Code of 1983,[11] the city treasurer does not have the power to discipline him. We are not persuaded. At the outset, it should be pointed out that under the old and the present Local Government Codes, appointive officers and employees of local government units are covered by the Civil Service Law; and such rules, regulations and other issuances duly promulgated pursuant thereto,[12] unless otherwise specified. Moreover, the investigation and the adjudication of administrative complaints against appointive local officials and employees, as well as their suspension and removal, shall be in accordance with the Civil Service Law and rules and other pertinent laws.[13] The Administrative Code of 1987,[14] -- specifically Book V on the civil service -- is the primary law governing appointive officials and employees in the government.[15] This Code enumerates the grounds for disciplining them.[16] They may be removed or dismissed summarily â(1) [w]hen the charge is serious and the evidence of guilt is strong; (2) [w]hen the respondent is a recidivist x x x; and (3) [w]hen the respondent is notoriously undesirable.â[17] Technical rules of procedure and evidence are not strictly applied; due process in the administrative context cannot be fully equated with that in the strict judicial sense.[18] The power to discipline is specifically granted by Section 47 of the Administrative Code of 1987[19] to heads of departments, agencies and instrumentalities, provinces and cities.[20] On the other hand, the power to commence administrative proceedings against a subordinate officer or employee is granted by Section 34 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of the said Administrative Code[21] to the secretary of a department, the head of office of equivalent rank, the head of a local government unit, the chief of an agency, the regional director or a person with a sworn written complaint. Further, the city treasurer may institute, motu propio, disciplinary proceedings against a subordinate officer or employee. Local Administrative Regulations (LAR) No. 2-85,[22] which was issued by the Ministry of Finance on March 27, 1985, authorized the minister (now secretary) of finance, the regional director, and head of a local treasury or an assessment office to start administrative disciplinary action against officers or employees subordinate to them. The pertinent portions of LAR 2-85 are reproduced hereunder: âRULE I - INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS âSec. 1. How commenced. â Administrative disciplinary action may be commenced against a subordinate officer or employee by the Minister of Finance, Regional Directors or heads of the local treasury or assessment offices at their own instance (motu proprio) or upon sworn written complaint by any other person. âIn the case of a complaint filed by any other person, the complainant shall submit sworn statements covering his testimony and those of his witnesses together with his documentary evidence. x x x x x x x x x âRULE IV - HEARING âSec. 1. Officer authorized to conduct hearings. -- The investigation shall be conducted by the Minister of Finance or the Director for Local Government Finance or his/her assistants or regional director or head of office concerned or the duly designated representatives of said officials. The duly designated representatives shall make the necessary report and recommendation to the chief of office, regional director or this Ministry, as the case may be. The investigation shall be held not earlier than five (5) days not later than ten (10) days from date of receipt of respondentâs answer by the disciplining authority and shall be finished within thirty (30) days from commencement of the hearing, unless the period is extended or continuance allowed in meritorious cases.â[23] In the case at bar, the city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority referred to in Section 47 of the Administrative Code of 1987.[24] The term âagencyâ refers to any of the various units of the government including a department, a bureau, an office, an instrumentality, a government-owned or controlled corporation, or a local government or a distinct unit therein.[25] Respondent Pajaro, as the city treasurer, was the head of the Office of the Treasurer; while petitioner, a senior revenue collector, was an officer under him. Thus, the city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority who could investigate petitioner and issue a preventive suspension order against him.[26] Petitionerâs contention that it is only the city mayor who may discipline him[27] is not persuasive. Section 455 (b-1-x) [28] of the 1991 Local Government Code states that the city mayor âmay cause to be instituted administrative or judicial proceedings against any official or employee of the city.â This rule is not incongruent with the provisions of the 1987 Administrative Code, which authorizes the heads of agencies to discipline subordinate employees.[29] Likewise, the old Local Government Code does not vest in city mayors the sole power to discipline and to institute criminal or administrative actions against any officers or employees under their jurisdiction.[30] In fact, there is no provision under the present Local Government Code expressly rescinding the authority of the Department of Finance to exercise disciplinary authority over its employees.[31] By the same token, there is nothing that prohibits the city treasurer from filing a complaint against petitioner.[32] As a corollary, the power to discipline evidently includes the power to investigate.[33] In Hagad v. Gozo-Dadole,[34] we explained the rationale for preventive suspension as follows: âx x x. Be that, as it may, we have heretofore held that, not being in the nature of a penalty, a preventive suspension can be decreed on an official under investigation after charges are brought and even before the charges are heard. Naturally, such a preventive suspension would occur prior to any finding of guilt or innocence.â[35] âx x x. Suspension is a preliminary step in an administrative investigation. If after such investigation, the charges are established and the person investigated is found guilty of acts warranting his removal, then he is removed or dismissed. This is the penalty. There is, therefore, nothing improper in suspending an officer pending his investigation and before the charges against him are heard and be given opportunity to prove his innocence.â[36] In the present case, Respondent Pajaro was authorized to issue the assailed Preventive Suspension Order against petitioner, because the latter was charged with gross neglect of duty, refusal to perform official duties and functions, and insubordination[37] -- grounds that allowed the issuance of such Order, as provided by Section 51 of the 1987 Administrative Code.[38] Clearly, the city treasurer acted within the scope of his power when he commenced the investigation and issued the assailed Order.[39] Second Issue: Due Process Petitioner argues that his right to due process was violated, because he was not heard during the administrative proceedings.[40] We are not convinced. In an administrative proceeding, the essence of due process is simply the opportunity to explain oneâs side.[41] Such process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered.[42] One may be heard, not solely by verbal presentation in an oral argument, but also -- and perhaps even many times more creditably and practicably -- through pleadings.[43] So long as the parties are given the opportunity to explain their side, the requirements of due process are satisfactorily complied with.[44] Moreover, this constitutional mandate is deemed satisfied if a person is granted an opportunity to seek reconsideration of an action or a ruling.[45] In the case at bar, the administrative proceedings were conducted in accordance with the procedure[46] set out in the 1987 Administrative Code and other pertinent laws. First, petitioner was furnished a copy of the May 30, 1990 formal charge[47] against him. Second, Respondent Pajaro requested the approval of the Order of Preventive Suspension[48] in his June 1, 1990 letter[49] addressed to the Bureau of Local Government Finance regional director, who approved the Order in the First Indorsement[50] dated June 4, 1990. Third, a subpoena[51] dated July 31, 1990 was issued to petitioner ordering him to testify during an investigation on August 15, 1990. However, he admittedly[52] refused to attend the investigation; thus, it was conducted ex parte. Fourth, the Department of Finance affirmed Respondent Pajaroâs findings in its August 1, 1991 Decision,[53] the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: âPREMISES CONSIDERED, [petitioner] is hereby found guilty of Inefficiency in the Performance of Official Duty and is hereby meted the penalty of six (6) months suspension from Office without pay to take effect upon receipt of this Decision, pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 30, series of 1989 of the Civil Service Commission, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.â[54] We need only to reiterate that parties who choose not to avail themselves of the opportunity to answer charges against them cannot complain of a denial of due process.[55] Petitionerâs refusal to attend the scheduled hearings, despite due notice, was at his own peril.[56] He therefore cannot validly claim that his right to due process was violated.[57] As to petitionerâs claim for damages, the extant rule is that a public officer shall not be liable by way of moral and exemplary damages for acts done in the performance of official duties, unless there is a clear showing of bad faith, malice or gross negligence.[58] There was no such showing in the present case.

No. 141149, July 05, 2002 ]\n\nSEBASTIAN GARCIA, PETITIONER,\nVS. JUANITO A. PAJARO AND THE CITY OF DAGUPAN, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nSEBASTIAN GARCIA, PETITIONER,\nVS. JUANITO A. PAJARO AND THE CITY OF DAGUPAN, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nThe city\ntreasurer of Dagupan has the authority to institute disciplinary actions\nagainst subordinate officers or employees. The essence of due process in an administrative proceeding is the\nopportunity to explain oneâs side, whether written or verbal. The constitutional mandate is satisfied when\na petitioner complaining about an action or a ruling is granted an opportunity\nto seek reconsideration.\n\nStatement\nof the Case\n\nBefore us is a\nPetition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 17,\n1999 Decision [1] and the December 14, 1999\nResolution [2] of the Court of Appeals [3] (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 48285. The decretal portion of the Decision reads\nas follows: âWHEREFORE, finding no reversible\nerror in the appealed decision, [this Court hereby affirms it] in toto . No costs.â [4]\n\nThe assailed\nResolution denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe affirmed\nDecision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dagupan City (Branch 40),\ndisposed as follows: âWHEREFORE, this case is hereby\nDISMISSED, without costs.â [5]\n\nThe\nFacts\n\nThe factual\nantecedents of the case, as summarized by the RTC and adopted by the CA, are\nreproduced as follows: âEvidence for the petitioner tends\nto show that petitioner SEBASTIAN GARCIA, 61, married, employee at the City\nTreasurerâs Office, Dagupan City and resident of Lucao, Dagupan City, has been\nemployee thereat since June 15, 1974 as Revenue Collector appointed to that\nposition by then City Mayor Cipriano Manaois. He was ordered suspended by City Treasurer Juanito Pajaro from June 1,\n1990 to March 15, 1992 and directed the withholding of his salary because of\nthe Formal Charge filed against him. He\nresumed work on March 16, 1992 as Local Treasury Officer III. When he was suspended, his position was\nLocal Treasury Officer and Revenue Officer with a salary of P 6,800.00 a\nmonth. When he resumed work, his salary\nwas already P 7,615.00 monthly. From June 1, 1990 up to March 15, 1992, he had been reporting for work\nbecause he did not honor the suspension order as the City Treasurer acted as\nthe complainant, investigator and judge and there was no complaint against him\nfrom the Office of the City Mayor. He\ndid not believe in the Order; he did not submit himself for investigation. He was not paid his salary because of the\nsuspension order which caused his sleepless nights, his two (2) children\nstopped schooling, he has to beg from his relatives. He has a wife with four (4) children in college, one in Commerce,\nanother taking up Dentistry. During the\n1990 earthquake, there was calamity loan granted to employees but he could not\navail of it because the City Treasurer would not approve the loan. He is asking P 1,000,000.00 for his\nmental anguish and sufferings. From\nJuly to October, 1987 the City Treasurer refused to give him his COLA,\ndifferential, cash gift, salary and mid-year bonus amounting to P 6,800.00\nup to the present. His salary now is P 13,715.00\nas Treasury Officer III. Contrary to\nthe charges of the City Treasurer, he has been doing his duties and\nobligations; that for the acts of charging him in the Department of Finance and\nfor charging him for neglect of duties, he felt deeply hurt and is asking P 250,000.00\nfor that; his agreement with his counsel is P 25% of what will be awarded\nto him. âPetitionerâs documentary evidence\nconsists of the following: Exhibit âAâ, Order of Preventive\nSuspension dated June 1, 1990; Exhibit âBâ, Memorandum addressed\nto the disbursing Officer dated June 1, 1990; Exhibit âCâ, Formal Charge; Exhibit âDâ, Subpoena issued by\nrespondent Pajaro; Exhibit âEâ, Communication dated June 1, 1990 to Regional Director,\nBureau of Local Government, Department of Finance by the City Treasurer; Exhibit âFâ, Answer by respondent. âEvidence for Respondent PAJARO\ntends to show that âJUANITO PAJARO, 65, married, City\nTreasurer of Dagupan City, first served in concurrent capacity and OIC on\nDecember 4, 1981 and was regularly appointed as City Treasurer on January 2,\n1986 up to the present. Petitioner\nSebastian Garcia is at present the Local Treasury Officer III but way back in\n1990 he was Senior Revenue Collector whose immediate superior was the late Mr.\nViray, the Chief of the Local Taxes, then the Assistant City Treasurer, and the\nCity Treasurer himself. Petitioner has\nbeen rating Unsatisfactory in his performance for several semesters which is\nthe reason a [Formal] Charge was filed against petitioner received by him on\nJune 1, 1990, 10:00 a.m. and, as a matter of procedure, if the charge is a\nmajor offense, by civil service laws, he was preventively suspended for ninety\n(90) days, also duly received by Mr. Garcia on June 4, 1990 at 2:00 p.m. Then an investigation was scheduled and a\nsubpoena was issued to Mr. Garcia to appear and testify on August 15, 1990 duly\nreceived by him on August 1, 1990, 8:55. Again Mr. Garcia did not Answer and refused to honor the subpoena to\nsubmit himself for investigation. So he\nproceeded with ex-parte investigation and gathered and submitted testimonies to\nsupport the allegations in the Formal Charge then submitted the result of their\nfindings to the Department of Finance for decision. A Decision was promulgated by the Department of Finance on August\n1, 1991. The matter of preventive\nsuspension of Mr. Garcia was submitted to the Regional Director, Bureau of\nLocal Government Finance which was âfavorably approvedâ by the Regional\nDirector. This case stemmed from the\napplication of the petitioner for the position of supervising revenue collector\nand he was duly appointed. The same\nappointment was opposed by Mrs. Evangeline Estrada and by a resolution of the\nCivil Service Commission, the appointment of Mrs. Evangeline Estrada was duly\nconfirmed. Mrs. Estrada was recommended\nfirst and she was issued an appointment by the City Mayor and was submitted to\nthe CSC. It was contested by Mr.\nGarcia. The first ruling of the CSC was\nadverse to Mrs. Estrada and she requested for reconsideration. In the meantime, Mr. Garcia was able to get\nan appointment from the same City Mayor but it was not approved. The CSC reconsidered the request of Mrs.\nEstrada favorably as shown by Resolution 91-359 dated March 14, 1991. That position was affected by the\nreorganization and it was changed to Local Treasury Operations Officer III now\noccupied by Mrs. Estrada. Despite the fact\nthat he was always u[p]held by the CSC and the Department of Finance, this case\nbased on unfounded allegations was filed against him, he is confirming his\ncounterclaim against the petitioner with 25% attorneyâs fees and P 1,000.00\nper appearance. Petitionerâs charge\nthat his benefits were unduly withheld from him is not true because the law\nstates when you are charged and preventively suspended, the salary could not be\ncollected. As a matter of fact, the\npetitioner was not acquitted; there was additional penalty. He was penalized with a suspension of six\n(6) months without pay so he could not by any means collect his salary. On the other hand, he was the one being\nharrassed (sic) by the petitioner; it has affected his performance and\nefficiency in the office, including sleepless nights. In explaining the entries in the Performance [A]ppraisal Report,\nhe said that the forms were given to the personnel to rate themselves and then\nthe final rating goes to the supervisor. The personnel gave themselves excellent ratings but the basis of their\nrecord is the true assessment made by the supervisor. In this case, the petitioner should have protested when he\nreceived his copy but he did not. During the period of his preventive suspension, of course, the petitioner\ndid not receive his salary. He is not\naware of the petitionerâs allegation that he reported for work during the\nperiod of his preventive suspension, but that his co-employees testified that\npetitioner timed-in at 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. but did not make âtime-outsâ. âThe respondent City of Dagupan\nadopted the evidence of respondent Treasurer Pajaro. âAt the pre-trial conference, the\nparties agreed to limit the litigation on the following issues:\n\n1) whether or not petitioner is\nentitled to right of action against the respondents; and\n\n2) who is entitled to damages.â [6] (Citations omitted.)\n\nRuling\nof the Court of Appeals\n\nAffirming the\nRTC Decision, the CA held that private respondent was vested with legal power\nand authority to institute disciplinary action against subordinate officers and\nemployees. [7]\n\nThe appellate\ncourt further held that the requisites of administrative due process had been\nfully observed by Respondent Pajaro while investigating petitioner. But despite being informed of the charges\nagainst him and being given the opportunity to be heard in a formal\ninvestigation, petitioner chose not to answer those charges. [8]\n\nHence, this\nPetition. [9]\n\nIssues\n\nIn his\nMemorandum, petitioner raises the following issues for the Courtâs\nconsideration: âFirst: Who has the power to remove, suspend or discipline the petitioner\nas a local employee, appointed by the City Mayor, the latter o[r] the City\nTreasurer? âSecond: Is the filing of the formal charge by the [private respondent]\nwith himself valid? âThird: Is the suspension of the petitioner by virtue of the formal\ncharge valid? âFourth: Who is liable for the unpaid salaries and benefits of the\npetitioner? âFifth: Is the respondent personally liable for the damages suffered by\nthe petitioner?â [10]\n\nSimply stated,\nthe issues boil down to two:\n\n1. Whether the city treasurer of\nDagupan can discipline petitioner\n\n2. Whether petitionerâs right to\ndue process was violated\n\nThis\nCourtâs Ruling\n\nThe Petition is\nnot meritorious.\n\nFirst Issue:\n\nDisciplinary Authority of the City Treasurer\n\nPetitioner\nclaims that the officer empowered to institute disciplinary proceedings against\nhim is the city mayor of Dagupan -- not the city treasurer. He further asserts that under Section 78 of\nthe Local Government Code of 1983, [11] the city treasurer does not have\nthe power to discipline him.\n\nWe are not\npersuaded.\n\nAt the outset,\nit should be pointed out that under the old and the present Local Government\nCodes, appointive officers and employees of local government units are covered\nby the Civil Service Law; and such rules, regulations and other issuances duly\npromulgated pursuant thereto, [12] unless otherwise specified. Moreover, the investigation and the\nadjudication of administrative complaints against appointive local officials\nand employees, as well as their suspension and removal, shall be in accordance\nwith the Civil Service Law and rules and other pertinent laws. [13]\n\nThe\nAdministrative Code of 1987, [14] -- specifically Book V on the civil\nservice -- is the primary law governing appointive officials and employees in\nthe government. [15] This Code enumerates the grounds\nfor disciplining them. [16] They may be removed or dismissed\nsummarily â(1) [w]hen the charge is serious and the evidence of guilt is\nstrong; (2) [w]hen the respondent is a recidivist x x x; and (3) [w]hen the\nrespondent is notoriously undesirable.â [17] Technical rules of procedure and\nevidence are not strictly applied; due process in the administrative context\ncannot be fully equated with that in the strict judicial sense. [18]\n\nThe power to\ndiscipline is specifically granted by Section 47 of the Administrative Code of\n1987 [19] to heads of departments, agencies\nand instrumentalities, provinces and cities. [20] On the other hand, the power to\ncommence administrative proceedings against a subordinate officer or employee\nis granted by Section 34 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of the said\nAdministrative Code [21] to the secretary of a department,\nthe head of office of equivalent rank, the head of a local government unit, the\nchief of an agency, the regional director or a person with a sworn written\ncomplaint.\n\nFurther, the\ncity treasurer may institute, motu propio, disciplinary proceedings\nagainst a subordinate officer or employee. Local Administrative Regulations (LAR) No. 2-85, [22] which was issued by the Ministry of\nFinance on March 27, 1985, authorized the minister (now secretary) of finance,\nthe regional director, and head of a local treasury or an assessment office to\nstart administrative disciplinary action against officers or employees\nsubordinate to them. The pertinent\nportions of LAR 2-85 are reproduced hereunder: âRULE I - INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS âSec. 1. How commenced. â\nAdministrative disciplinary action may be commenced against a subordinate\nofficer or employee by the Minister of Finance, Regional Directors or heads of\nthe local treasury or assessment offices at their own instance (motu proprio)\nor upon sworn written complaint by any other person. âIn the case of a complaint filed\nby any other person, the complainant shall submit sworn statements covering his\ntestimony and those of his witnesses together with his documentary evidence.\n\nx x x x\nx x x x x âRULE IV - HEARING âSec. 1. Officer\nauthorized to conduct hearings . -- The investigation shall be conducted by\nthe Minister of Finance or the Director for Local Government Finance or his/her\nassistants or regional director or head of office concerned or the duly\ndesignated representatives of said officials. The duly designated\nrepresentatives shall make the necessary report and recommendation to the chief\nof office, regional director or this Ministry, as the case may be. The\ninvestigation shall be held not earlier than five (5) days not later than ten (10)\ndays from date of receipt of respondentâs answer by the disciplining authority\nand shall be finished within thirty (30) days from commencement of the hearing,\nunless the period is extended or continuance allowed in meritorious cases.â [23]\n\nIn the case at bar,\nthe city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority referred to in Section\n47 of the Administrative Code of 1987. [24] The term âagencyâ refers to any of\nthe various units of the government including a department, a bureau, an\noffice, an instrumentality, a government-owned or controlled corporation, or a local\ngovernment or a distinct unit therein. [25] Respondent Pajaro, as the city\ntreasurer, was the head of the Office of the Treasurer; while petitioner, a\nsenior revenue collector, was an officer under him. Thus, the city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority who\ncould investigate petitioner and issue a preventive suspension order against\nhim. [26]\n\nPetitionerâs\ncontention that it is only the city mayor who may discipline him [27] is not persuasive. Section 455 (b-1-x) [28] of the 1991 Local Government Code\nstates that the city mayor âmay cause to be instituted administrative or\njudicial proceedings against any official or employee of the city.â This rule\nis not incongruent with the provisions of the 1987 Administrative Code, which\nauthorizes the heads of agencies to discipline subordinate employees. [29] Likewise, the old Local Government\nCode does not vest in city mayors the sole power to discipline and to\ninstitute criminal or administrative actions against any officers or employees\nunder their jurisdiction. [30] In fact, there is no provision\nunder the present Local Government Code expressly rescinding the authority of\nthe Department of Finance to exercise disciplinary authority over its\nemployees. [31] By the same token, there is nothing\nthat prohibits the city treasurer from filing a complaint against petitioner. [32]\n\nAs a corollary,\nthe power to discipline evidently includes the power to investigate. [33] In Hagad v. Gozo-Dadole, [34] we explained the rationale for\npreventive suspension as follows: âx x x. Be that, as it may, we have heretofore held that, not being in\nthe nature of a penalty, a preventive suspension can be decreed on an official\nunder investigation after charges are brought and even before the charges are heard. Naturally, such a preventive suspension\nwould occur prior to any finding of guilt or innocence.â [35] âx x x. Suspension is a preliminary\nstep in an administrative investigation. If after such investigation, the charges are established and the person\ninvestigated is found guilty of acts warranting his removal, then he is removed\nor dismissed. This is the penalty.\nThere is, therefore, nothing improper in suspending an officer pending his\ninvestigation and before the charges against him are heard and be given\nopportunity to prove his innocence.â [36]\n\nIn the present\ncase, Respondent Pajaro was authorized to issue the assailed Preventive\nSuspension Order against petitioner, because the latter was charged with gross\nneglect of duty, refusal to perform official duties and functions, and\ninsubordination [37] -- grounds that allowed the\nissuance of such Order, as provided by Section 51 of the 1987 Administrative\nCode. [38] Clearly, the city treasurer acted\nwithin the scope of his power when he commenced the investigation and issued\nthe assailed Order. [39]\n\nSecond Issue:\n\nDue Process\n\nPetitioner\nargues that his right to due process was violated, because he was not heard\nduring the administrative proceedings. [40] We are not convinced.\n\nIn an\nadministrative proceeding, the essence of due process is simply the opportunity\nto explain oneâs side. [41] Such process requires notice and an\nopportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered. [42] One may be heard, not solely by\nverbal presentation in an oral argument, but also -- and perhaps even many times\nmore creditably and practicably -- through pleadings. [43] So long as the parties are given\nthe opportunity to explain their side, the requirements of due process are\nsatisfactorily complied with. [44] Moreover, this constitutional\nmandate is deemed satisfied if a person is granted an opportunity to seek\nreconsideration of an action or a ruling. [45]\n\nIn the case at\nbar, the administrative proceedings were conducted in accordance with the\nprocedure [46] set out in the 1987 Administrative\nCode and other pertinent laws. First ,\npetitioner was furnished a copy of the May 30, 1990 formal charge [47] against him. Second , Respondent Pajaro requested\nthe approval of the Order of Preventive Suspension [48] in his June 1, 1990 letter [49] addressed to the Bureau of Local\nGovernment Finance regional director, who approved the Order in the First\nIndorsement [50] dated June 4, 1990.\n\nThird , a subpoena [51] dated July 31, 1990 was issued to\npetitioner ordering him to testify during an investigation on August 15,\n1990. However, he admittedly [52] refused to attend the\ninvestigation; thus, it was conducted ex parte . Fourth , the Department of Finance\naffirmed Respondent Pajaroâs findings in its August 1, 1991 Decision, [53] the dispositive portion of which\nreads as follows: âPREMISES CONSIDERED, [petitioner]\nis hereby found guilty of Inefficiency in the Performance of Official Duty and\nis hereby meted the penalty of six (6) months suspension from Office without\npay to take effect upon receipt of this Decision, pursuant to Memorandum\nCircular No. 30, series of 1989 of the Civil Service Commission, with a stern\nwarning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be\ndealt with more severely.â [54]\n\nWe need only to\nreiterate that parties who choose not to avail themselves of the opportunity to\nanswer charges against them cannot complain of a denial of due process. [55] Petitionerâs refusal to attend the\nscheduled hearings, despite due notice, was at his own peril. [56] He therefore cannot validly claim\nthat his right to due process was violated. [57]\n\nAs to\npetitionerâs claim for damages, the extant rule is that a public officer shall\nnot be liable by way of moral and exemplary damages for acts done in the\nperformance of official duties, unless there is a clear showing of bad faith,\nmalice or gross negligence. [58] There was no such showing in the\npresent case.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Petition is hereby DENIED and the assailed Decision AFFIRMED . Costs against petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.

Section 78 of this Code provides: âSec. 78. Disciplinary\nJurisdiction. â (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the head of a\nlocal government unit shall have authority to remove, separate, suspend and\notherwise discipline officials and employees under his jurisdiction.

If the penalty imposed is heavier, the\ndecision shall be appealable to the Civil Service Commission which has final\nauthority upon all matters relating to the conduct, discipline and efficiency\nof local government officials and employees. If the respondent is in the career executive service, appeal shall be\nmade to the Career Service Board.\n\nâ(2) An appeal shall not prevent a decision from becoming\nexecutory, and in case the penalty is suspension or removal, the respondent\nshall be considered as having been\nunder preventive suspension during the pendency of an appeal in the event he\nwins such appeal. However, the respondent shall be paid his salary\ncorresponding to the period during which the appeal is pending in the event he\nis completely exonerated.â\n\n[12] Â§78 of The Local Government Code of 1991 provides:\nâSEC. 78. Civil Service Law, Rules and Regulations, and Other Related\nIssuances. â All matters pertinent to human resources and development in\nlocal government units shall be governed by the civil service law and such\nrules and regulations and other issuances promulgated pursuant thereto, unless\notherwise specified in this Code.â\n\nOn the other hand, Â§72 of the Local Government Code of\n1983 states: âSec. 72. Responsibility for Personnel Administration. â Each head of a local government unit shall be responsible for personnel\nadministration in his unit and shall take all personnel actions in accordance\nwith the constitutional provisions relative to the civil service and all laws\nand rules thereon, including such policies, guidelines and standards as the\nCivil Service Commission may establish.â\n\n[13] Â§84 of The Local Government Code of 1991 states: âSEC. 84. Administrative Discipline. â Investigation and\nadjudication of administrative complaints against appointive local officials\nand employees as well as their suspension and removal shall be in accordance\nwith the civil service law and rules and other pertinent laws. The results of such administrative\ninvestigations shall be reported to the Civil Service Commission.â\n\nOn the other hand, Â§77 of the Local Government Code of\n1983 provides: âSec. 77. Administrative Discipline. â Investigation\nand adjudication of administrative complaints against appointive local\nofficials and employees of local governments as well as their suspension and\nremoval shall be in accordance with the civil service law and rules and other\nlaws affecting the civil service.
