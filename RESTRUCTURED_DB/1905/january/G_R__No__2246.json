Lawrence for appellant.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.\n\nJOHNSON,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe defendant in this case was charged with the crime of parricide.\n\nThe proof shows that on the 1st day of April, 1904, in the pueblo of Licab, of the Province of Nueva Ecija, because of some disagreement existing between the accused and his wife, Paula Rayo, he did strike, beat, and wound said Paula Rayo with a club, from the effects of which wounds the said Paula Rayo died.\n\nThe Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced him to the penalty of\n\ncadena perpetua\n\nwith the accessories of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification and to pay the costs. The attorney appointed to represent the defendant in this court joins with the Solicitor-General of the Philippine Islands in recommending that the sentence of said court be affirmed.\n\nUpon examination of the proof the court finds the evidence sufficient to sustain the facts alleged in the complaint, as well as to justify the sentence of the Court of First Instance of said province.\n\nThe sentence of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija is therefore affirmed. So ordered.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa and Carson, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
