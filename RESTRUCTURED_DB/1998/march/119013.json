  "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALEX OLIANO Y PUGONG AND GABRIEL CALIAG, ACCUSED, ALEX OLIANO Y PUGONG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: Well-entrenched in our jurisprudence is the rule that findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are binding on appellate courts, unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misappreciated which, if considered, will affect the result of the case. The Case This is the doctrine applied by the Court in resolving this appeal from the Decision 1 of the Regional Trial Court of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 30, finding Appellant Alex Oliano y Pugong guilty of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Provincial Fiscal Celerino V. Jandoc filed an Information dated July 22, 1987 before the said court, accusing appellant, together with one Gabriel Caliag, of murder, allegedly committed as follows: âThat on or about the 16th day of March 1987, in the Municipality of Sta. Fe, Province of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Alex P. Oliano and Gabriel C. Caliag, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of treachery and evident premeditation and with intent to kill, attack and assault the person of Benjamin Matias by then and there firing at him with the use of a gun, thereby inflicting upon him mortal gunshot wounds, which were the direct and immediate cause of his death and all to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs. Contrary to law with the aggravating circumstance of having used illegally possessed firearm in committing the crime.â2 On August 12, 1987, both accused were arraigned in the Kalanguya dialect which they spoke and understood. Assisted by Counsel Rufino Lumase, both entered a plea of not guilty.3 In the course of the trial which ensued, Gabriel Caliag died.44 For this reason, the court a quo dismissed the case against him.5 On July 26, 1994, the lower court rendered its Decision,6 the dispositive portion of which reads: âWHEREFORE, finding the accused ALEX OLIANO guilty of Murder defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua; to pay the heirs of the victim Benjamin Matias the sum of P50,000.00; P10,000.00 as actual damages; and P30,000.00 as moral damages.â7 The appellant filed a motion for reconsideration,8 which however was denied by the trial court in its order dated September 15, 1994.9 Hence, this appeal.10 The Facts Version of the Prosecution The prosecution presented six witnesses, namely: (1) Nancy Basatan,11 a neighbor of the deceased; (2) Rosita Matias,12 the widow; (3) PFCs Samuel Caramat13 and (4) Bernabe Flores,14 the investigating and arresting officers; (5) Myrna Matias,15 the daughter of the victim; and (6) Dra. Violeta Rumbaua,16 who conducted the autopsy. The antecedent facts, culled from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, were briefly summarized by the solicitor general as follows: âOn March 16, 1987, Benjamin Matias and his wife, Rosita, attended the wedding of Helen Nebres and Hilario Bugan in the house of Hindok Nebres at Sitio Taktak, Barangay Atbo, Sta. Fe, Nueva Vizcaya. Among those who attended the wedding were accused Gabriel Caliag and Alex Oliano. While serving supper, Rosita heard Alex say âIf it is Benjamin Matias who will give meat, I will not accept it.â Benjamin Matias was then busy slicing meat for the guests. At about 11:45 that evening, Rosita and Benjamin went home. The distance of their house from that of the Nebresâ was about one-half kilometer. Benjamin walked ahead of Rosita. (x x x) It happened that there were two boulders located on the left side of the road leading to the coupleâs house. When they were only about a meter away from the boulders, somebody fired a gun at Benjamin hitting him at the back, the bullet exiting through his chest. Rosita then saw appellant Alex Oliano behind the boulders, holding a rifle. At that instance, Rosita uttered the following to appellant: âWhy did you kill my husband when in fact, he did not commit any fault against you?â Subsequently, appellant aimed his gun at her but it jammed. Rosita also saw the other accused Gabriel Caliag looking at her from behind a banana plant. Alex and Gabriel then ran away towards the mountain. Rosita went to her husband who was then lying face down on the ground and embraced him. The moon was bright that night, thus enabling Rosita to easily recognize appellant and his co-accused. Rosita is also familiar with appellant since he was 17 years old because they were neighbors. (x x x) Rosita called for help and her neighbor, Nancy Basatan came. The latter asked Rosita what happened. Rosita answered, âAlex Oliano shot my husband when we did not have any fault against him.â Later, her children, namely Ricardo, Edgar, and Dencio arrived together with two Barangay Captains Day-an Celo and Peter. Her children wanted to retaliate against Alex but she calmed them down. Several policemen also arrived and she explained to them how the incident happened. Station Commander Mariano Amlos then formed two groups of policemen, whom he directed to go to the houses of appellant and Caliag. Moments later, Bay-an Basatan arrived and told Rosita to go to his house. Rosita went to his house and there saw both appellant and Gabriel Caliag. Upon seeing appellant, she grabbed his collar and said âYou were the one who killed my husband.â Appellant cried and replied, âYou are even attending mass.â Caliag, on the other hand, looked happy, and even played the guitar. Both of them were then brought to the police station in Sta. Fe, Nueva Vizcaya. (x x x)â17 The result of the post-mortem examination18 reads: âI - EXTERNAL FINDINGS: A - Head and Neck: No significant findings. B - Chest: Gunshot wound, through and through Point of Entry - 0.8 cm. diameter with charred edges at 7th Intercostal Space, Midscapular line, left.

C - Abdomen: - no significant findings. D - Extremities: - No significant findings. III - CAUSE OF DEATH: Cardiac Arrest due to Gunshot wound on the Heart.â19 Version of the Defense The defense presented Accused Gabriel Caliag20 and Appellant Alex Oliano21 as main witnesses. In his Brief dated November 29, 1995, appellant adopted the trial courtâs summary of the testimony of the defense witnesses, viz.: âx x x. On March 16, 1987 at 10:00 A.M., he was at Tactac, Sta. Fe, Nueva Vizcaya to deliver rattan to a buyer. Then he went to Ocao to attend the wedding celebration and stayed there for more than 5 hours. He left the wedding at about 11:00 in the evening together with his father, mother, sister and students of Kalahan Academy and proceeded to the house of his father Ramon Oliano at Mancate, which is about 1/2 kilometer from the wedding celebration and arrived thereat 11:30 in the evening, then he slept on a folding bed in the corner of the house. At 2:00 in the morning, he was awakened by the policemen of Sta. Fe. Sgt. Amlos removed his blanket and awakened him and he wanted to talk to him. When he woke up, he saw Petra, Delia Paraguas and his mother sitted [sic] on a bench. Sgt. Amlos told him about the death of Benjamin Matias at Mancate and asked him as to who are his companions in coming from the wedding celebration and he told the police that his companion is a person named Benito. The policemen invited him to go with them but he intended not to go but his father advised him to go with them, so they proceeded to the house of Pay-an Basatan about 600 meters away. Later on, Rosita Matias and some policemen arrived. Gabriel Caliag was also there sitted [sic] in a chair. Rosita Matias pointed to them as the killers of her husband. Later on, the two accused together with the policemen went to Sta. Fe and the accused were locked in jail for two hours. Then they were brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Echague, Isabela for paraffin examination. After the examination, the policemen returned them to Sta. Fe; that it is not true that they killed Benjamin Matias. x x x.â âDELBERT RICE, a Pastor of the Christian Kalahan Parish, testified that he had personally known the two accused for 25 years because they are his students in the Kalahan Academy; that he also knows the victim being a member of their congregation in Mancate and his compadre; that on March 16, 1987, he attended the wedding of Helen Nobres and Hilario Bugan at barangay Atbo with several other persons. The two accused were also there, so with victim; that he stayed there up to 4:00 P.M., then he went to Sta. Fe because he had visitors from Manila; that accused Gabriel Caliag is a Lay Pastor of Kalahan Parish serving in Mancate; that on the night of March 16, 1987, he went home at Imugan; early morning of the following day, he was informed that Benjamin Matias was shot dead and the two accused Gabriel Caliag and Alex Oliano were arrested. He was requested to bring the deceased to Bambang Hospital for autopsy examination and the accused were brought to PNP Crime Laboratory, Echague, Isabela for paraffin test. After a month, he happened to pass thru Echague, Isabela and dropped at the PC Crime Laboratory and received xerox copies of the request of Sta. Fe PNP for paraffin examination; receipt of the request and the report of the paraffin examination marked as Exhs. â1â, â1-Bâ and â1-Câ;that the paraffin examination gave negative results; that Gabriel Caliag has a visual problem and he brought him to Dr. Tamesis, President of the Philippines Medical Society for medical examination and he found out that the retina of his eyes are defective; that said accused returned to Dr. Tamesis and secured a medical report (Exh. â2â); that Pastor Rice conducted ocular inspection of the place where the incident happened and he could hardly see a person behind the boulders; and that it was full moon when the crime was committed and the night was bright because of the light from the moon. RAMON OLIANO, testified that he is 62 years old and a resident of Mancate, Villaflores, Sta. Fe, Nueva Viscaya; that on March 16, 1987, he attended the wedding at Atbo and arrived there at 10:00 A.M. and saw his son Alex Oliano at 3:00 P.M. in the wedding. He also saw Gabriel Caliag there. He left the wedding celebration and went home at about 11:00 in the evening with Delia Paraguas, Alex Oliano and several persons from Kalinga-Apayao. When they arrived at home, he slept. Later on, he was awakened by the policemen of Sta Fe because they wanted to talk to his son Alex Oliano. Alex was then sleeping at that time and Sgt. Amlos who was allowed to enter the house allegedly shook Alex and removed his blanket. The policemen took his son with them at the Police Station at Sta. Fe and he continued sleeping. On the following day, he followed his son at the Police Station; that he knows Gabriel Caliag who is a Pastor of the United Church of Christ of the Philippines and that he also knows the victim Benjamin Matias. On cross-examination, he further testified that it was accused Gabriel Caliag who requested him as a witness in this case and not his son Alex; that he learned from Delia Paraguas that his visitors on that night are from Kalinga-Apayao; that he was awakened in his sleep when the policemen knocked at the door of his house but he didnât know what time it was; and that the policemen needed his son Alex because he is one of the suspects in the death of Benjamin Matias.â 22 To prove that he did not use a firearm during the commission of the crime, Oliano presented the result of a paraffin test showing that there was no gunpowder residue (nitrates) on his hands.23 Ruling of the Trial Court In convicting Oliano of murder, the trial court gave credence to the testimony of the widow, Rosita Matias, who positively identified Oliano as the perpetrator. It also held that she could not have been mistaken for the following reasons: first, there was light coming from the moon during the incident; second, the appellant had been her neighbor for a long time; lastly, there was no showing that the widow had a sinister motive to falsely accuse Oliano of a serious crime if it were not the truth. Moreover, the trial court held that her narration in court was corroborated by Basatan, as well as by PFCs Caramat and Flores. It also held that the killing was qualified by treachery. Assignment of Error Appellant imputes this sole error to the trial court: âThe trial court seriously erred in finding the Appellant Alex Oliano guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of murder.â24 The defense argues that Rosita Matias was a biased witness who was âpreconditionedâ25 to name Appellant Oliano as the culprit. Appellant seeks to discredit Rositaâs testimony under the rubric of âpsychological predisposition,â26 by which âpast experiences or situations may act as stimuli that preconditions [sic] the mind and body to think and act in a particular way.â27 In the present case, the stimuli were the remarks made by the appellant against her husband in the presence of other people, which she deemed insulting. Appellant then avers that âon [sic] that fateful moment of the shooting of Benjamin Matias, there was no name most convenient to recall but that of Alex Oliano, the same man who, hours before the incident, had slighted Rosita Matiasâ feelings and whose actuations remained fresh in her thoughts. In so doing, Rosita has consoled herself from the pain of death and vindicated the crime committed against her husband and her family.â28 Appellant also maintains that the widowâs testimony was incredible because she averred that, instead of rendering aid to her fallen husband or seeking refuge, she approached the killer. Appellant also questions the sufficiency of the illumination from the moon which allegedly enabled Mrs. Matias to identify the assailant. This Courtâs Ruling The appeal is not meritorious. Credibility of Witnesses The assessment of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude. Findings of the trial court on such matters are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.29 In the present case, the trial court gave credence to Rositaâs testimony. Appellant failed to present any compelling reason â and we find none -- to overturn the findings of the court a quo. Improper Motive Shorn of its psychological jargon, appellantâs main argument seeks to impute improper motive to the prosecution eyewitness. In simple language, appellant argues that this Court should not believe Rosita because she had a motive to testify falsely against appellant. We are not persuaded. The existence of an ill motive does not automatically render a testimony false or unbelievable. Moreover, the alleged motive -- to avenge the slight perpetrated against her husband â is too paltry a cause for any person to testify falsely against another and cause his incarceration for the most part of his life. Indeed, appellant failed to overcome the presumption that Rosita was not actuated by improper motive, and that her testimony was entitled to full faith and credence.30 Additionally, the fact that Rosita was the wife of the deceased, far from rendering her testimony biased, makes it even more credible, for it is unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime, to accuse somebody other than the real culprit. For her to do so is to let the guilty go free.31 Rosita testified as follows: âQ While you were walking towards your house with your husband ahead of you, as you have just stated, what tra(n)spired next, if anything? A While we were walking on the trail with my husband, I heard one gunshot, sir. Q When you heard this gunshot, what transpired next, if anything? A When I saw the big boulders, I saw ALEX OLIANO there, sir. Q This gunshot which you heard, where did it come from? A It came from the left, at the foot of the boulder, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q And when you heard the shot which according to you came from a big boulder stone, what did you do, if anything? A Upon hearing the gunshot, I shouted and uttered the following, âWHY DID YOU KILL MY HUSBAND WHEN INFACT [sic] HE DID NOT COMMIT ANY FAULT AGAINST YOUâ. Q To whom did you direct those words? A ALEX OLIANO, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q Please describe to the court what you saw? A He was holding his gun in this position (Witness demonstrating). xxx xxx xxx Q After the 2 persons, GABRIEL CALIAG & ALEX OLIANO run [sic] away, what did you do next, if anything? A What I did, I went and embraced my husband because he was then lying, facing the ground, sir. Q What did you observe when you went to succor of your husband? A When I carried him up or lifted him, incidentally, the portion which I touched of his body was then the very portion where he was wounded, sir. Q Please point out where you saw the wound at your own body? A What I saw the wound or bullet entered in this portion (witness indicating a portion of her left back) and exited here (Witness indicating a portion of her right forearms). sir. xxx xxx xxx Q Considering, Madam Witness, before I proceed further, considering that it was night time, will you please inform the court why you were able to see GABRIEL CALIAG and ALEX OLIANO on that night when your husband was shot? A There was a moonlight, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q You said that it was through the light of the moon you were able to recognize ALEX OLIANO & GABRIEL CALIAG, were you able to describe the moon during that night? A Yes, sir, because during that night, I look[ed] up on the sky and it was clear and no clouds and the moon was bright, sir. xxx xxx xxxâ32 During cross-examination, the widow was even more specific in recounting the incident, as follows: âQ And according to your testimony a while ago, your husband was ahead of you of about more than 6-feet, is it not? A Yes, sir. Q And because he was 6-feet ahead of you, so, he would already pass those boulders when the shot rang out? A Yes, sir. He made 3 steps before he fell down. xxx xxx xxx Q And when you saw your husband staggered 3 steps forward of you, you did not immediately go to him or help him but rather you concentrate or focus your attention to where the shot came, is that correct, Madam Witness? A Yes, sir. Q So, at that moment and time, you were more interested where the shot came rather than go and assist your husband which is the natural thing for a wife to do at that moment? A Yes, sir. Q You did not care anymore whether your husband who was staggering forward and falling down needs assistance but rather you better look at the direction where the shot came from? A Yes, sir. Q That is rather unusual conduct on your part, Madam Witness, is it not? A After I saw Alex Oliano, I attended to my husband. Q Now, when the shot rang out, you turned to your left and then look at the boulder, is that correct? A Yes, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q Now, Madam Witness, when you look at the boulder, you mentioned that you saw Alex Oliano, is that correct? A Yes, sir. Q And from where you were standing, he is directly in front of you, correct? A Yes, sir. Q And when you first spotted him, he was not moving, is it not? A He was looking at me. Q He was not moving? A No, sir. Q And from where you were standing directly facing him and holding a gun, that gun was also directly pointed at you when you first saw him, correct? A Yes, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q From your demonstration, what you can see from where you were standing were [sic] only the barrel of the gun, you cannot see anymore the size of the gun, is it not? A I can see the whole because it was only a short firearm. Q When you spotted this Alex Oliano, you said that he was Â½ chin beside/behind the small boulder, is that correct? A Yes, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q And you can only see him up to the chin. The rest of the body was hidden by the boulder, is it not? A I [c]an see the whole body and he was seated. Q And in front of Alex Oliano is a stone, is that correct? A Yes, sir. Q Therefore, the stone hides the lower portion of the body of the accused? A No, sir. Because on the 2 boulders, one is bigger and the other one is smaller. He was sitting on that place and I intentionally looked at him, that is why I saw his entire body. COURT: Q You said before that the pathway which you were walking in going home is much lower than the base of the boulder you have been saying? A Yes, sir. Q And Alex Oliano was crawling behind one of the boulders? A Yes, sir. Q Now, you claimed that you saw the entire body of Alex Oliano? A Yes, sir. Because I peeped at him. [Witness demonstrating by putting her two (2) hands on top of the enclosure of the witness stand.] Q When you said you saw Alex Oliano, you approached him? A Yes, sir. I approached him, then I shouted at him and asked him why he shot my husband when in fact he had no fault committed. Q How near were you when you approached him? A Near. From this place up to that place or 6-feet. Q How wide is that boulder between you? A It is appearing in the picture if you wish to see it. Q When you approached him, your body was immediately being pointed or being touched by the back of the gun? A No sir. Because when I approached him, I do this way. [Witness put her two (2) hands on top of the enclosure of the witness stand.) After which, I shouted at him and asked him why he shot my husband when he did not commit any fault on him. Q Naturally, you went to climb to Alex Oliano because the stone aside from its elevated base is also quite high. A I did not climb anymore because the elevation where the boulder was resting is only this high. [(]Witness indicating the height.[)] And so, I was able to see him. xxx xxx xxxâ33 The foregoing testimony clearly shows that Rosita was present at the locus of the crime, and that she was able to identify the appellant as the assailant. The details of the incident were narrated in such a simple, candid and straightforward manner,34 that they could not have been fabricated or concocted. Moreover, said testimony was corroborated on material points by the testimonies of other witnesses. Prosecution Witness Nancy Basatan averred that she heard a gunshot, followed by the cries of Rosita Matias. She and her husband then rushed to the succor of Rosita and the victim. She further testified that Rosita, while inside their house immediately thereafter, told them that Oliano was the felon. PFCs Samuel Caramat and Bernabe Flores also supported Rositaâs testimony; just after the incident, they heard Rositaâs insistent declarations that Oliano was the killer. Furthermore, credence should be given to Rositaâs account because the medical findings support it.35 Rosita testified that their assailant fired at them from an elevated position. On the witness stand, Dr. Violeta Rumbaua concurred: âFISCAL: Q What could have been the probable position of the victim Benjamin Matias at the time of the infliction of the wounds? A The victim might have been positioned in front and slightly to the right of the assailant, sir. Q What could have been the probable position of the gunman to the victim? A The back of the victim is towards the assailant, sir. FISCAL: Q Now doctor, based on your findings, what could have been the probable position of the assailant when he shot the victim? A The assailant might have been in the position which is higher in elevation than the victim, sir. Q What do you mean higher in elevation? A What I mean is that, the assailant is positioned slightly in lingher [sic] portion that the victim, sir. xxx xxx xxx COURT: Q How did you arrive to [sic] that conclusion doctor? A I based it on the trajectory of the bullets, sir.â36 Testimony of Rosita Matias Credible Appellant asserts that it was incredible that Rosita, who was just shot at and whose companion was dying on the ground, would approach the assailant instead of seeking refuge. It has been held that persons confronted with a strange, startling, or frightful experience have no standard behavioral response.37. Different people react differently to a particular event. What may not seem normal to a person in one circumstance may be perfectly normal to another confronted with the same startling incident.38 Hence, the fact that Rositaâs reaction does not seem natural to some does not destroy her credibility. Lack of Sufficient Illumination Appellant also argues that Rosita could not have seen the killer because the crime was committed at nighttime. He also discredits the testimony that the moon was full on March 16, 1987 when the crime was committed, stating that the calendar presented during the trial showed that the full moon fell on March 15, 1987. It is scarcely necessary to address this puerile argument. Rosita testified that she was able to identify the appellant because of the illumination from the moon. Nancy Basatan,39 Samuel Caramat,40 Delbert Rice41 and Gabriel Callag42 also affirmed that the moon was bright that night. In People vs. Gamboa43 and People vs. Pueblas,44 this Court ruled that illumination from the moon is sufficient for a person to identify another.45 We find pointless appellantâs disquisition on whether the moon was full that night. Indeed, this argument is immaterial. Visibility at nighttime is possible not only at the exact minute and date when the moon is full as indicated in the calendar. In the same way, the nocturnal vision of a person is not necessarily impaired just because the full moon is one day early or late. Negative Result of the Paraffin Test The results of the paraffin test do not exculpate appellant. It has been held that the negative findings of the said test do not conclusively show that he did not discharge a firearm at the time the crime was committed. The absence of nitrates is possible if a person discharged a firearm with gloves on, or if he thoroughly washed his hands thereafter.46 Denial and Alibi Unacceptable Appellant denied any participation in the killing of Matias, contending that he was, at the time, sleeping in the house of his father. This is bereft of merit. For alibi to prosper, it must be shown that it was physically impossible for the appellant to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. In this case, the locus of the crime was only a half kilometer away from the house of appellantâs father. In any event, we cannot accord credence to this defense in the face of the credible and positive identification made by Rosita Matias. Treachery We agree with the trial court that the killing was qualified by treachery. The essence of treachery is a swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim.47 In this case, the victim, totally unaware of his impending death, was walking with his wife when he was shot. He had no weapon with which to defend himself. He had not provoked the appellant; he had no previous altercation or serious misunderstanding with him. These constitute alevosia or treachery48 qualifying the killing to murder. While the information charged that the killing was also aggravated by evident premeditation and use of illegally possessed firearms, the trial court judge did not appreciate these circumstances. The records support his stance. The prosecution failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the killing was attended by these circumstances. Likewise, we cannot appreciate the generic aggravating circumstance of nighttime; while the crime was committed at night, the prosecution failed to show that the appellant sought this circumstance to facilitate the criminal design.49 The penalty for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code50 is reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death. There being no attendant aggravating or mitigating circumstances clearly established during the trial, the mid-range penalty of reclusion perpetua should be imposed upon the appellant. Damages The lower court ordered Oliano to pay the heirs of Benjamin Matias the following amounts: P50,000.00 (stating no reason for the award); P10,000.00 as actual damages and P30,000.00 as moral damages. Consistent with prevailing jurisprudence, we award P50,000.00 to the heirs of Benjamin Matias as indemnity for his untimely demise.51 We cannot, however, sustain the award of actual damages. To seek recovery of actual damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable by the injured party.52 In this case, we find no such proof to sustain the award of actual damages. The prosecution merely presented a bond paper containing a list of the expenses allegedly incurred from the killing to the burial of Benjamin Matias. They did not present any receipt or other evidence to support the claim.53 Nonetheless, appellant should pay the heirs of the deceased temperate damages in the amount of P10,000. Under Article 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages âmay be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty.â Moral damages may be awarded if there is proof of âphysical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury.â54 The prosecution witnesses failed to present proof of any of these circumstances. Hence, we cannot affirm such award by the trial court. WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision is AFFIRMED but the award of actual and moral damages is DELETED. Appellant is ORDERED to pay the heirs of the deceased P50,000 as civil indemnity and P10,000 as temperate damages. Costs against appellant. SO ORDERED.

ALEX OLIANO Y PUGONG AND GABRIEL CALIAG, ACCUSED, ALEX\nOLIANO Y PUGONG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nWell-entrenched in\nour jurisprudence is the rule that findings of trial courts on the credibility\nof witnesses and their testimonies are binding on appellate courts, unless some\nfacts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked,\nmisapprehended or misappreciated which, if considered, will affect the result\nof the case.\n\nThe\nCase\n\nThis is the\ndoctrine applied by the Court in resolving this appeal from the Decision 1 of the Regional Trial Court of\nBayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 30, finding Appellant Alex Oliano y Pugong\nguilty of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua.\n\nProvincial\nFiscal Celerino V. Jandoc filed an Information dated July 22, 1987 before the\nsaid court, accusing appellant, together with one Gabriel Caliag, of murder,\nallegedly committed as follows: âThat on or about the 16th day of\nMarch 1987, in the Municipality of Sta. Fe, Province of Nueva Vizcaya,\nPhilippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the\nabove-named accused Alex P. Oliano and Gabriel C. Caliag, conspiring,\nconfederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully,\nunlawfully and feloniously, by means of treachery and evident premeditation and\nwith intent to kill, attack and assault the person of Benjamin Matias by then and\nthere firing at him with the use of a gun, thereby inflicting upon him mortal\ngunshot wounds, which were the direct and immediate cause of his death and all\nto the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs. Contrary to law with the\naggravating circumstance of having used illegally possessed firearm in\ncommitting the crime.â 2\n\nOn August 12,\n1987, both accused were arraigned in the Kalanguya dialect which they spoke and\nunderstood. Assisted by Counsel Rufino\nLumase, both entered a plea of not guilty. 3 In the\ncourse of the trial which ensued, Gabriel Caliag died. 4 4 For this reason, the court a quo dismissed the case against him. 5\n\nOn July 26,\n1994, the lower court rendered its Decision, 6 the dispositive portion of which reads: âWHEREFORE, finding the accused\nALEX OLIANO guilty of Murder defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the\nRevised Penal Code, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion\nperpetua; to pay the heirs of the victim Benjamin Matias the sum of P50,000.00;\nP10,000.00 as actual damages; and P30,000.00 as moral damages.â 7\n\nThe appellant\nfiled a motion for reconsideration, 8 which however was denied by the trial court in its\norder dated September 15, 1994. 9 Hence, this\nappeal. 10\n\nThe Facts\nVersion of the Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution presented\nsix witnesses, namely: (1) Nancy\nBasatan, 11 a neighbor of the deceased; (2) Rosita Matias, 12 the widow; (3) PFCs Samuel Caramat 13 and (4) Bernabe Flores, 14 the investigating and arresting\nofficers; (5) Myrna Matias, 15 the daughter of the victim; and (6)\nDra. Violeta Rumbaua, 16 who conducted the autopsy. The antecedent facts, culled from the testimonies of the\nprosecution witnesses, were briefly summarized by the solicitor general as\nfollows: âOn March 16, 1987, Benjamin Matias\nand his wife, Rosita, attended the wedding of Helen Nebres and Hilario Bugan in\nthe house of Hindok Nebres at Sitio Taktak, Barangay Atbo, Sta. Fe, Nueva\nVizcaya. Among those who attended the\nwedding were accused Gabriel Caliag and Alex Oliano. While serving supper, Rosita heard Alex say âIf it is Benjamin\nMatias who will give meat, I will not accept it.â Benjamin Matias was then busy\nslicing meat for the guests. At about\n11:45 that evening, Rosita and Benjamin went home. The distance of their house from that of the Nebresâ was about\none-half kilometer. Benjamin walked\nahead of Rosita. (x x x) It happened that there were two\nboulders located on the left side of the road leading to the coupleâs\nhouse. When they were only about a\nmeter away from the boulders, somebody fired a gun at Benjamin hitting him at\nthe back, the bullet exiting through his chest. Rosita then saw appellant Alex Oliano behind the boulders,\nholding a rifle. At that instance,\nRosita uttered the following to appellant: âWhy did you kill my husband when in fact, he did not commit any fault\nagainst you?â Subsequently, appellant\naimed his gun at her but it jammed. Rosita also saw the other accused Gabriel Caliag looking at her from\nbehind a banana plant. Alex and Gabriel\nthen ran away towards the mountain. Rosita went to her husband who was then lying face down on the ground\nand embraced him. The moon was bright\nthat night, thus enabling Rosita to easily recognize appellant and his\nco-accused. Rosita is also familiar\nwith appellant since he was 17 years old because they were neighbors. (x x x) Rosita called for help and her\nneighbor, Nancy Basatan came. The\nlatter asked Rosita what happened. Rosita answered, âAlex Oliano shot my husband when we did not have any\nfault against him.â Later, her children,\nnamely Ricardo, Edgar, and Dencio arrived together with two Barangay Captains\nDay-an Celo and Peter. Her children\nwanted to retaliate against Alex but she calmed them down. Several policemen also arrived and she\nexplained to them how the incident happened. Station Commander Mariano Amlos then formed two groups of policemen,\nwhom he directed to go to the houses of appellant and Caliag. Moments later, Bay-an Basatan arrived and\ntold Rosita to go to his house. Rosita\nwent to his house and there saw both appellant and Gabriel Caliag. Upon seeing appellant, she grabbed his\ncollar and said âYou were the one who killed my husband.â Appellant cried and replied, âYou are even attending\nmass.â Caliag, on the other hand,\nlooked happy, and even played the guitar. Both of them were then brought to the police station in Sta. Fe, Nueva\nVizcaya. (x x x)â 17\n\nThe result of\nthe post-mortem examination 18 reads: âI - EXTERNAL FINDINGS: A - Head and Neck: No significant findings. B - Chest: Gunshot wound, through and through Point of Entry - 0.8 cm. diameter\nwith charred edges at 7th Intercostal Space, Midscapular line, left. Point of Exit - 2 cm. long with\nrugged edges 2.5 cm. medial to midclavicular, 5th Intercostalspace space,\nright. C - Abdomen: { No significant findings.

C - Abdomen: - no significant\nfindings. D - Extremities: - No significant\nfindings. III - CAUSE OF DEATH: Cardiac Arrest due to Gunshot wound\non the Heart.â 19\n\nVersion of the Defense\n\nThe defense\npresented Accused Gabriel Caliag 20 and Appellant Alex Oliano 21 as main witnesses. In his Brief\ndated November 29, 1995, appellant adopted the trial courtâs summary of the\ntestimony of the defense witnesses, viz.: âx x x. On March 16, 1987 at 10:00 A.M., he was at Tactac, Sta. Fe, Nueva\nVizcaya to deliver rattan to a buyer. Then he went to Ocao to attend the wedding celebration and stayed there\nfor more than 5 hours. He left the\nwedding at about 11:00 in the evening together with his father, mother, sister\nand students of Kalahan Academy and proceeded to the house of his father Ramon\nOliano at Mancate, which is about 1/2 kilometer from the wedding celebration\nand arrived thereat 11:30 in the evening, then he slept on a folding bed in the\ncorner of the house. At 2:00 in the\nmorning, he was awakened by the policemen of Sta. Fe. Sgt. Amlos removed his blanket and awakened him and he wanted to\ntalk to him. When he woke up, he saw\nPetra, Delia Paraguas and his mother sitted [sic] on a bench. Sgt. Amlos told him about the death of\nBenjamin Matias at Mancate and asked him as to who are his companions in coming\nfrom the wedding celebration and he told the police that his companion is a\nperson named Benito. The policemen\ninvited him to go with them but he intended not to go but his father advised\nhim to go with them, so they proceeded to the house of Pay-an Basatan about 600\nmeters away. Later on, Rosita Matias\nand some policemen arrived. Gabriel\nCaliag was also there sitted [sic] in a chair. Rosita Matias pointed to them as the killers of her husband. Later on,\nthe two accused together with the policemen went to Sta. Fe and the accused were locked in jail for two\nhours. Then they were brought to the\nPNP Crime Laboratory, Echague, Isabela for paraffin examination. After the examination, the policemen\nreturned them to Sta. Fe; that it is not true that they killed Benjamin Matias. x\nx x.â âDELBERT RICE, a Pastor of the\nChristian Kalahan Parish, testified that he had personally known the two\naccused for 25 years because they are his students in the Kalahan Academy; that\nhe also knows the victim being a member of their congregation in Mancate and\nhis compadre; that on March 16, 1987, he attended the wedding of Helen Nobres\nand Hilario Bugan at barangay Atbo with several other persons. The two accused were also there, so with\nvictim; that he stayed there up to 4:00 P.M., then he went to Sta. Fe because\nhe had visitors from Manila; that accused Gabriel Caliag is a Lay Pastor of\nKalahan Parish serving in Mancate; that on the night of March 16, 1987, he went\nhome at Imugan; early morning of the following day, he was informed that\nBenjamin Matias was shot dead and the two accused Gabriel Caliag and Alex\nOliano were arrested. He was requested\nto bring the deceased to Bambang Hospital for autopsy examination and the\naccused were brought to PNP Crime Laboratory, Echague, Isabela for paraffin\ntest. After a month, he happened to\npass thru Echague, Isabela and dropped at the PC Crime Laboratory and received\nxerox copies of the request of Sta. Fe PNP for paraffin examination; receipt of\nthe request and the report of the paraffin examination marked as Exhs. â1â,\nâ1-Bâ and â1-Câ;that the paraffin examination gave negative results; that\nGabriel Caliag has a visual problem and he brought him to Dr. Tamesis,\nPresident of the Philippines Medical Society for medical examination and he\nfound out that the retina of his eyes are defective; that said accused returned\nto Dr. Tamesis and secured a medical report (Exh. â2â); that Pastor Rice\nconducted ocular inspection of the place where the incident happened and he\ncould hardly see a person behind the boulders; and that it was full moon when\nthe crime was committed and the night was bright because of the light from the\nmoon. RAMON OLIANO, testified that he is\n62 years old and a resident of Mancate, Villaflores, Sta. Fe, Nueva Viscaya;\nthat on March 16, 1987, he attended the wedding at Atbo and arrived there at\n10:00 A.M. and saw his son Alex Oliano at 3:00 P.M. in the wedding. He also saw Gabriel Caliag there. He left the wedding celebration and went\nhome at about 11:00 in the evening with Delia Paraguas, Alex Oliano and several\npersons from Kalinga-Apayao. When they\narrived at home, he slept. Later on, he\nwas awakened by the policemen of Sta Fe because they wanted to talk to his son\nAlex Oliano. Alex was then sleeping at\nthat time and Sgt. Amlos who was allowed to enter the house allegedly shook\nAlex and removed his blanket. The\npolicemen took his son with them at the Police Station at Sta. Fe and he\ncontinued sleeping. On the following\nday, he followed his son at the Police Station; that he knows Gabriel Caliag\nwho is a Pastor of the United Church of Christ of the Philippines and that he\nalso knows the victim Benjamin Matias. On cross-examination, he further\ntestified that it was accused Gabriel Caliag who requested him as a witness in\nthis case and not his son Alex; that he learned from Delia Paraguas that his\nvisitors on that night are from Kalinga-Apayao; that he was awakened in his\nsleep when the policemen knocked at the door of his house but he didnât know\nwhat time it was; and that the policemen needed his son Alex because he is one\nof the suspects in the death of Benjamin Matias.â 22\n\nTo prove that he\ndid not use a firearm during the commission of the crime, Oliano presented the\nresult of a paraffin test showing that\nthere was no gunpowder residue (nitrates) on his hands. 23\n\nRuling\nof the Trial Court\n\nIn convicting\nOliano of murder, the trial court gave credence to the testimony of the widow,\nRosita Matias, who positively identified Oliano as the perpetrator. It also held that she could not have been\nmistaken for the following reasons: first, there was light coming from the moon\nduring the incident; second, the appellant had been her neighbor for a long\ntime; lastly, there was no showing that the widow had a sinister motive to\nfalsely accuse Oliano of a serious crime if it were not the truth. Moreover, the trial court held that her\nnarration in court was corroborated by Basatan, as well as by PFCs Caramat and\nFlores. It also held that the killing\nwas qualified by treachery.\n\nAssignment\nof Error\n\nAppellant\nimputes this sole error to the trial court: âThe trial court seriously erred in\nfinding the Appellant Alex Oliano guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime\nof murder.â 24 The defense argues that Rosita\nMatias was a biased witness who was âpreconditionedâ 25 to name Appellant Oliano as the culprit. Appellant seeks to discredit Rositaâs testimony under the rubric\nof âpsychological predisposition,â 26 by which âpast experiences or situations may act as stimuli\nthat preconditions [sic] the mind and body to think and act in a particular\nway.â 27 In the\npresent case, the stimuli were the remarks made by the appellant against her\nhusband in the presence of other people, which she deemed insulting. Appellant then avers that âon [sic] that\nfateful moment of the shooting of Benjamin Matias, there was no name most\nconvenient to recall but that of Alex Oliano, the same man who, hours before\nthe incident, had slighted Rosita Matiasâ feelings and whose actuations remained\nfresh in her thoughts. In so doing,\nRosita has consoled herself from the pain of death and vindicated the crime\ncommitted against her husband and her family.â 28\n\nAppellant also\nmaintains that the widowâs testimony was incredible because she averred that,\ninstead of rendering aid to her fallen husband or seeking refuge, she\napproached the killer. Appellant also\nquestions the sufficiency of the illumination from the moon which allegedly\nenabled Mrs. Matias to identify the assailant.\n\nThis\nCourtâs Ruling\n\nThe appeal is\nnot meritorious.\n\nCredibility\nof Witnesses\n\nThe assessment\nof the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best\nundertaken by the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the\nwitnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude. Findings of the trial court on such matters\nare binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless some facts or\ncircumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or\nmisinterpreted. 29 In the\npresent case, the trial court gave credence to Rositaâs testimony. Appellant failed to present any compelling\nreason â and we find none -- to\noverturn the findings of the court a quo.\n\nImproper\nMotive\n\nShorn of its psychological\njargon, appellantâs main argument seeks to impute improper motive to the\nprosecution eyewitness. In simple language, appellant argues that this Court\nshould not believe Rosita because she had a motive to testify falsely against\nappellant. We are not persuaded. The existence of an ill motive does not\nautomatically render a testimony false or unbelievable. Moreover, the alleged motive -- to avenge the slight perpetrated against her\nhusband â is too paltry a cause for any person to testify falsely against\nanother and cause his incarceration for the most part of his life. Indeed, appellant failed to overcome the\npresumption that Rosita was not actuated by improper motive, and that her\ntestimony was entitled to full faith and credence. 30\n\nAdditionally,\nthe fact that Rosita was the wife of the deceased, far from rendering her\ntestimony biased, makes it even more credible, for it is unnatural for a\nrelative who is interested in vindicating the crime, to accuse somebody other\nthan the real culprit. For her to do so\nis to let the guilty go free. 31\n\nRosita testified\nas follows: âQ While\nyou were walking towards your house with your husband ahead of you, as you have\njust stated, what tra(n)spired next, if anything? A While\nwe were walking on the trail with my husband, I heard one gunshot, sir. Q When\nyou heard this gunshot, what transpired next, if anything? A When\nI saw the big boulders, I saw ALEX OLIANO there, sir. Q This\ngunshot which you heard, where did it come from? A It\ncame from the left, at the foot of the boulder, sir. xxx xxx xxx Q And\nwhen you heard the shot which according to you came from a big boulder stone,\nwhat did you do, if anything? A Upon\nhearing the gunshot, I shouted and uttered the following, âWHY DID YOU KILL MY\nHUSBAND WHEN INFACT [sic] HE DID NOT COMMIT ANY FAULT AGAINST YOUâ. Q To\nwhom did you direct those words? A ALEX\nOLIANO, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q Please\ndescribe to the court what you saw? A He\nwas holding his gun in this position (Witness demonstrating).\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q After\nthe 2 persons, GABRIEL CALIAG & ALEX OLIANO run [sic] away, what did you do\nnext, if anything? A What\nI did, I went and embraced my husband because he was then lying, facing the\nground, sir. Q What\ndid you observe when you went to succor of your husband? A When\nI carried him up or lifted him, incidentally, the portion which I touched of\nhis body was then the very portion where he was wounded, sir. Q Please\npoint out where you saw the wound at your own body? A What\nI saw the wound or bullet entered in this portion (witness indicating a portion\nof her left back) and exited here (Witness indicating a portion of her right\nforearms). sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q Considering,\nMadam Witness, before I proceed further, considering that it was night time,\nwill you please inform the court why you were able to see GABRIEL CALIAG and\nALEX OLIANO on that night when your husband was shot? A There\nwas a moonlight, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q You\nsaid that it was through the light of the moon you were able to recognize ALEX\nOLIANO & GABRIEL CALIAG, were you able to describe the moon during that\nnight? A Yes,\nsir, because during that night, I look[ed] up on the sky and it was clear and\nno clouds and the moon was bright, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxxâ 32 During cross-examination, the widow\nwas even more specific in recounting the incident, as follows: âQ And\naccording to your testimony a while ago, your husband was ahead of you of about\nmore than 6-feet, is it not? A Yes,\nsir. Q And\nbecause he was 6-feet ahead of you, so, he would already pass those boulders\nwhen the shot rang out? A Yes,\nsir. He made 3 steps before he fell\ndown.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q And\nwhen you saw your husband staggered 3 steps forward of you, you did not\nimmediately go to him or help him but rather you concentrate or focus your\nattention to where the shot came, is that correct, Madam Witness? A Yes,\nsir. Q So,\nat that moment and time, you were more interested where the shot came rather\nthan go and assist your husband which is the natural thing for a wife to do at\nthat moment? A Yes,\nsir. Q You\ndid not care anymore whether your husband who was staggering forward and\nfalling down needs assistance but rather you better look at the direction where\nthe shot came from? A Yes,\nsir. Q That\nis rather unusual conduct on your part, Madam Witness, is it not? A After\nI saw Alex Oliano, I attended to my husband. Q Now,\nwhen the shot rang out, you turned to your left and then look at the boulder,\nis that correct? A Yes,\nsir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q Now,\nMadam Witness, when you look at the boulder, you mentioned that you saw Alex\nOliano, is that correct? A Yes,\nsir. Q And\nfrom where you were standing, he is directly in front of you, correct? A Yes,\nsir. Q And\nwhen you first spotted him, he was not moving, is it not? A He\nwas looking at me. Q He\nwas not moving? A No,\nsir. Q And\nfrom where you were standing directly facing him and holding a gun, that gun\nwas also directly pointed at you when you first saw him, correct? A Yes,\nsir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q From\nyour demonstration, what you can see from where you were standing were [sic]\nonly the barrel of the gun, you cannot see anymore the size of the gun, is it\nnot? A I\ncan see the whole because it was only a short firearm. Q When\nyou spotted this Alex Oliano, you said that he was Â½ chin beside/behind the\nsmall boulder, is that correct? A Yes,\nsir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx Q And\nyou can only see him up to the chin. The rest of the body was hidden by the boulder, is it not? A I\n[c]an see the whole body and he was seated. Q And\nin front of Alex Oliano is a stone, is that correct? A Yes,\nsir. Q Therefore,\nthe stone hides the lower portion of the body of the accused? A No,\nsir. Because on the 2 boulders, one is\nbigger and the other one is smaller. He\nwas sitting on that place and I intentionally looked at him, that is why I saw\nhis entire body. COURT: Q You\nsaid before that the pathway which you were walking in going home is much lower\nthan the base of the boulder you have been saying? A Yes,\nsir. Q And\nAlex Oliano was crawling behind one of\nthe boulders? A Yes,\nsir. Q Now,\nyou claimed that you saw the entire body of Alex Oliano? A Yes,\nsir. Because I peeped at him. [Witness demonstrating by putting her two\n(2) hands on top of the enclosure of the witness stand.] Q When\nyou said you saw Alex Oliano, you approached him? A Yes,\nsir. I approached him, then I shouted\nat him and asked him why he shot my husband when in fact he had no fault\ncommitted. Q How\nnear were you when you approached him? A Near. From this place up to that place or 6-feet. Q How\nwide is that boulder between you? A It\nis appearing in the picture if you wish to see it. Q When\nyou approached him, your body was immediately being pointed or being touched by\nthe back of the gun? A No\nsir. Because when I approached him, I\ndo this way. [Witness put her two (2) hands on top of the enclosure of the\nwitness stand.) After which, I shouted\nat him and asked him why he shot my husband when he did not commit any fault on\nhim. Q Naturally,\nyou went to climb to Alex Oliano because the stone aside from its elevated base\nis also quite high. A I\ndid not climb anymore because the elevation where the boulder was resting is\nonly this high. [(]Witness indicating\nthe height.[)] And so, I was able to\nsee him.\n\nxxx xxx xxxâ 33\n\nThe foregoing\ntestimony clearly shows that Rosita was present at the locus of the crime, and\nthat she was able to identify the appellant as the assailant. The details of the incident were narrated in\nsuch a simple, candid and straightforward manner, 34 that they could not have been fabricated or concocted.\n\nMoreover, said\ntestimony was corroborated on material points by the testimonies of other\nwitnesses. Prosecution Witness Nancy\nBasatan averred that she heard a gunshot, followed by the cries of Rosita Matias.\n\nShe and her\nhusband then rushed to the succor of Rosita and the victim. She further testified that Rosita, while\ninside their house immediately thereafter, told them that Oliano was the felon. PFCs Samuel Caramat and Bernabe Flores also\nsupported Rositaâs testimony; just after the incident, they heard Rositaâs\ninsistent declarations that Oliano was the killer.\n\nFurthermore,\ncredence should be given to Rositaâs account because the medical findings\nsupport it. 35 Rosita\ntestified that their assailant fired at them from an elevated position. On the witness stand, Dr. Violeta Rumbaua\nconcurred: âFISCAL: Q What\ncould have been the probable position of the victim Benjamin Matias at the time\nof the infliction of the wounds? A The\nvictim might have been positioned in front and slightly to the right of the\nassailant, sir. Q What\ncould have been the probable position of the gunman to the victim? A The\nback of the victim is towards the assailant, sir. FISCAL: Q Now\ndoctor, based on your findings, what could have been the probable position of\nthe assailant when he shot the victim? A The\nassailant might have been in the position which is higher in elevation than the\nvictim, sir. Q What\ndo you mean higher in elevation? A What\nI mean is that, the assailant is positioned slightly in lingher [sic] portion\nthat the victim, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx COURT: Q How\ndid you arrive to [sic] that conclusion doctor? A I\nbased it on the trajectory of the bullets, sir.â 36\n\nTestimony\nof Rosita Matias Credible\n\nAppellant\nasserts that it was incredible that Rosita, who was just shot at and whose\ncompanion was dying on the ground, would approach the assailant instead of\nseeking refuge. It has been held that\npersons confronted with a strange, startling, or frightful experience have no\nstandard behavioral response. 37 . Different\npeople react differently to a particular event. What may not seem normal to a person in one circumstance may be\nperfectly normal to another confronted with the same startling incident. 38 Hence, the fact that Rositaâs reaction does not seem natural to some\ndoes not destroy her credibility.\n\nLack\nof Sufficient Illumination\n\nAppellant also\nargues that Rosita could not have seen the killer because the crime was\ncommitted at nighttime. He also\ndiscredits the testimony that the moon was full on March 16, 1987 when the\ncrime was committed, stating that the calendar presented during the trial\nshowed that the full moon fell on March 15, 1987.\n\nIt is scarcely\nnecessary to address this puerile argument. Rosita testified that she was able to identify the appellant because of\nthe illumination from the moon. Nancy\nBasatan, 39 Samuel Caramat, 40 Delbert Rice 41 and Gabriel Callag 42 also affirmed that the moon was\nbright that night. In People vs. Gamboa 43 and People vs. Pueblas, 44 this Court ruled that illumination\nfrom the moon is sufficient for a person to identify another. 45 We find pointless appellantâs disquisition on whether the moon was full\nthat night. Indeed, this argument is immaterial. Visibility at nighttime is possible not only\nat the exact minute and date when the moon is full as indicated in the\ncalendar. In the same way, the\nnocturnal vision of a person is not necessarily impaired just because the full\nmoon is one day early or late.\n\nNegative\nResult of the Paraffin Test\n\nThe results of\nthe paraffin test do not exculpate appellant. It has been held that the negative findings of the said test do not\nconclusively show that he did not discharge a firearm at the time the crime was\ncommitted. The absence of nitrates is possible\nif a person discharged a firearm with gloves on, or if he thoroughly washed his\nhands thereafter. 46\n\nDenial\nand Alibi Unacceptable\n\nAppellant denied\nany participation in the killing of Matias, contending that he was, at the\ntime, sleeping in the house of his\nfather. This is bereft of merit. For alibi to prosper, it must be shown that it was physically\nimpossible for the appellant to have been at the scene of the crime at the time\nof its commission. In this case, the\nlocus of the crime was only a half kilometer away from the house of appellantâs\nfather. In any event, we cannot accord\ncredence to this defense in the face of the credible and positive\nidentification made by Rosita Matias.\n\nTreachery\n\nWe agree with\nthe trial court that the killing was qualified by treachery. The essence of treachery is a swift and\nunexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the\npart of the victim. 47 In this\ncase, the victim, totally unaware of his impending death, was walking with his\nwife when he was shot. He had no weapon\nwith which to defend himself. He had\nnot provoked the appellant; he had no previous altercation or serious\nmisunderstanding with him. These\nconstitute alevosia or treachery 48 qualifying the killing to murder.\n\nWhile the\ninformation charged that the killing was also aggravated by evident\npremeditation and use of illegally possessed firearms, the trial court judge\ndid not appreciate these circumstances. The records support his stance. The prosecution failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the\nkilling was attended by these circumstances. Likewise, we cannot appreciate\nthe generic aggravating circumstance of nighttime; while the crime was committed at night, the prosecution failed to\nshow that the appellant sought this circumstance to facilitate the criminal\ndesign. 49\n\nThe penalty for\nmurder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code 50 is reclusion temporal in its\nmaximum period to death. There being no\nattendant aggravating or mitigating circumstances clearly established during\nthe trial, the mid-range penalty of reclusion perpetua should be imposed upon\nthe appellant.\n\nDamages\n\nThe lower court\nordered Oliano to pay the heirs of Benjamin Matias the following amounts:\nP50,000.00 (stating no reason for the award); P10,000.00 as actual damages and\nP30,000.00 as moral damages.\n\nConsistent with\nprevailing jurisprudence, we award P50,000.00 to the heirs of Benjamin Matias\nas indemnity for his untimely demise. 51\n\nWe cannot,\nhowever, sustain the award of actual damages. To seek recovery of actual\ndamages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable\ndegree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence\nobtainable by the injured party. 52 In this\ncase, we find no such proof to sustain the award of actual damages. The prosecution merely presented a bond\npaper containing a list of the expenses allegedly incurred from the killing to\nthe burial of Benjamin Matias. They did\nnot present any receipt or other evidence to support the claim. 53 Nonetheless, appellant should pay the heirs of the deceased temperate\ndamages in the amount of P10,000. Under\nArticle 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages âmay be recovered when the\ncourt finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot,\nfrom the nature of the case, be proved with certainty.â\n\nMoral damages\nmay be awarded if there is proof of âphysical suffering, mental anguish,\nfright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social\nhumiliation, and similar injury.â 54 The\nprosecution witnesses failed to present proof of any of these\ncircumstances. Hence, we cannot affirm\nsuch award by the trial court.\n\nWHEREFORE, the assailed\nDecision is AFFIRMED but the award of actual and moral damages is DELETED.\nAppellant is ORDERED to pay the heirs of the deceased P50,000 as civil\nindemnity and P10,000 as temperate damages.
