Nos. 120387-88, March 31, 1998 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. EDUARDO GARCIA Y DULAY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. EDUARDO GARCIA Y DULAY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nAffidavits of\ndesistance, especially those extracted from poor, unlettered, young and\ngullible witnesses long after the trial is over, are generally frowned\nupon. Testimony solemnly given before a\ncourt of justice and subjected to the test of cross-examination cannot just be\nset aside, and a new trial granted on the basis of perfunctory and pro forma affidavits that\nobviously were not prepared directly by the witnesses themselves but by some\nlegally trained individuals. The\ncredibility of trials and the pursuit of truth cannot be placed at the\nunilateral disposal of timorous witnesses or made dependent on one-sided\nstatements prepared by notaries.\n\nThe Case\n\nThe Court relies\nupon this principium in resolving this appeal from the Decision [1] . It was penned by Judge Lorenzo B. Veneracion, who also presided\nover the trial. 1 of the\nRegional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XLVII, convicting Appellant Eduardo\nGarcia of two counts of rape and sentencing him to two terms of reclusion\nperpetua . Appellant prays that he\nâbe acquitted and/or the case be remanded to the lower court for reception of\nnewly discovered evidence.â [2]\n\nOn January 6,\n1993, Complainant Joylyn Garcia, accompanied and assisted by her sister Rowena\nand aunt Librada Nuqui, [3] lodged before the Manila Police a\ncomplaint for rape against her father, Appellant Eduardo Garcia.\n\nAfter\npreliminary investigation, two separate Informations, docketed as Criminal Case\nNos. 93-114437 and 93-114438 and both dated January 8, 1993, were filed by\nAssistant Prosecutor Ferrer S. Co charging appellant with rape. The Information in Criminal Case No.\n93-114437 reads: âThat sometime in the\nmiddle part of October 1992, in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said\naccused, armed with a bladed weapon, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously, with lewd designs have carnal knowledge of JOYLYN GARCIA Y NUQUI,\nwho is his daughter age 13 years, and by means of force, violence, threat and\nintimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, against her will\nand consent. CONTRARY\nTO LAW.â [4]\n\nExcept for the\ndate of the commission of the crime, the Information in Criminal Case No.\n93-114438 was similar to the first: âThat sometime in the 2nd\nweek of November 1992, in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said accused,\narmed with a bladed weapon, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously, with lewd designs have carnal knowledge of JOYLYN GARCIA Y NUQUI,\nwho is his daughter age 13 years, and by means of force, violence, threat and\nintimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, against her will\nand consent. CONTRARY\nTO LAW.â [5]\n\nDuring\narraignment, accused-appellant, assisted by Counsel de Oficio Jesse\nTiburan, pleaded not guilty to both charges. [6] The trial court consolidated the\ntwo cases and, after due trial, promulgated on August 9, 1994 its assailed\nDecision, [7] the dispositive portion of which\nreads: âWHEREFORE, judgment is\nhereby rendered finding [the] accused, Eduardo Garcia y Dulay, guilty beyond\nreasonable doubt of the crime of rape on two counts and hereby sentences him to\nsuffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count of rape charged\nin the Informations in these cases. The accused is further\nordered to indemnify the victim, Joylyn Garcia y Nuqui the sum of P 100,000.00,\nPhilippine Currency. SO\nORDERED.â [8]\n\nHence, this\nappeal. [9] After the promulgation of the\nassailed Decision, appellant filed before the trial court a motion for a new\ntrial. In its order dated April 21,\n1995, the court a quo held that âthe Motion for New Trial should be\naddressed to the Supreme Court.â [10]\n\nThe Facts\n\nAccording to the Prosecution\n\nIn the\nAppelleeâs Brief, [11] dated May 30, 1996, the solicitor\ngeneral presented the prosecutionâs version of the case facts: âThe victim, Joylyn Garcia,\na first year student at the Nolasco High School in Tondo, Manila, testified\nthat sometime in the middle of October, 1992, about 9:00 oâclock in the\nevening, appellant Eduardo Garcia, her father, gave her medicine for her\nillness. At the time, Joylyn was lying\nin bed (TSN, p. 3, February 9, 1993). After Joylyn took the\nmedicine which caused her to sleep, appellant placed himself on top of Joylyn\nand poked a pointed object on her right side. Appellant then held her arms, spread her knees (legs) and inserted his\npenis into her vagina. Appellant remained\nin that position for about three (3) minutes after which he left the\nhouse. After the incident, Joylyn\nreported her ordeal to Librada Nuqui, her auntie (TSN, pp. 4-5, February 9,\n1993). Joylyn continued that\nsometime in the second week of November, 1992, also in the evening, she was\nagain raped by her father when they were left alone in their house. She likewise reported the incident to her\nauntie (TSN, pp. 6-7, February 9, 1993). The records show that after\nthe incidents were reported to the City Hall Detachment, Joylyn was examined by Dr. Manuel Lagonera,\nmedico-legal officer of the Western Police District Command (WPDC). His findings were contained in Report No.\nWB-93-01 (Exh. âGâ) dated February 12, 1993, thus:\n\nPHYSICAL AND\nVAGINAL EXAMINATION REPORT GENERAL DATA: âJoylyn N. Garcia, 13 years\nold, single, presently residing at 362-B Sta. Isabel St., Bo. San Antonio,\nZaragosa, Tondo, Manila, consulted the medico-legal office on 5 January 1993 at\nabout 8:45 p.m. accompanied by aunt and sister for physical and vaginal\nexamination as requested by Chief Insp. Honorato Laurel of GAD, WPD.â\n\nGENERAL\nAPPEARANCE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Fairly nourished and fairly\ndeveloped, conscious but incoherent. Mentally unstable with slurred speech. Breasts - Hemi-spherical in\nshape with brownish nipples and areolae. Abdomen - soft and flat\nwithout strae [sic] of pregnancy. Vaginal canal - admits one\nexamining finger with resistance and moist. Hymen -\nthin with circular opening and showed incomplete and superficial healed\nlaceration at 3:00 oâclock position with non-coaptable edges and not congested.\n\nIMPRESSION/CONCLUSION: Consistent with a girl who is no longer a virgin.â [12]\n\nScenario of the Defense\n\nThe defense\nclaims that appellant did not commit the crime charged. It also prays for a new trial for the\nreception of newly discovered evidence consisting of the complainantâs\nAffidavit of Desistance, [13] in which she recanted her testimony\nthat she was raped by her father. The\nAppellantâs Brief [14] narrates the facts as viewed by the\ndefense: âTwo Informations for two\ncounts of rape were filed against the [a]ccused by his daughter, Joylyn\nGarcia[,] allegedly committed [i]n the middle part of October 1992 and November\n1992 in their residence in Tondo, Manila. Complainant was assisted by\nher sister, Rowena Garcia and her [a]untie, Librada Nuqui when they lodged a\ncomplaint in the police detachment, at the ground floor of Manila City Hall\nsometime on January 6, 1993. Thereafter,\naccused was arrested and until now, he is detained at the Muntinlupa\nPenitentiary. The wife (mother of\ncomplainant), brother and grandmother of the complainant testified for the\n[a]ccused while the sister, Rowena Garcia and their [a]untie, Librada Nuqui\ninitiated this criminal case. There was\ninternal family feud, which furnishes the motive for this charge. Complainant was a thirteen\n(13) year old high school student at the time of the incident. Beginning June 1992 up to November 11, 1992,\nshe was staying at the residence of her [a]untie. (T.S.N. of Feb. 23, 1993, p. 7). She was brought to their house on November 11, 1992 already in a state\nof shock (tulala) and mumbling incoherently. She was treated by a quack doctor. Later[,] she mumbled that she was touched and was being threatened. (Naagrabyado, T.S.N. of 2/23/95, p. 9). Under the pitiful and pathetic situation,\nthe [a]ccused, together with his wife, brought their aforesaid daughter, Joylyn\nGarcia to the hospital for psychiatric treatment (Exhibit â1â). In December 1992, the mother\nand wife of the [a]ccused brought their daughter to Phil. General Hospital for\ntreatment. (Exhibit â2â, â3-Aâ, â3-Bâ). For the prosecution,\n[c]omplainant took the witness [stand] and the doctor who examined her. (Exhibit âFâ and âF-1â). For the defense, the [a]ccused denied that\nhe raped his own daughter. The wife\ntestified for the [a]ccused and averred that they were sidewalk vendors in\nDivisoria, Manila and usually arrived home together at about 8:00 p.m. or 9:00\np.m. and usually left at the wee hour of day at about 3:00 a.m. The defense presented Dr. Agueda Sunga and\nDra. Anita Poblete of PGH who examined the accused and found her hymen to be\nstill intact. The brother of the\n[c]omplainant likewise testified that his father could not have raped his\nsister. After trial, Judge\nVeneracion rendered the disputed decision finding the [a]ccused guilty beyond\nreasonable doubt of two counts of rape. While the case is on\nappeal, [c]omplainant executed an Affidavit of Desistance dated November 25,\n1995 before the undersigned counsel, recanting her previous testimony and\napologized for the grievous mistake in accusing her father. In view of the recantation of said\ncomplainant, [a]ccused filed a Motion for New Trial based on newly discovered\nevidence but the lower court denied the said motion, contained [sic] in an\nOrder dated April 21, 1995 reasoning that âThe Court feels that the Motion for\nNew Trial should be addressed to the Supreme Court.â This\n[a]ppeal is interposed to reverse the finding of the lower court on the ground\nthat the guilt of the [a]ccused has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt,\nand/or based on constitutional presumption of innocence which has not been\novercome especially in the light of the inconsistent testimony of the\ncomplainant and her subsequent recantation.â [15]\n\nJoylyn Garciaâs\naffidavit reads: âAFFIDAVIT OF DESISTANCE I, Joylyn Garcia, Filipino,\nsingle, of legal age, with postal address at 362-B Sta. Isabel St., Barrio San\nAntonio, Tondo, Manila, after being duly sworn, hereby depose under oath that: 1. I am the complainant against my father, Eduardo Garcia for rape\nunder criminal case nos. 93-114437, 93-114438, RTC of Manila, Branch 47; 2. I retract my previous testimony in court that I was raped twice by\nmy father, Eduardo Garcia sometime in October and November 1992. It is not true that my father, Eduardo\nGarcia, raped me at our house. I\napologize for the grievuous [sic] mistake in accusing my father ; 3. The filing of the criminal case was upon instruction of my\n[a]untie, Roselle Nuqui and my sister, Rowena Garcia. At that time, I was still in shock and suffering from nervuous\n[sic] breakdown. I had no mind of my\nown. I testified in court pursuant to\nwhat was dictated upon me by my said relatives. 4. This affidavit is executed to nullify the decision convicting\nmy father of the crime of rape and to set free my father who was innocent of\nthe crime of rape. I execute this affidavit to\nattest to the truth of the foregoing for whatever legal purpose it may serve.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto\nset my hand this ___ day of October 1994 at Manila, Philippines. (SGD.) JOYLYN GARCIA Affiantâ [16]\n\nIssues\n\nIn his Brief,\nappellant assigns the following âerrors committed by the lower courtâ: âI. The information is fatally defective as the same was not signed\nor assisted by the parents;[sic] II. The accused should be acquitted as the constitutional\npresumption of innocence has not been overcome; III. The alleged rape is [a] figment of imagination and is not\ncredible; and IV. New hearing should be held for [the]\nreception of newly discovered evidence in view of the recantation of the\ncomplainant.â [17]\n\nThe Court, in\nthe interest of clarity, will combine the foregoing into two issues: 1. Sufficiency of the complaint 2. Sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and the effect of the\nrecantation.\n\nThe Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe appeal is\nbereft of merit. The affidavit of\ndesistance cannot be the basis for granting a new trial or an acquittal.\n\nFirst Issue: Sufficiency\nof the Complaint\n\nThe defense\npoints out that when the complaint was lodged with the police by Complainant\nJoylyn Garcia, the latter âwas not in full control of her mental faculties as\nshe was still then in a state of shock.â [18] Because of Joylynâs condition at\nthe time, the complaint should have been filed by her parents. Since it was the complainantâs aunt and\nelder sister who âassistedâ her in filing the complaint, appellant posits that\nthe regional trial court acquired no jurisdiction over the case. [19]\n\nWe are not\npersuaded. Complainant Joylyn Garcia\nmay have been mentally distressed, but she was not proven to be legally\nincapacitated. In the presence of PO3\nFidel Geronimo, she was able to personally sign her Salaysay or\naffidavit showing her ravishment. In\nsaid Salaysay , she answered the police officerâs questions on why she\nwas there, stating that she was raped by her own father. [20] It was only thereafter that she was\nassisted by Rowena Garcia, her sister, in narrating how the rape was committed. [21] At any rate, a person is presumed to be in control of his\nor her faculties. Whoever alleges\notherwise has the burden of proof. Aside from his bare allegations, appellant presented no convincing\nevidence that complainant was legally incapacitated by reason of her mental\nstate when she filed her complaint. Accordingly, it becomes immaterial that only her aunt and elder sister,\nwho were not her guardians, assisted her. Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, clearly provides that she\ncould have filed the complaint on her own, viz. : âxxx The offended party,\neven if she were a minor, has the right to initiate the prosecution for the\nabove offenses, independently of her parents, grandparents or guardians, unless\nshe is incompetent or incapable of doing so upon grounds other than her\nminority. xxxâ\n\nSecond Issue: Sufficiency\nof Prosecution Evidence\n\nAfter a thorough\nreview of the evidence presented during the trial, we hold that the\ntrial court did not err in convicting appellant. Joylyn Garcia testified that she was twice raped by her own\nfather, as shown by salient portions of her February 9, 1993 testimony: âPUBLIC PROS.: Sometime in the middle of October,\n1992, do you remember of any unusual incident that happened to you? A.: Yes,\nsir Q.: What\nwas that? A.: I\nwas then sick at that time lying on a bed, then my father gave me medicine\nwhich have [sic] caused me to sleep and he then placed himself on top of me. Q.: Would\nyou still remember the exact date when that sad experience of yours happened? A.: I\ncannot remember the date, sir. Q.: Was\nit in the first week of October? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: Or\nit could also be in the 2nd week of October? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: After\nyour father placed himself on top of you, what did he do, if you still\nremember? A.: He\nraped me, sir. Q.: Will\nyou described [sic] how you were raped by your father? A.: He\npointed or poked a pointed object on my right side, then, âginalaw niya akoâ. Q.: Will\nyou describe to the Honorable Court how you were abused by your father? A.: He\nwas holding my 2 arms and spreading my 2 knees. Then he inserted his private organ to my private organ. Q.: You\nsaid your father raped you. If your\nfather is in Court, will you be able to point to him? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: Please\ndo. INTERPRETER: Witness pointing to a person\npresently in Court seated at the front row and when asked to give his name, he\nidentified himself as Eduardo Garcia. PUBLIC PROS.: You said that your father placed\nhimself on top of you and inserted his private organ to your private organ, is\nthat correct? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: After\nthat, what more did he do, if any? A.: [H]e\nrepeated it, sir. Q.: What\ndo you mean by âhe repeated itâ? A.: He\nrepeated what he had done to me. Q.: How\nlong if you remember did he stay on top of you when his penis was inserted\ninside your organ? A.: About\n3 minutes, sir. Q.: After\n3 minutes, what did your father do? A.: He\njust left, sir. Q.: Do\nyou mean he went out of your house? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: How\nabout you, what did you do after your father left and raped you? A.: I\nwent to my auntie and told her what happened. Q.: What\n[sic] happened in the middle part of October, 1992, is that right? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: You\nsaid you went to your auntie, by the way, what time did your father had [sic]\nsexual intercourse with you in the middle part of October, 1992? A.: It\nwas at 9:00 oâclock in the evening. Q.: After\nthe incident in the middle part of October, 1992, did your father do anything\nto you? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: What\nwas that he did to you? A.: He\nagain inserted his private organ to my organ. Q.: In\nyour reckoning, when did your father do this again to you? A.: I\ncannot remember, sir. Q.: You\nsaid that the first time you were raped by your father was in the middle part\nof October. After October, 1992, did\nyour father again rape you or have sexual intercourse with you? A.: After\none month, sir. Q.: Would\nthat mean the following month, which is November? A.: Yes,\nsir. Q.: Where\ndid your father have sexual intercourse with you for the second time? A.: In\nour house, sir. Q.: Do\nyou still remember what time of the day it happened? A.: In the evening, sir.â [22]\n\nThe foregoing\ntestimony, by itself, is sufficient to overcome the presumption of\ninnocence. Indeed, âwhen an alleged\nvictim of rape says that she was violated, she says in effect all that is\nnecessary to show that the rape has been inflicted on her and so long as her\ntestimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the\nbasis thereof.â [23] Moreover, the trial court itself gave full credence to the said\ntestimony. Well-settled is the rule\nthat the trial courtâs assessment of the credibility of witnesses is conclusive\nand binding on appellate courts. [24] We find no reason to disregard the\ntrial courtâs evaluation of young Joylynâs testimony.\n\nWe are not\npersuaded by appellantâs insistent denial, which is a weak defense that is easy\nto fabricate. It failed to overcome\nJoylynâs testimony during trial which identified him as the perpetrator of two\ncounts of rape.\n\nAppellant also\ncites other circumstances which allegedly negate the commission of rape: 1. â[I]t\nis contrary to human experience that a mother will be so callous and uncaring as\nto allow the second rape to be committed on her daughter.â 2. A\nfamily feud existed between the accused and Librada Nuqui by reason of their\nquarrel over a market stall. 3. The\nfamily abode is located in a crowded squatter area and it is thus âimprobable\nthat the crime charged could have been committed without being noticed by the\nneighbors.â 4. Joylynâs\ntestimony is inconsistent and incredible because in her Salaysay âshe\nomitted to mention that she was given medicine by her fatherâ and, when queried\nduring cross-examination on this omission, she could not give an adequate\nexplanation, stating instead that her father threatened her with a pointed\nobject. 5. Although\nappellantâs wife testified that she and her husband usually left and returned\nhome together, Joylyn did not explain why she was home alone with appellant\nduring the alleged rape. 6. From\nJune to November 11, 1992, complainant stayed in the house of Librada Nuqui,\nbut she was already tulala when she returned home. 7. âThe alleged rape is not supported by the\nphysical evidence on record,â because of Dr. Pobleteâs finding of an intact\nhymen and testimony that there was no penetration â(e)ven if there has been\nactual contact.â [25]\n\nThe foregoing\nappear to have been raised faute de\nmieux and do not detract from the correctness of the trial courtâs factual\nfinding and conclusion.\n\nThe allegation\nthat the mother could not have allowed her daughter to be raped a second time\nhas no factual basis. The record\nreveals no indication that the mother had any knowledge of either the first or\nthe second rape. It appears that Joylyn\nnever reported the first incident of rape to her mother. Significantly, Joylyn intimated the atrocity\nto her aunt (Librada Nuqui) and not to her mother. [26]\n\nMoreover, it is\nimplausible that, for a mere squabble over a market stall, [27] Librada Nuqui would allow Joylyn to\nsuffer the untold difficulties and humiliation attendant on a rape prosecution\nif the accusation were not true. It\nmust be noted that Librada took Joylyn Garcia home and cared for her; in\nreturn, Joylyn showered her with a love greater than that which she gave to her\nparents. [28]\n\nNeither does the\ncrime scene render the commission of the crime impossible. This Court has held that rape âcan be\ncommitted even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside,\nwithin school premises and even inside a house where there are other occupants\nor where other members of the family are also sleeping. Lust is no respecter of time and place.â [29]\n\nAppellant raises\ntoo much ado over the failure of Joylyn to mention in her Salaysay that\nher father gave her some medicine before he raped her, a detail found however\nin her testimony. This omission merely\nshows that her sworn statement was incomplete, but it does not detract from the\noverall veracity of her testimony. [30] The lapse in her sworn statement\nwas consistent with her mental stress at the time of its execution.\n\nWe also find\npointless appellantâs insistence that, in view of the testimony of his wife\nthat she and her husband usually left and returned home together, the victim\nshould have explained why she was alone with him during the alleged rape. Such explanation is immaterial. The prosecutionâs duty is to prove that the\naccused committed the crime, not to explain a circumstance of insignificant\nrelevance. As earlier observed, the\nprosecution successfully discharged this burden.\n\nEqually\npointless is appellantâs allegation that the victim stayed in the house of\nLibrada Nuqui from June to November 11, 1992 and was already tulala when\nshe returned. Appellant, however, is\nnot here arguing that the victim never set foot inside the locus criminis during the period in question. On the\nother hand, Joylyn did testify that, in two instances, her father raped her\ninside their house.\n\nLikewise, we\ncannot sustain appellantâs argument that the physical evidence did not support\nthe alleged rape. The medical expert\nfor the prosecution testified that there were hymenal lacerations. Although this was rebutted by Dr. Poblete\nwho appeared for the defense, it must be emphasized that hymenal laceration is\nnot an element of rape. It is\nsufficient that there was sexual congress, and that this was consummated by the\nslightest introduction of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum. [31]\n\nOn the basis of\nthe evidence presented during trial, the trial court was justified in\nconcluding that appellant committed the crime charged. After the promulgation of the assailed\nDecision, however, herein appellant presented a ânewly discovered evidenceâ and\nprayed that a new trial be conducted. In view of the pendency of this appeal, the trial court held that the\nmatter should be addressed to this Court. We shall now resolve it.\n\nRecantation and Motion for New Trial\n\nOn February 27,\n1995, during the pendency of this appeal to this Court, the defense filed\nbefore the trial court a timely Motion for New Trial on the basis of an\nAffidavit of Desistance executed by Complainant Joylyn Garcia on November 25,\n1994. Such motion was filed under Sec. 2, Rule 121 of the Rules of Court,\nwhich provides: âSec. 2. Grounds for a new trial . -- The court\nshall grant a new trial on any of the following grounds:\n\n(a) That\nerrors of law or irregularities have been committed during the trial\nprejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused;\n\n(b) That\nnew and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not with\nreasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial, and which if\nintroduced and admitted, would probably change the judgment.â\n\nWhen confronted\nwith an affidavit of recantation, courts are called upon to weigh\ncountervailing values in our legal and judicial system. A recantation, as a general rule, is not\nsufficient to warrant a new trial. If\nit were otherwise, a new trial would be granted whenever an interested party\nsucceeds in intimidating or inducing any or some of the witnesses to retract\nafter trial their testimony, thus, opening the door to endless litigation. It is also injudicious to reject a testimony\nsolely on the basis of such recantation, which may later be repudiated, as this\nâwill make a solemn trial a mockery and place the investigation at the mercy of\nunscrupulous witnesses.â [32] Thus, the Court in People vs.\nJunio [33] held: âThe appellantâs submission\nthat the execution of an Affidavit of Desistance by complainant who was\nassisted by her mother supported the âinherent incredibility of prosecutionâs\nevidenceâ is specious. We have said in\nso many cases that retractions are generally unreliable and are looked upon\nwith considerable disfavor by the courts. The unreliable character of this document is shown by the fact that it\nis quite incredible that after going through the process of having\naccused-appellant arrested by the police, positively identifying him as the\nperson who raped her, enduring the humiliation of a physical examination of her\nprivate parts, and then repeating her accusation in open court by recounting\nher anguish, Maryjane would suddenly turn around and declare that â[a]fter a\ncareful deliberation over the case, (she) find(s) that the same does not merit\nor warrant criminal prosecution.â Thus, we have declared that\nat most the retraction is an afterthought which should not be given probative\nvalue. It would be a dangerous rule to\nreject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the\nwitness who has given it later on changed his mind for one reason or\nanother. Such a rule will make a solemn\ntrial a mockery and place the investigation at the mercy of unscrupulous\nwitnesses. Because affidavits of\nretraction can easily be secured from poor and ignorant witnesses, usually for\nmonetary consideration, the Court has invariably regarded such affidavits as\nexceedingly unreliable.â\n\nTo warrant a new\ntrial, Joylynâs affidavit of desistance must constitute a recantation and not a\nmere withdrawal from the prosecution of the case. The Court en banc in Alonte, [34] speaking through Mr. Justice Jose\nC. Vitug, held that the complainantâs affidavit of desistance did not\nconstitute a recantation, because she did not deny the truth of her complaint\nbut merely sought to âbe allowed to withdrawâ and âdiscontinueâ the case because she wished âto start life anew and live normally\nagain.â She never absolved or\nexculpated the accused. In other words,\na recantation of a prior statement or testimony must necessarily renounce the\nsaid statement or testimony and withdraw it formally and publicly. [35]\n\nAlthough the\naffidavit of Joylyn states that â[i]t is not true that my father, Eduardo Garcia,\nraped me at our house,â it is bereft of details or any other badge of\ncredibility, not to say of truth. Such\na statement is not sufficient; it is merely a legal conclusion that could not\nhave come directly from the mouth of this young girl. More likely, it was prepared by a legal mind and presented to the\ncomplainant already typed and signature-ready. In comparison with the unpretentious, candid, detailed and credible\ntestimony of Joylyn quoted earlier in this Decision, the affidavit crumbles into\na desperate clutch at straws. It is not\nthe withdrawal or recantation or exculpation that the law considers sufficient\nto overturn the overwhelming evidence earlier given during the trial.\n\nExperience has\ntaught us that it is not difficult to get the signatures of poor, unlettered\nand gullible witnesses in strangely worded and difficult to decipher legalese\ncontained in affidavits of desistance. In the words of Mme. Justice Ameurfina A. Melencio-Herrera: âx x x\naffidavits of recantation can easily be secured from poor and ignorant\nwitnesses for monetary consideration or through intimidation. Recanted testimony is exceedingly\nunreliable, for there is always the probability that it may later be\nrepudiated. Courts thus look with\ndisfavor at affidavits of retractions of testimony given in open court, and are\nwary or reluctant to allow a new trial based on retracted testimony. Indeed, it would be a dangerous rule to\nreject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the\nwitness later on changed his mind for one reason or another, for such a rule\nwill make a solemn trial a mockery and will place the investigation of truth at\nthe mercy of unscrupulous witnesses. [36]\n\nIn the case at\nbar, Joylyn executed her affidavit of desistance (1) about one year and nine\nmonths after she voluntarily and solemnly gave her testimony before the trial\ncourt, and (2) more than ten months after the judgment of conviction was\npromulgated. This Court is inclined to\ngive credence and faith to this girlâs straightforward, detailed and consistent\ntestimony rather than to the brief, perfunctory, pro forma and highly\nsuspect affidavit of desistance which obviously did not emanate directly from\nher mouth but was merely prepared for her adherence. âIt is absurd to disregard a testimony that has undergone trial\nand scrutiny by the court and the parties simply because an affidavit\nwithdrawing the testimony is subsequently presented by the defense.â [37] It is simply inconceivable that\nJoylyn, a naive thirteen-year-old girl would falsely accuse her own father of\nrape and wreak havoc on their family unless her solitary goal is to âbring to\njustice the satyr whose beastliness [is] the cause of her loss of virginity at\na tender age.â [38] Unarguably, her affidavit of\ndesistance -- executed after the completion of the trial and the promulgation\nof the judgment of conviction -- has no probative value [39] and cannot be the basis for granting a new trial or an\nacquittal.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal is DENIED and\nthe assailed Decision finding Eduardo Garcia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of\ntwo counts of rape, sentencing him to two terms of reclusion perpetua and ordering him to pay indemnity of P 100,000 is AFFIRMED .
