Dismissal; when proper. - The Tribunal may require the protestant or counter-protestant to indicate, within a fixed period, the province or provinces numbering not more than three, best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities alleged in his petition; and the revision of ballots and reception of evidence will begin with such provinces. If upon examination of such ballots and proof, and after making reasonable allowances, the Tribunal is convinced that, taking all circumstances into account, the protestant or counter-protestant will most probably fail to make out his case, the protest may forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in the protest.

LEGARDA, Protestant, vs. NOLI L. DE CASTRO, Protestee.R E S O L U T I O N\nLOREN B. LEGARDA, Protestant, vs. NOLI L. DE CASTRO, Protestee.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nOn June 23, 2004, Congress sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBC) proclaimed [1] protestee Noli L. de Castro the duly elected Vice-President of the\nRepublic of the Philippines. The official count of the votes cast for\nVice-President in the May 10, 2004 elections showed that the protestee\nobtained the highest number of votes, garnering 15,100,431 votes as\nagainst the 14,218,709 votes garnered by the protestant Loren B.\nLegarda, who placed second, in a field consisting of four candidates\nfor Vice-President.\n\nOn July 23, 2004, the protestant filed this protest with this Tribunal\npraying for the annulment of the protestee’s proclamation as the duly\nelected Vice-President of the Republic of the Philippines. [2]\n\nThe protest has two main parts. The First Aspect originally covered “all the erroneous, if not manipulated, and\nfalsified results as reflected in the final canvass documents” for\n9,007 precincts in six provinces, one city and five municipalities. [3] Protestant avers that the correct results appearing in the election\nreturns were not properly transferred and reflected in the subsequent\nelection documents and ultimately, in the final canvass of documents\nused as basis for protestee’s proclamation. Protestant seeks the\nrecomputation, recanvass and retabulation of the election returns to\ndetermine the true result.\n\nThe Second Aspect required revision of ballots in 124,404 precincts specified in the protest. [4]\n\nThe Tribunal confirmed its jurisdiction over the protest and denied the\nmotion of protestee for its outright dismissal. Protestee filed a\nmotion for reconsideration arguing in the main that the Tribunal erred\nin ruling that the protest alleged a cause of action sufficient to\ncontest protestee’s victory in the May 2004 elections. [5]\n\nOn March 31, 2005, the Tribunal ruled that: On the matter of sufficiency of the protest, protestee\nfailed to adduce new substantial arguments to reverse our ruling. We\nhold that while Peña v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal on requisites of sufficiency of election protest is still good law, it\nis inapplicable in this case. We dismissed the petition in Peña because it failed to specify the contested precincts. In the instant protest, protestant enumerated all the provinces, municipalities and cities where she questions all the results in all the precincts therein. The protest here is sufficient in form and substantively, serious\nenough on its face to pose a challenge to protestee’s title to his\noffice. In our view, the instant protest consists of alleged ultimate\nfacts, not mere conclusions of law, that need to be proven in due time.\n\nConsidering that we find the protest sufficient in form and substance, we must again stress that nothing as yet has been proved as to the veracity of the allegations. The protest is only sufficient for the Tribunal to proceed and give the\nprotestant the opportunity to prove her case pursuant to Rule 61 of the\nPET Rules. Although said rule only pertains to revision of ballots,\nnothing herein prevents the Tribunal from allowing or including the\ncorrection of manifest errors, pursuant to the Tribunal’s rule-making\npower under Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution.\n\nOn a related matter, the protestant in her reiterating motion prays for ocular inspection and inventory-taking of ballot boxes, and\nappointment of watchers. However, the Tribunal has already ordered the\nprotection and safeguarding of the subject ballot boxes; and it has\nissued also the appropriate directives to officials concerned. At this\npoint, we find no showing of an imperative need for the relief prayed\nfor, since protective and safeguard measures are already being\nundertaken by the custodians of the subject ballot boxes.\n\nWHEREFORE , protestee’s motion for reconsideration is hereby DENIED WITH FINALITY for lack of merit. Protestant’s reiterating motion for ocular\ninspection and inventory-taking with very urgent prayer for the\nappointment of watchers is also DENIED for lack of showing as to its actual necessity.\n\nFurther, the protestant LOREN B. LEGARDA is ORDERED to specify, within ten (10) days from notice, the three (3) provinces\nbest exemplifying the manifest errors alleged in the first part of her\nprotest, and three (3) provinces best exemplifying the frauds and\nirregularities alleged in the second part of her protest, for the\npurpose herein elucidated.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal hereby ORDERS the Commission on Elections to SUBMIT, within 30 days hereof, the official project of precincts of the May 2004 Elections.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6] On April 11, 2005, protestant identified three (3) provinces as pilot areas best exemplifying her grounds for the First Aspect of the protest. She chose the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Lanao del\nNorte, and Surigao del Sur with the following number of protested\nprecincts: 1,607, 2,346 and 350, respectively, or a total of 4,303 out\nof the original 9,007 precincts. [7]\n\nOn June 21, 2005, the Tribunal ascertained [8] the number of ballot boxes subject of the protest, to wit: The Tribunal Resolved to NOTE the Letter dated 30 May 2005\nfiled by Executive Director Pio Jose S. Joson, COMELEC, in compliance\nwith the Letter dated 14 April 2005 of Atty. Luzviminda D. Puno, Acting\nClerk of the Tribunal, informing the Tribunal that one thousand four\nhundred fifty-four (1,454) ballot boxes are involved in the precincts\nof the province of Surigao del Sur which the protestant has identified\nto the Tribunal as best exemplifying the irregularities in connection\nwith the 10 May 2004 National and Local Elections.\n\nAccordingly, without prejudice to its recomputation, the number of\nballot boxes involved in the precincts of the provinces which the\nprotestant has identified to the Tribunal as best exemplifying the\nirregularities in connection with the said elections are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nLanao del Sur | | 1,568\nLanao del Norte | | 2,317\nSurigao del Sur | | 1,454\nCebu City | | 10,127\nPampanga | | 5,458\nMaguindanao | | 1,755\nTotal | | 22,679 ballot boxesinvolved in the precincts\n | x P500.00\nP11,339,500.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nLanao del Sur 1,568 Lanao del Norte 2,317 Surigao del Sur 1,454 Cebu City 10,127 Pampanga 5,458 Maguindanao 1,755 Total 22,679 ballot boxes\ninvolved in the precincts x P500.00 P11,339,500.00\nOn November 2, 2005 protestant moved to withdraw and abandon almost all pilot precincts in the First Aspect except those in the province of Lanao del Sur. [9] On November 22, 2005, the Tribunal granted the said motion withdrawing\nand abandoning the protest involving the manifest errors in the\nmunicipalities of Lanao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. [10]\n\nThereafter, proceedings duly ensued concerning both the First and Second Aspects. Former Associate Justice Bernardo P. Pardo as Hearing Commissioner [11] heard the presentation of evidence of both parties for the First\nAspect. Subpoenas were issued to the witnesses of the protestant, e.g.\nthe President/General Manager of Ernest Printing Corporation [12] and then Commission on Elections Chairman Benjamin Abalos. [13] On August 28, 2006, a preliminary conference was called by Hearing\nCommissioner Bernardo P. Pardo to schedule the presentation of\nevidence. The latter then ordered as follows: Pursuant to the Resolution of the Tribunal dated 22 August\n2006, setting the preliminary conference of the parties with the\nHearing Commissioner today, the designated Hearing Commissioner called\nthe preliminary conference in order to consider the order of hearing\nand presentation of evidence of the parties according to the procedure\nprescribed in the Resolution of the Tribunal of 1 August 2006, under\nparagraph B (1 and 2).\n\nThe following are the appearances\n1) Protestant Loren B. Legarda, in person;\n\n2) Atty. Sixto S. Brillantes, Jr. and Atty. Jesus P. Casila, for the protestant;\n\n3) Protestee Noli L. de Castro did not appear;\n\n4) Atty. Armando M. Marcelo and Atty. Carlo Vistan, for the protestee. Atty. Brillantes manifested that the protestant is ready to adduce\ntestimonial and documentary evidence on a date to be scheduled and\nagreed upon by the parties; they have about seven witnesses to testify\non the first aspect as indicated in the Tribunal’s Resolution of 1\nAugust 2006. He suggested 6 September 2006 as the initial date of the\nhearing. Atty. Marcelo stated that he was leaving for abroad on 6\nSeptember 2006 for one month and suggested a hearing after his return\nin October 2006. At any rate, protestee has a pending motion for\nreconsideration of the Tribunal’s Resolution of 22 August 2006\ndesignating a retired Justice of the Supreme Court as Hearing\nCommissioner. They wanted an incumbent Justice of the Supreme Court or\nan official of the Tribunal who is a member of the Bar to be the\ndesignated Hearing Commissioner.\n\nThe undersigned Hearing Commissioner suggested that the initial hearing\nbe held on 4 September 2006, at 10:00 a.m., when protestee’s counsel\nwill still be in town, without prejudice to the resolution of the\nTribunal on his motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe undersigned Hearing Commissioner suggested to protestant’s counsel\nto submit by this afternoon the list of the names of the proposed\nwitnesses and documents to be produced so that the proper process may\nbe issued to them.\n\nThe undersigned Hearing Commissioner set the initial hearing\ntentatively on Monday, 4 September 2006, at 10:00 a.m., at the same\nvenue, subject to the Tribunal’s ruling on protestee’s motion for\nreconsideration of the person of the Hearing Commissioner, and\nprotestant to submit by this afternoon the list of witnesses and\ndocuments to be produced at the hearing.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [14] Several hearings on the First Aspect were held wherein the protestant adduced evidence and the protestee\ninterposed his continuing objection to such in the form of motions and\ncomments. Months of continuous trial took place until the Hearing\nCommissioner made his final report of the proceedings for detailed\nconsideration by the Tribunal.\n\nOn January 31, 2006, while the case was sub judice, the Tribunal ordered both parties to refrain from sensationalizing the\ncase in the media. Its extended resolution on the matter reads as\nfollows: On December 12, 2005, the re-tabulation of election\nreturns (ERs) from the ten (10) protested municipalities of Lanao del\nSur commenced. According to the report submitted by the Acting Clerk of\nthe Tribunal, Atty. Maria Luisa D. Villarama, the correction team was\nable to re-tabulate only the ERs from four (4) of the ten (10)\nprotested municipalities of Lanao del Sur, namely, Balindong, Masiu,\nMulondo and Taraka. The ERs of the other six (6) protested\nmunicipalities were not found inside the ballot boxes collected from\nthe House of Representatives, but found were the ERs from\nmunicipalities not subject of the protest.\n\nTherefore, acting on the aforementioned report of the Acting Clerk, the Tribunal resolves to REQUIRE Hon.\nRoberto Nazareno, Secretary General of the House of Representatives and\nAtty. Artemio Adasa, Jr., Deputy Secretary General for Operation, of\nthe House of Representatives, within a non-extendible period of five\n(5) days from notice, to (a) DELIVER to the Tribunal the election returns\nand other election documents/paraphernalia used in the May 2004\nNational/Local elections for the remaining six (6) protested\nmunicipalities of Lanao del Sur, namely (1) Bacolod-Kalawi; (2)\nGanassi; (3) Kapai; (4) Sultan Gumander; (5) Tamparan; and (6) Wao;\n\n(b) EXPLAIN why the election returns and other election documents and paraphernalia\nwhich were turned over to the PET Retrieval Team are incomplete when\ncompared to the COMELEC’s total number of clustered precincts for Lanao\ndel Sur; and\n\n(c) SUBMIT to the Tribunal the complete\nlist of all the election returns, Provincial/District Certificates of\nCanvass and Statements of Votes and other election documents and\nparaphernalia used in the May 2004 National and Local Elections for the\nprovince of Lanao del Sur which were in its official custody. In the resolution dated December 6, 2005, the Tribunal granted\nprotestant’s motion to suspend the remittance of additional cash\ndeposit amounting to P3,882,000 as required in the resolution of\nNovember 22, 2005. Protestant also manifested in said motion that she\nwill make the required cash deposit sometime in the year 2006. Thus,\nthe Tribunal resolves to REQUIRE protestant to comply with the resolution of November 22, 2005 requiring\nher to make additional cash deposit of P3,882,000 within ten (10) days.\n\nOn another matter, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal notes the following news reports: (1) In an article entitled “Recount shows fraud, says\nLegarda” appearing in the December 13, 2005 issue of The Manila Times,\nprotestant Legarda said that the election returns from Congress had\nbeen tampered after initial retabulation of votes by the Tribunal\nshowed that the lead of protestee De Castro over her has widened. She\nadded that this discovery confirmed her claim of massive poll fraud in\nfavor of protestee in the 2004 election.\n\n(2) In an article entitled “Intel feelers offer proof of poll fraud to\nLoren” published in the December 13, 2005 issue of The Daily Tribune,\nsources from protestant’s legal team said that feelers from the\nmilitary’s intelligence service arm have reached their camp offering\nvideotapes of cheating in the 2004 elections for a price they cannot\nafford.\n\n(3) In another article entitled “Election returns altered inside\nCongress—Loren” published in the December 15, 2005 issue of Philippine\nDaily Inquirer, protestant claimed that the altering of election\nreturns from Lanao del Sur occurred right inside Congress as borne out\nby the “spurious” returns being retabulated by the Tribunal. She said\nthe crime could have been perpetrated by the operatives of protestee.\n\n(4) In a news article entitled “Cebu recount shows Noli, Loren votes\ntally with NBC” appearing in the January 6, 2006 issue of The Manila\nTimes, Atty. Romulo Macalintal, counsel of protestee, stated that “the\ninitial recount in Lapu-lapu showed that there was no tampering of the\nballot boxes in the city,” and further noted that the four (4) out of\nthe 40 ballot boxes “contained tampered or spurious ballots, but these\nare not connected to the protest of Senator Legarda but on local\nprotests.”\n\n(5) In an article entitled “Noli condemns tampering of ballots”\nappearing in the January 6, 2006 issue of Manila Standard Today, Atty.\nArmando Marcelo said that their revisors at the PET discovered that\nseveral ballots of Legarda had been substituted with fake and spurious\nballots. Atty. Macalintal added that “the substitution of ballots was\nso clear, that the security markings of the substitute ballots were not\nreflected or visible or that the ultraviolet markings of the COMELEC\nseal do not appear or are not present”, and that “these ultraviolet\nmarkings are readily visible in a genuine ballot once lighted with an\nultraviolet light.”\n\n(6) In an article entitled “No cheating in Cebu, Noli's lawyer\ninsists,” published in the January 19, 2006 issue of Philippine Daily\nInquirer, Atty. Macalintal said that “the results of the actual count\nof the ballots for Legarda and De Castro from the cities of Mandaue and\nLapu-lapu tallied with the results as reflected in the election returns\nand tally boards. There was no sign of any tampering of the results of\nthe ballot count as well as the votes reflected on the returns and\ntally boards.” He also said that protestant Legarda is already estopped\nfrom questioning the results of the election in these cities since she\nfailed to object to the returns.\n\n(7) In an article entitled “GMA-Noli poll win in Cebu affirmed,”\npublished in the January 19, 2006 issue of The Philippine Star, it was\nreported that Atty. Macalintal, in his speech before the Rotary Club of\nPasay City, denied protestant’s claim that 90 percent of the ballots\nfrom two major cities of the province were found to be spurious by the\nTribunal. He added that “if a candidate would allow himself to be\ncheated by 90 percent, then he or she has no business to be in\npolitics.”\n\n(8) In an article entitled “Why Noli is unacceptable” appearing in the\nJanuary 20, 2006 issue of The Daily Tribune, protestant “told the media\nthat the real ballots from Mandaue City and Lapu-lapu City were\n‘clearly substituted with fakes so that they would correspond with the\nsimilarly spurious results reflected in the election returns (ERs).’” Surely, the parties do not harbor the idea that the re-tabulation of\nelection returns and revision of ballots is the end of the election\nprotest. They are merely the first phase of the process and must still\npass closer scrutiny by the Tribunal.\n\nThe great public interest at stake behooves the Tribunal to exercise\nits power and render judgment free from public pressure and\nuninterrupted by the parties’ penchant for media mileage. Therefore, in\nview of the foregoing reports where press statements of both parties\nappeared as an attempt to influence the proceedings, convince the\npublic of their version of facts, and create bias, prejudice and\nsympathies, the Tribunal resolves to WARN both parties and counsels from making public comments on all matters that are sub judice.\n\nFinally, acting on the pleadings filed in this electoral protest case, the Tribunal further Resolves to (a) NOTE the Comment on Protestee’s Motion to Allow Revisors to Examine All Ballots dated January 24, 2006, filed by counsel for protestant Legarda, in\ncompliance with the resolution of January 17, 2006, informing the\nTribunal that she interposes no objection and opposition to the motion\nand GRANT the aforesaid motion of the protestee;\n\n(b) DIRECT all Head Revisors to ALLOW the parties to examine the ballots within a reasonable time;\n\n(c) NOTE the Manifestation dated January 24, 2006, filed by counsel for protestant relative to the\nMotion to Intervene filed by Intervenor/Movant Amytis D. Batao,\ninforming the Tribunal that she is not waiving the revision of the\nthirty-five (35) ballot boxes subject of the electoral protest for the\nmayoralty post of Carmen, Cebu, and proposing that priority be given\nand extended to the same so that upon completion of the revision by the\nTribunal, said ballot boxes can be returned to the Regional Trial Court\nof Mandaue City, at the earliest time possible; and\n\n(d) DENY the above Motion to Intervene of Intervenor/Movant Amytis D. Batao, with regard to the return of the\nballot boxes considering that the Tribunal has priority in their\npossession and examination.” Ynares Santiago, J., no part. [15] Revision of ballots was also conducted for the Second Aspect in the Tribunal’s premises by the duly designated officials and trained\npersonnel with both parties duly represented. After ten months of\ncontinuous work by twenty-four revision teams, under the supervision of\nAtty. Orlando Cariño as the designated Consultant, the revision of the\nballots from the pilot province of Cebu was completed. Revision also\nstarted for the second pilot province of Pampanga, but was suspended\nafter the Tribunal granted the protestee’s Motion for Partial\nDetermination of Election Protest Based on the Results of the Revision\nof Ballots of the Province of Cebu and the Recanvass of Election\nReturns from Lanao Del Sur and to Hold in Abeyance Revision of Ballots\nfrom Pampanga. [16]\n\nOn May 3, 2007, the protestant was required to deposit P3,914,500 for\nexpenses necessary for the continuation of the revision of ballots. [17] But protestant failed to pay on the due date. Thus, protestee moved to\ndismiss the protest. The Tribunal extended the period for protestant to\nmake the necessary deposit. Even with this extension, she still failed\nto pay. Thus, in a Resolution dated June 5, 2007, the Tribunal\npartially granted the protestee’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 33 [18] of PET rules, and ordered the dismissal of the Second Aspect of the protest as follows: PET Case No. 003 (Loren B. Legarda vs. Noli L. de Castro).\n– Acting on the protestee’s Motion to Dismiss dated May 9, 2007, the\nTribunal Resolved to (a) PARTIALLY GRANT the aforesaid motion pursuant to Rule 33 of the 2005 PET Rules; and\n\n(b) DISMISS the second aspect of the protest (revision of ballots), for protestant’s failure to make the required deposit. The Tribunal further Resolved to DENY the request of Atty. Eric C. Reginaldo in his letter dated May 29, 2007\nthat he be furnished with a copy of the petition in this case for case\nstudy, as he is neither a party nor a counsel of any party in this\nprotest. [19] On June 13, 2007, Hearing Commissioner Bernardo P. Pardo submitted to the Tribunal a Report of the Proceedings of the First Aspect. [20]\n\nOn June 18 2007, protestant filed an Urgent Motion to Resolve First Aspect of the Protest, stating that she formally moved for the immediate\nresolution of the submitted portion of the First Aspect of the protest. [21] Protestee did not interpose any objection to this motion.\n\nOn July 10, 2007, the Tribunal resolved to note the report of the\nHearing Commissioner. In response to the motion filed by the\nprotestant, the Tribunal required the parties to submit their\nrespective memoranda within twenty days from notice, pursuant to Rule 61 [22] of the PET Rules. [23]\n\nOn August 2, 2007, by counsel protestant submitted her memorandum. [24] On August 16, 2007, also by counsel protestee filed his memorandum. [25]\n\nOn October 1, 2007, Hearing Commissioner Bernardo P. Pardo submitted his Final Report of the Proceedings on the First Aspect. After a thorough analysis of the parties’ memoranda and the results of\nthe proceedings on the protest, he recommended the dismissal of the First Aspect. [26]\n\nFor her part, protestant filed a memorandum stating that based on the\npieces of evidence she presented, both documentary and testimonial, she\nhas shown that electoral fraud or cheating was committed through the\nso-called dagdag-bawas strategy\nin the elections for President and Vice-President held last May 14,\n2004. Protestant in particular submitted that electoral fraud was\nperpetuated as follows: That the correct votes of the parties\nwere properly recorded and tabulated in the election returns (ERs),\nwherein she garnered a higher number of votes over protestee De Castro; [27] That when the ERs were canvassed at the municipal level, the\nER results were “wrongly and erroneously” transposed and transferred to\nthe Statement of Votes by Precinct (SOV-P), such that the protestee was\ngiven a higher number of votes; [28] That the inaccurate results shown in the SOV-P were totaled\nand transferred to the Municipal Certificate of Canvass (MCOC), with\nprotestee prevailing over protestant; [29] That the MCOC, with incorrect totals, was transmitted to the\nProvincial Board of Canvassers, wherein the inaccurate MCOC totals were\ntransposed to the Statement of Votes by Municipalities (SOV-M); [30] That the numbers reflected in the individual SOV-Ms were\ntotaled, and the sum for the whole province was indicated in the\nProvincial Certificate of Canvass (PCOC); [31] That the PCOCs, with the erroneously transposed totals\nstemming from the incorrect SOV-Ps, were the ones canvassed by\nCongress, acting as the National Board of Canvassers for the\npresidential and vice-presidential positions; [32] and That Congress, sitting as the National Board of Canvassers,\nmerely “noted” and denied protestant’s request to view the\nprecinct-source ERs, and proceeded to canvass the\n“already-manipulated/dagdag-bawas” PCOCs, resulting in the flawed and\nfarcical victory of protestee De Castro. [33] Protestant avers that fraud, by means of the anomalous election\npractices, was sufficiently proven by using her sample-pilot precincts\nin two municipalities in Lanao del Sur, particularly Balindong and\nTaraka. She likewise alleges that the “dagdag-bawas” scheme, which was perpetrated through the deliberate and erroneous\ntransposition of results from the authentic ERs to the SOV-Ps, was\nfurther aggravated by an alleged cover-up operation to hide the same.\nAccording to protestant, the Congress-retrieved copies of the ERs which\ntally with the SOV-Ps, were fake and spurious; they were intended to\ncover-up the electoral fraud committed. Protestant submits that the\ncorrect voting results are those reflected in the COMELEC and NAMFREL’s\ncopies of the ERs, not those in the copies retrieved from Congress.\n\nProtestant further claims that while she presented pieces of evidence,\nboth testimonial and documentary, in only two municipalities of Lanao\ndel Sur, i.e., Balindong and Taraka, to prove the electoral fraud\nperpetrated through the dagdag-bawas strategy, she could have shown\nthat such fraudulent machination was replicated in several other\nmunicipalities of Lanao del Sur and other provinces, such as Basilan,\nSulu, Tawi-Tawi, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, and Lanao del Sur if she\nhad enough time.\n\nProtestee, for his part, argues that the Congress-retrieved ERs are public documents as defined under Section 19 (a), [34] Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, and thus, they enjoy the presumption of regularity accorded thereto, and they are prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. He avers that there is prima facie presumption that the Congress-retrieved copies of the ERs are genuine,\nauthentic and duly executed. Protestee submits that protestant has\nfailed to rebut such presumption with clear and convincing evidence.\n\nProtestee adds that a blank or unused ER form duly authenticated by the\nCOMELEC, with the correct and complete set of security features and\nmarkings, should have been marked and offered as evidence, to serve as\nbasis for comparison with the various sets of ERs presented to prove\nthe genuiness of the security features and markings in the ER forms. On\nthis score, according to protestee, the protestant’s counsel has failed\nin his task. At any rate, protestee points out that the witnesses\npresented by protestant, i.e., COMELEC Chairman Benjamin S. Abalos and Mr. Robert Payongayong of the\nErnest Printing Corporation, testified that they were able to discern\nsecurity features and markings in the Congress-retrieved copies of the\nERs. Protestee also claims that when Mr. Payongayong testified about\nthe security features on the Congress’ copies, he was shown only a\nsample set thereof, and was not able to examine all Congress’ copies\nbeing contested. Protestee thus concludes that the Tribunal cannot rely\non the testimonies of the protestant’s witnesses debunking the\nauthenticity of the Congress-retrieved copies vis-à-vis the other sets of ER copies.\n\nProtestee further contends that, assuming arguendo that the results reflected in the COMELEC, NAMFREL and MBOC’s [35] copies of the ERs are re-tabulated, in lieu of the results in the Congress-retrieved copies, or even if all the\nvotes in the 497 precincts included in the pilot areas, as well as in\nthe remaining protested precincts in the First Aspect, are\ncounted in favor of protestant, said votes would be insufficient to\novercome the lead of the protestee totaling 881,722 votes. Hence, in\nview of the failure of the protestant to make out her case for the First Aspect of the protest, the same and ultimately the protest in its entirety,\nmust be dismissed without consideration of the other provinces\nmentioned.\n\nThe Hearing Commissioner further recommended, following the precedent set in Defensor-Santiago v. Ramos, [36] that the protest be dismissed for being moot and academic due to\nabandonment and withdrawal resulting from protestant’s election and\nassumption of office as senator. He also emphasized that assuming that\ndagdag-bawas had indeed occurred and that the results in the COMELEC’s\nER copies indicated in Annex “A” were to be used for re-tabulation,\nprotestant would be entitled to an additional 4,912 votes for the\nmunicipality of Taraka and 5,019 votes for Balindong, or a total of\n9,931 votes, which is not adequate to surpass protestee’s lead of\n881,722 votes over protestant.\n\nOn protestant’s charges of electoral fraud allegedly aggravated by a\ncover-up operation that switched or exchanged the Congress’ ER copies\nwith spurious ones, the Hearing Commissioner stressed that the\nCongress-retrieved ERs are public documents which enjoy the presumption\nof regularity and are prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. He concluded that the protestant\nfailed to adequately and convincingly rebut the presumption. The\nHearing Commissioner also emphasized that protestant failed to\nsubstantiate sufficiently her claim that the Congress-retrieved ERs are\nspurious and were switched with the authentic copies during an alleged\nbreak-in at the storage area of the House of Representatives as no\nevidence was presented to prove such break-in. Hence, the alleged\ndiscrepancies found in NAMFREL, MBOC and COMELEC’s copies of the ERs\nare insufficient to exclude the Congress-retrieved ER copies from the\nre-tabulation. The Hearing Commissioner also observed that in 11 out of\nthe 51 precincts in Balindong, Lanao del Sur, there are similar entries\nin the Congress-retrieved ERs and in the COMELEC’s copies of the ERs,\nwhere protestant garnered a higher number of votes over protestee,\nwhile the entries in the respective SOV-Ms are different in that the\nprotestee received more votes, belying protestant’s assertion that the\nCongress-retrieved ERs should all be disregarded since the results\ntherein differ from those in the COMELEC’s copies of ERs and that they\nhave been manipulated to favor protestee. Consequently, according to\nthe Hearing Commissioner’s report, protestant failed to make out her\ncase.\n\nThus, the Hearing Commissioner recommended that the protestant’s Motion to Resolve the First Aspect of the Protest under consideration should be denied, and consequently,\nthe protest itself, be dismissed for lack of legal and factual basis,\nas the pilot-tested revision of ballots or re-tabulation of the\ncertificates of canvass would not affect the winning margin of the\nprotestee in the final canvass of the returns, in addition to the\nground of abandonment or withdrawal by reason of her candidacy for,\nelection and assumption of office as Senator of the Philippines. [37]\n\nAfter thorough deliberation and consideration of the issues in this\ncase, this Tribunal finds the abovestated recommendations of its\nHearing Commissioner well-taken, and adopts them for its own.\n\nFurther, we are also in agreement that the protestant, in assuming the\noffice of Senator and discharging her duties as such, which fact we can\ntake judicial notice of, [38] has effectively abandoned or withdrawn her protest, or abandoned her\ndetermination to protect and pursue the public interest involved in the\nmatter of who is the real choice of the electorate. The most relevant\nprecedent on this issue is Defensor-Santiago v. Ramos, [39] a decision rendered by this Tribunal, which held that: The term of office of the Senators elected in the 8 May\n1995 election is six years, the first three of which coincides with the\nlast three years of the term of the President elected in the 11 May\n1992 synchronized elections. The latter would be Protestant Santiago’s\nterm if she would succeed in proving in the instant protest that she\nwas the true winner in the 1992 elections. In assuming the office of\nSenator then, the Protestant has effectively abandoned or withdrawn\nthis protest, or at the very least, in the language of Moraleja, abandoned her “determination to protect and pursue the public interest\ninvolved in the matter of who is the real choice of the electorate.”\nSuch abandonment or withdrawal operates to render moot the instant\nprotest. Moreover, the dismissal of this protest would serve public\ninterest as it would dissipate the aura of uncertainty as to the\nresults of the 1992 presidential election, thereby enhancing the all- [too] crucial political stability of the nation during this period of national recovery.\n\nIt must also be stressed that under the Rules of the Presidential\nElectoral Tribunal, an election protest may be summarily dismissed,\nregardless of the public policy and public interest implications\nthereof, on the following grounds: (1) The petition is insufficient in form and substance;\n\n(2) The petition is filed beyond the periods provided in Rules 14 and 15 hereof;\n\n(3) The filing fee is not paid within the periods provided for in these Rules;\n\n(4) The cash deposit, or the first P100,000.00 thereof, is not paid within 10 days after the filing of the protest; and\n\n(5) The petition or copies thereof and the annexes thereto filed with the Tribunal are not clearly legible. Other\ngrounds for a motion to dismiss, e.g., those provided in the Rules of\nCourt which apply in a suppletory character, may likewise be pleaded as\naffirmative defenses in the answer. After which, the Tribunal may, in\nits discretion, hold a preliminary hearing on such grounds. In sum, if\nan election protest may be dismissed on technical grounds, then it must\nbe, for a decidedly stronger reason, if it has become moot due to its\nabandonment by the Protestant. [40] In the case at bar, protestant’s tenure in the Senate coincides with\nthe term of the Vice-Presidency 2004-2010, that is the subject of her\nprotest. In Defensor-Santiago v. Ramos, the protestant’s tenure in the Senate also coincided with the term of\nthe Presidency she was vying for. Like the protestant in the\naforementioned case, the protestant in the case at bar filed her\ncertificate of candidacy for the Senate, campaigned for the office,\nassumed office after election, and discharged the duties and functions\nof said office. Thus, we agree concerning the applicability of the Defensor-Santiago case as a precedent in the resolution of the present protest, though they differ in that Defensor-Santiago’s case involves the Presidency while Legarda’s protest concerns only the Vice-Presidency.\n\nOn the matter of the alleged spurious ER copies, we agree with the\nprotestee that the protestant had not adequately and convincingly\nrebutted the presumption that as public documents, the\nCongress-retrieved ER copies, used for the proclamation of the\nprotestee by the NBC, are authentic and duly executed in the regular\ncourse of official business. The evidence adduced by protestee to show\nthat the supposed security features and markings in the\nCongress-retrieved ERs and the COMELEC/NAMFREL’s copies are different,\ndid not categorically establish that the Congress-retrieved ERs are\nfake and spurious. To overcome the presumption of regularity, there\nmust be evidence that is clear, convincing and more than merely\npreponderant. Absent such convincing evidence, the presumption must be\nupheld. [41] In fact, the records show that even the witnesses presented by the\nprotestant testified that they were able to discern security features\nand markings in the Congress-retrieved ERs. The records also show that\nwitnesses were not made to examine all Congress-retrieved ERs in making\nobservations relative to security features and markings, but only a\nsample set thereof was utilized, resulting in grave insufficiency in\nthe evidence presented by protestant.\n\nAs to the alleged break-in in Congress, which allegedly facilitated the\nswitching of ERs, no conclusive evidence has been given. One of the\nprotestant’s own witnesses, Atty. Artemio Adasa, Deputy General for\nLegislative Operations of the House of Representatives, categorically\ndenied that a break-in and a switching of ERs had occurred in Congress. [42]\n\nAt any rate, as pointed out by protestee, even assuming arguendo that\nall the votes in the 497 precincts included in the pilot areas for the First Aspect with approximately 99,400 votes are considered in favor of protestant,\nstill the protestant would not be able to overcome the lead of the\nprotestee. The margin in favor of protestee adds up to a total of\n881,722 votes, and it would take much more than a hundred thousand\nvotes to overcome this lead. This is what the protestant had set out to\ndo in her protest before the Tribunal, but unfortunately she failed to\nmake out her case. [43] In\nfact, Taraka and Balindong, the only two municipalities on which\nprotestant anchors her arguments for the First Aspect, would only yield\nan additional 9,931 votes (4,912 votes for Taraka and 5,019 votes for\nBalindong), a mere fraction of the lead of protestee over protestant.\nTo say that she could have shown that such fraudulent machination was\nreplicated in several other municipalities of Lanao del Sur and other\nprovinces, such as Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Maguindanao, Sultan\nKudarat and Lanao del Sur if she had enough time, is mere conjecture\nand can not be considered convincing by this Tribunal. It is the\nprotestant herself who admits that she was able to adduce evidence only\nin Taraka and Balindong, for lack of time. But this Tribunal has been\nliberal in granting her plea for time extension. To say that the\nprotestant had shown enough evidence to prove that the whole or even\nhalf (440,862) [44] of the\nlead of the protestee over the protestant is spurious, would go against\nthe grain of the evidence on hand. One cannot say that half a million\nvotes were illegally obtained based on unclear evidence of cheating in\nless than ten thousand. The protestant has been afforded ample\nopportunity to adduce evidence in her behalf for the First Aspect of\nthe protest but the evidence presented is simply insufficient to\nconvince the Tribunal to render invalid all or even half of the 881,722\nvotes that protestee had over her in the last elections for\nVice-President.\n\nWHEREFORE, the First Aspect of the protest is hereby DISMISSED for lack of legal and factual basis, as the pilot-tested revision of\nballots or re-tabulation of the certificates of canvass would not\naffect the winning margin of the protestee in the final canvass of the\nreturns, in addition to the ground of abandonment or withdrawal by\nreason of protestant’s candidacy for, election to and assumption of the\noffice of Senator of the Philippines. The Second Aspect, having been already DISMISSED on June 5, 2007, pursuant to Rule 33 of this Tribunal, the entire Protest is now deemed DISMISSED and TERMINATED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Azcuna, Tinga, Nachura, Reyes, and Leonardo-De Castro, JJ., concur.\nYnares-Santiago, J., No part.\nCarpio, J., I concur but on ground of abandonment alone.\nChico-Nazario, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., On leave.\n\n[1] PET rollo, Vol. I, pp. 39-41.\n\n[2] Id. at 3-36.\n\n[3] Id. at 9-11.\n\n[4] Id. at 11-13.\n\n[5] Id. at 511.\n\n[6] Id. at 514-516.\n\n[7] Id. at 10; 527.\n\n[8] Id. at 660.\n\n[9] PET rollo, Vol. II, pp. 1007-1010.\n\n[10] Id. at 1059-1061.\n\n[11] Id. at 1753, August 1, 2006 PET Resolution. x x x x\n\nA.
