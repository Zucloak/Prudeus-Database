  "title": "SPOUSES ANTONIO AND LUZVIMINDA GUIANG, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND GILDA CORPUZ, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: The sale of a conjugal property requires the consent of both the husband and the wife. The absence of the consent of one renders the sale null and void, while the vitiation thereof makes it merely voidable. Only in the latter case can ratification cure the defect. The Case These were the principles that guided the Court in deciding this petition for review of the Decision[1] dated January 30, 1996 and the Resolution[2] dated May 28, 1996, promulgated by the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CV No. 41758, affirming the Decision of the lower court and denying reconsideration, respectively. On May 28, 1990, Private Respondent Gilda Corpuz filed an Amended Complaint[3] against her husband Judie Corpuz and Petitioners-Spouses Antonio and Luzviminda Guiang. The said Complaint sought the declaration of a certain deed of sale, which involved the conjugal property of private respondent and her husband, null and void. The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court of Koronadal, South Cotabato, Branch 25. In due course, the trial court rendered a Decision[4] dated September 9, 1992, disposing as follows:[5] âACCORDINGLY, judgment is rendered for the plaintiff and against the defendants, 1. Declaring both the Deed of Transfer of Rights dated March 1, 1990 (Exh. âAâ) and the âamicable settlementâ dated March 16, 1990 (Exh. âBâ) as null and void and of no effect; 2. Recognizing as lawful and valid the ownership and possession of plaintiff Gilda Corpuz over the remaining one-half portion of Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409 which has been the subject of the Deed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. âAâ); 3. Ordering plaintiff Gilda Corpuz to reimburse defendants Luzviminda and Antonio Guiang the amount of NINE THOUSAND (P9,000.00) PESOS corresponding to the payment made by defendants Guiangs to Manuel Callejo for the unpaid balance of the account of plaintiff in favor of Manuel Callejo, and another sum of P379.62 representing one-half of the amount of realty taxes paid by defendants Guiangs on Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409, both with legal interests thereon computed from the finality of the decision. No pronouncement as to costs in view of the factual circumstances of the case.â Dissatisfied, petitioners-spouses filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals. Respondent Court, in its challenged Decision, ruled as follows:[6] âWHEREFORE, the appealed decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 204 is hereby AFFIRMED by this Court. No costs considering plaintiff-appelleeâs failure to file her brief, despite notice.â Reconsideration was similarly denied by the same court in its assailed Resolution:[7] âFinding that the issues raised in defendants-appellantsâ motion for reconsideration of Our decision in this case of January 30, 1996, to be a mere rehash of the same issues which We have already passed upon in the said decision, and there [being] no cogent reason to disturb the same, this Court RESOLVES to DENY the instant motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.â The Facts The facts of this case are simple. Over the objection of private respondent and while she was in Manila seeking employment, her husband sold to the petitioners-spouses one half of their conjugal property, consisting of their residence and the lot on which it stood. The circumstances of this sale are set forth in the Decision of Respondent Court, which quoted from the Decision of the trial court, as follows:[8] â1. Plaintiff Gilda Corpuz and defendant Judie Corpuz are legally married spouses. They were married on December 24, 1968 in Bacolod City, before a judge. This is admitted by defendants-spouses Antonio and Luzviminda Guiang in their answer, and also admitted by defendant Judie Corpuz when he testified in court (tsn. p..3, June 9, 1992), although the latter says that they were married in 1967. The couple have three children, namely: Junie â 18 years old, Harriet â 17 years of age, and Jodie or Joji, the youngest, who was 15 years of age in August, 1990 when her mother testified in court. Sometime on February 14, 1983, the couple Gilda and Judie Corpuz, with plaintiff-wife Gilda Corpuz as vendee, bought a 421 sq. meter lot located in Barangay Gen. Paulino Santos (Bo. 1), Koronadal, South Cotabato, and particularly known as Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409 from Manuel Callejo who signed as vendor through a conditional deed of sale for a total consideration of P14,735.00. The consideration was payable in installment, with right of cancellation in favor of vendor should vendee fail to pay three successive installments (Exh. â2â, tsn. p. 6, February 14, 1990). 2. Sometime on April 22, 1988, the couple Gilda and Judie Corpuz sold one-half portion of their Lot No. 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409 to the defendants-spouses Antonio and Luzviminda Guiang. The latter have since then occupied the one-half portion [and] built their house thereon (tsn. p. 4, May 22, 1992). They are thus adjoining neighbors of the Corpuzes. 3. Plaintiff Gilda Corpuz left for Manila sometime in June 1989. She was trying to look for work abroad, in [the] Middle East. Unfortunately, she became a victim of an unscrupulous illegal recruiter. She was not able to go abroad. She stayed for sometime in Manila however, coming back to Koronadal, South Cotabato, x x x on March 11, 1990. Plaintiffâs departure for Manila to look for work in the Middle East was with the consent of her husband Judie Corpuz (tsn. p. 16, Aug.12, 1990; p. 10, Sept. 6, 1991). After his wifeâs departure for Manila, defendant Judie Corpuz seldom went home to the conjugal dwelling. He stayed most of the time at his place of work at Samahang Nayon Building, a hotel, restaurant, and a cooperative. Daughter Harriet Corpuz went to school at Kingâs College, Bo. 1, Koronadal, South Cotabato, but she was at the same time working as household help of, and staying at, the house of Mr. Panes. Her brother Junie was not working. Her younger sister Jodie (Joji) was going to school. Her mother sometimes sent them money (tsn. p. 14, Sept. 6, 1991). Sometime in January 1990, Harriet Corpuz learned that her father intended to sell the remaining one-half portion including their house, of their homelot to defendants Guiangs. She wrote a letter to her mother informing her. She [Gilda Corpuz] replied that she was objecting to the sale. Harriet, however, did not inform her father about this; but instead gave the letter to Mrs. Luzviminda Guiang so that she [Guiang] would advise her father (tsn. pp. 16-17, Sept. 6, 1991). 4. However, in the absence of his wife Gilda Corpuz, defendant Judie Corpuz pushed through the sale of the remaining one-half portion of Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409. On March 1, 1990, he sold to defendant Luzviminda Guiang thru a document known as âDeed of Transfer of Rightsâ (Exh. âAâ) the remaining one-half portion of their lot and the house standing thereon for a total consideration of P30,000.00 of which P5,000.00 was to be paid in June , 1990. Transferor Judie Corpuzâs children Junie and Harriet signed the document as witnesses. Four (4) days after March 1, 1990 or on March 5, 1990, obviously to cure whatever defect in defendant Judie Corpuzâs title over the lot transferred, defendant Luzviminda Guiang as vendee executed another agreement over Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165408 (Exh. â3â), this time with Manuela Jimenez Callejo, a widow of the original registered owner from whom the couple Judie and Gilda Corpuz originally bought the lot (Exh. â2â), who signed as vendor for a consideration of P9,000.00. Defendant Judie Corpuz signed as a witness to the sale (Exh. â3-Aâ). The new sale (Exh. â3â) describes the lot sold as Lot 8, Block 9, (LRC) Psd-165408 but it is obvious from the mass of evidence that the correct lot is Lot 8, Block 9, (LRC) Psd-165409, the very lot earlier sold to the couple Gilda and Judie Corpuz. 5. Sometime on March 11, 1990, plaintiff returned home. She found her children staying with other households. Only Junie was staying in their house. Harriet and Joji were with Mr. Panes. Gilda gathered her children together and stayed at their house. Her husband was nowhere to be found. She was informed by her children that their father had a wife already. 6. For staying in their house sold by her husband, plaintiff was complained against by defendant Luzviminda Guiang and her husband Antonio Guiang before the Barangay authorities of Barangay General Paulino Santos (Bo. 1), Koronadal, South Cotabato, for trespassing (tsn. p. 34, Aug. 17, 1990). The case was docketed by the barangay authorities as Barangay Case No. 38 for âtrespassingâ. On March 16, 1990, the parties thereat signed a document known as âamicable settlementâ. In full, the settlement provides for, to wit: âThat respondent, Mrs. Gilda Corpuz and her three children, namely: Junie, Hariet and Judie to leave voluntarily the house of Mr. and Mrs. Antonio Guiang, where they are presently boarding without any charge, on or before April 7, 1990. FAIL NOT UNDER THE PENALTY OF THE LAW.â Believing that she had received the shorter end of the bargain, plaintiff went to the Barangay Captain of Barangay Paulino Santos to question her signature on the amicable settlement. She was referred however to the Officer-In-Charge at the time, a certain Mr. de la Cruz. The latter in turn told her that he could not do anything on the matter (tsn. p. 31, Aug. 17, 1990). This particular point was not rebutted. The Barangay Captain who testified did not deny that Mrs. Gilda Corpuz approached him for the annulment of the settlement. He merely said he forgot whether Mrs. Corpuz had approached him (tsn. p. 13, Sept. 26, 1990). We thus conclude that Mrs. Corpuz really approached the Barangay Captain for the annulment of the settlement. Annulment not having been made, plaintiff stayed put in her house and lot. 7. Defendant-spouses Guiang followed thru the amicable settlement with a motion for the execution of the amicable settlement, filing the same with the Municipal Trial Court of Koronadal, South Cotabato. The proceedings [are] still pending before the said court, with the filing of the instant suit. 8. As a consequence of the sale, the spouses Guiang spent P600.00 for the preparation of the Deed of Transfer of Rights, Exh. âAâ; P9,000.00 as the amount they paid to Mrs. Manuela Callejo, having assumed the remaining obligation of the Corpuzes to Mrs. Callejo (Exh. â3â); P100.00 for the preparation of Exhibit â3â; a total of P759.62 basic tax and special educational fund on the lot; P127.50 as the total documentary stamp tax on the various documents; P535.72 for the capital gains tax; P22.50 as transfer tax; a standard fee of P17.00; certification fee of P5.00. These expenses particularly the taxes and other expenses towards the transfer of the title to the spouses Guiangs were incurred for the whole Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409.â Ruling of Respondent Court Respondent Court found no reversible error in the trial courtâs ruling that any alienation or encumbrance by the husband of the conjugal property without the consent of his wife is null and void as provided under Article 124 of the Family Code. It also rejected petitionersâ contention that the âamicable settlementâ ratified said sale, citing Article 1409 of the Code which expressly bars ratification of the contracts specified therein, particularly those âprohibited or declared void by law.â Hence, this petition.[9] The Issues In their Memorandum, petitioners assign to public respondent the following errors:[10] âI Whether or not the assailed Deed of Transfer of Rights was validly executed. II Whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in not declaring as voidable contract under Art. 1390 of the Civil Code the impugned Deed of Transfer of Rights which was validly ratified thru the execution of the âamicable settlementâ by the contending parties. III Whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in not setting aside the findings of the Court a quo which recognized as lawful and valid the ownership and possession of private respondent over the remaining one half (1/2) portion of the subject property.â In a nutshell, petitioners-spouses contend that (1) the contract of sale (Deed of Transfer of Rights) was merely voidable, and (2) such contract was ratified by private respondent when she entered into an amicable settlement with them. This Courtâs Ruling The petition is bereft of merit. First Issue: Void or Voidable Contract? Petitioners insist that the questioned Deed of Transfer of Rights was validly executed by the parties-litigants in good faith and for valuable consideration. The absence of private respondentâs consent merely rendered the Deed voidable under Article 1390 of the Civil Code, which provides: âART. 1390. The following contracts are voidable or annullable, even though there may have been no damage to the contracting parties: xxx xxx xxx (2) Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud. These contracts are binding, unless they are annulled by a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification.(n)â The error in petitionersâ contention is evident. Article 1390, par. 2, refers to contracts visited by vices of consent, i.e., contracts which were entered into by a person whose consent was obtained and vitiated through mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud. In this instance, private respondentâs consent to the contract of sale of their conjugal property was totally inexistent or absent. Gilda Corpuz, on direct examination, testified thus:[11] âQ Now, on March 1, 1990, could you still recall where you were? A I was still in Manila during that time. xxx xxx xxx ATTY. FUENTES: Q When did you come back to Koronadal, South Cotabato? A That was on March 11, 1990, Maâam. Q Now, when you arrived at Koronadal, was there any problem which arose concerning the ownership of your residential house at Callejo Subdivision? A When I arrived here in Koronadal, there was a problem which arose regarding my residential house and lot because it was sold by my husband without my knowledge.â This being the case, said contract properly falls within the ambit of Article 124 of the Family Code, which was correctly applied by the two lower courts: âART. 124. The administration and enjoyment of the conjugal partnership property shall belong to both spouses jointly. In case of disagreement, the husbandâs decision shall prevail, subject to recourse to the court by the wife for proper remedy, which must be availed of within five years from the date of the contract implementing such decision. In the event that one spouse is incapacitated or otherwise unable to participate in the administration of the conjugal properties, the other spouse may assume sole powers of administration. These powers do not include the powers of disposition or encumbrance which must have the authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse. In the absence of such authority or consent, the disposition or encumbrance shall be void. However, the transaction shall be construed as a continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person, and may be perfected as a binding contract upon the acceptance by the other spouse or authorization by the court before the offer is withdrawn by either or both offerors.(165a)â (Italics supplied) Comparing said law with its equivalent provision in the Civil Code, the trial court adroitly explained the amendatory effect of the above provision in this wise:[12] âThe legal provision is clear. The disposition or encumbrance is void. It becomes still clearer if we compare the same with the equivalent provision of the Civil Code of the Philippines. Under Article 166 of the Civil Code, the husband cannot generally alienate or encumber any real property of the conjugal partnership without the wifeâs consent. The alienation or encumbrance if so made however is not null and void. It is merely voidable. The offended wife may bring an action to annul the said alienation or encumbrance. Thus, the provision of Article 173 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, to wit: âArt. 173. The wife may, during the marriage and within ten years from the transaction questioned, ask the courts for the annulment of any contract of the husband entered into without her consent, when such consent is required, or any act or contract of the husband which tends to defraud her or impair her interest in the conjugal partnership property. Should the wife fail to exercise this right, she or her heirs after the dissolution of the marriage, may demand the value of property fraudulently alienated by the husband.(n)â This particular provision giving the wife ten (10) years x x x during [the] marriage to annul the alienation or encumbrance was not carried over to the Family Code. It is thus clear that any alienation or encumbrance made after August 3, 1988 when the Family Code took effect by the husband of the conjugal partnership property without the consent of the wife is null and void.â Furthermore, it must be noted that the fraud and the intimidation referred to by petitioners were perpetrated in the execution of the document embodying the amicable settlement. Gilda Corpuz alleged during trial that barangay authorities made her sign said document through misrepresentation and coercion.[13] In any event, its execution does not alter the void character of the deed of sale between the husband and the petitioners-spouses, as will be discussed later. The fact remains that such contract was entered into without the wifeâs consent. In sum, the nullity of the contract of sale is premised on the absence of private respondentâs consent. To constitute a valid contract, the Civil Code requires the concurrence of the following elements: (1) cause, (2) object, and (3) consent,[14] the last element being indubitably absent in the case at bar. Second Issue: Amicable Settlement Insisting that the contract of sale was merely voidable, petitioners aver that it was duly ratified by the contending parties through the âamicable settlementâ they executed on March 16, 1990 in Barangay Case No. 38. The position is not well taken. The trial and the appellate courts have resolved this issue in favor of the private respondent. The trial court correctly held:[15] âBy the specific provision of the law [Art. 1390, Civil Code] therefore, the Deed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. âAâ) cannot be ratified, even by an âamicable settlementâ. The participation by some barangay authorities in the âamicable settlementâ cannot otherwise validate an invalid act. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the âamicable settlementâ (Exh. âBâ) entered into by plaintiff Gilda Corpuz and defendant spouses Guiang is a contract. It is a direct offshoot of the Deed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. âAâ). By express provision of law, such a contract is also void. Thus, the legal provision, to wit: âArt. 1422. A contract which is the direct result of a previous illegal contract, is also void and inexistent.â (Civil Code of the Philippines). In summation therefore, both the Deed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. âAâ) and the âamicable settlementâ (Exh. â3â) are null and void.â Doctrinally and clearly, a void contract cannot be ratified.[16] Neither can the âamicable settlementâ be considered a continuing offer that was accepted and perfected by the parties, following the last sentence of Article 124. The order of the pertinent events is clear: after the sale, petitioners filed a complaint for trespassing against private respondent, after which the barangay authorities secured an âamicable settlementâ and petitioners filed before the MTC a motion for its execution. The settlement, however, does not mention a continuing offer to sell the property or an acceptance of such a continuing offer. Its tenor was to the effect that private respondent would vacate the property. By no stretch of the imagination, can the Court interpret this document as the acceptance mentioned in Article 124. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby DENIES the petition and AFFIRMS the challenged Decision and Resolution. Costs against petitioners. SO ORDERED.

Plaintiffâs departure for Manila to look for work in the Middle \nEast was with the consent of her husband Judie Corpuz (tsn. p. 16, \nAug.12, 1990; p. 10, Sept. 6, 1991).\n\nAfter his wifeâs departure for Manila, defendant Judie Corpuz \nseldom went home to the conjugal dwelling. He stayed most of the time at\n his place of work at Samahang Nayon Building, a hotel, restaurant, and a\n cooperative. Daughter Harriet Corpuz went to school at Kingâs College, \nBo. 1, Koronadal, South Cotabato, but she was at the same time working \nas household help of, and staying at, the house of Mr. Panes. Her \nbrother Junie was not working. Her younger sister Jodie (Joji) was going\n to school. Her mother sometimes sent them money (tsn. p. 14, Sept. 6, \n1991).\n\nSometime in January 1990, Harriet Corpuz learned that her father \nintended to sell the remaining one-half portion including their house, \nof their homelot to defendants Guiangs. She wrote a letter to her mother\n informing her. She [Gilda Corpuz] replied that she was objecting to the\n sale. Harriet, however, did not inform her father about this; but \ninstead gave the letter to Mrs. Luzviminda Guiang so that she [Guiang] \nwould advise her father (tsn. pp. 16-17, Sept. 6, 1991).\n\n4. However, in the absence of his wife Gilda Corpuz, \ndefendant Judie Corpuz pushed through the sale of the remaining one-half\n portion of Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409. On March 1, 1990, he sold \nto defendant Luzviminda Guiang thru a document known as âDeed of \nTransfer of Rightsâ (Exh. âAâ) the remaining one-half portion of their \nlot and the house standing thereon for a total consideration of \nP30,000.00 of which P5,000.00 was to be paid in June , 1990. Transferor \nJudie Corpuzâs children Junie and Harriet signed the document as \nwitnesses.\n\nFour (4) days after March 1, 1990 or on March 5, 1990, obviously to\n cure whatever defect in defendant Judie Corpuzâs title over the lot \ntransferred, defendant Luzviminda Guiang as vendee executed another \nagreement over Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165408 (Exh. â3â), this time \nwith Manuela Jimenez Callejo, a widow of the original registered owner \nfrom whom the couple Judie and Gilda Corpuz originally bought the lot \n(Exh. â2â), who signed as vendor for a consideration of P9,000.00. \nDefendant Judie Corpuz signed as a witness to the sale (Exh. â3-Aâ). The\n new sale (Exh. â3â) describes the lot sold as Lot 8, Block 9, (LRC) \nPsd-165408 but it is obvious from the mass of evidence that the correct \nlot is Lot 8, Block 9, (LRC) Psd-165409, the very lot earlier sold to \nthe couple Gilda and Judie Corpuz.\n\n5. Sometime on March 11, 1990, plaintiff returned home. She \nfound her children staying with other households. Only Junie was staying\n in their house. Harriet and Joji were with Mr. Panes. Gilda gathered \nher children together and stayed at their house. Her husband was nowhere\n to be found. She was informed by her children that their father had a \nwife already.\n\n6. For staying in their house sold by her husband, plaintiff\n was complained against by defendant Luzviminda Guiang and her husband \nAntonio Guiang before the Barangay authorities of Barangay General \nPaulino Santos (Bo. 1), Koronadal, South Cotabato, for trespassing (tsn.\n p. 34, Aug. 17, 1990). The case was docketed by the barangay \nauthorities as Barangay Case No. 38 for âtrespassingâ. On March 16, \n1990, the parties thereat signed a document known as âamicable \nsettlementâ. In full, the settlement provides for, to wit:\n\nâThat respondent, Mrs. Gilda Corpuz and her three children, \nnamely: Junie, Hariet and Judie to leave voluntarily the house of Mr. \nand Mrs. Antonio Guiang, where they are presently boarding without any \ncharge, on or before April 7, 1990.\n\nFAIL NOT UNDER THE PENALTY OF THE LAW.â\n\nBelieving that she had received the shorter end of the bargain, \nplaintiff went to the Barangay Captain of Barangay Paulino Santos to \nquestion her signature on the amicable settlement. She was referred \nhowever to the Officer-In-Charge at the time, a certain Mr. de la Cruz. \nThe latter in turn told her that he could not do anything on the matter \n(tsn. p. 31, Aug. 17, 1990).\n\nThis particular point was not rebutted. The Barangay Captain who \ntestified did not deny that Mrs. Gilda Corpuz approached him for the \nannulment of the settlement. He merely said he forgot whether Mrs. \nCorpuz had approached him (tsn. p. 13, Sept. 26, 1990). We thus conclude\n that Mrs. Corpuz really approached the Barangay Captain for the \nannulment of the settlement. Annulment not having been made, plaintiff \nstayed put in her house and lot.\n\n7. Defendant-spouses Guiang followed thru the amicable \nsettlement with a motion for the execution of the amicable settlement, \nfiling the same with the Municipal Trial Court of Koronadal, South \nCotabato. The proceedings [are] still pending before the said court, \nwith the filing of the instant suit.\n\n8. As a consequence of the sale, the spouses Guiang spent \nP600.00 for the preparation of the Deed of Transfer of Rights, Exh. âAâ;\n P9,000.00 as the amount they paid to Mrs. Manuela Callejo, having \nassumed the remaining obligation of the Corpuzes to Mrs. Callejo (Exh. \nâ3â); P100.00 for the preparation of Exhibit â3â; a total of P759.62 \nbasic tax and special educational fund on the lot; P127.50 as the total \ndocumentary stamp tax on the various documents; P535.72 for the capital \ngains tax; P22.50 as transfer tax; a standard fee of P17.00; \ncertification fee of P5.00. These expenses particularly the taxes and \nother expenses towards the transfer of the title to the spouses Guiangs \nwere incurred for the whole Lot 9, Block 8, (LRC) Psd-165409.â\n\nRuling of Respondent Court\n\nRespondent Court found no reversible error in the trial courtâs \nruling that any alienation or encumbrance by the husband of the conjugal\n property without the consent of his wife is null and void as provided \nunder Article 124 of the Family Code. It also rejected petitionersâ \ncontention that the âamicable settlementâ ratified said sale, citing \nArticle 1409 of the Code which expressly bars ratification of the \ncontracts specified therein, particularly those âprohibited or declared \nvoid by law.â\n\nHence, this petition. [9]\n\nThe Issues\n\nIn their Memorandum, petitioners assign to public respondent the following errors: [10]\n\nâI\n\nWhether or not the assailed Deed of Transfer of Rights was validly executed.\n\nII\n\nWhether or not the Court of Appeals erred in not declaring as \nvoidable contract under Art. 1390 of the Civil Code the impugned Deed of\n Transfer of Rights which was validly ratified thru the execution of the\n âamicable settlementâ by the contending parties.\n\nIII\n\nWhether or not the Court of Appeals erred in not setting aside the \nfindings of the Court a quo which recognized as lawful and valid the \nownership and possession of private respondent over the remaining one \nhalf (1/2) portion of the subject property.â\n\nIn a nutshell, petitioners-spouses contend that (1) the contract of \nsale (Deed of Transfer of Rights) was merely voidable, and (2) such \ncontract was ratified by private respondent when she entered into an \namicable settlement with them.\n\nThis Courtâs Ruling\n\nThe petition is bereft of merit.\n\nFirst Issue: Void or Voidable Contract?\n\nPetitioners insist that the questioned Deed of Transfer of Rights\n was validly executed by the parties-litigants in good faith and for \nvaluable consideration. The absence of private respondentâs consent \nmerely rendered the Deed voidable under Article 1390 of the Civil Code, \nwhich provides:\n\nâART. 1390. The following contracts are voidable or annullable, \neven though there may have been no damage to the contracting parties:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud.\n\nThese contracts are binding, unless they are annulled by a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification.(n)â\n\nThe error in petitionersâ contention is evident. Article 1390, par. 2, refers to contracts visited by vices of consent, i.e. ,\n contracts which were entered into by a person whose consent was \nobtained and vitiated through mistake, violence, intimidation, undue \ninfluence or fraud. In this instance, private respondentâs consent to \nthe contract of sale of their conjugal property was totally inexistent \nor absent. Gilda Corpuz, on direct examination, testified thus: [11]\n\nâQ Now, on March 1, 1990, could you still recall where you were?\n\nA I was still in Manila during that time.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nATTY. FUENTES:\n\nQ When did you come back to Koronadal, South Cotabato?\n\nA That was on March 11, 1990, Maâam.\n\nQ Now, when you arrived at Koronadal, was there any problem \nwhich arose concerning the ownership of your residential house at \nCallejo Subdivision?\n\nA When I arrived here in Koronadal, there was a problem which \narose regarding my residential house and lot because it was sold by my \nhusband without my knowledge.â\n\nThis being the case, said contract properly falls within the ambit of\n Article 124 of the Family Code, which was correctly applied by the two \nlower courts:\n\nâART. 124. The administration and enjoyment of the conjugal \npartnership property shall belong to both spouses jointly. In case of \ndisagreement, the husbandâs decision shall prevail, subject to recourse \nto the court by the wife for proper remedy, which must be availed of \nwithin five years from the date of the contract implementing such \ndecision.\n\nIn the event that one spouse is incapacitated or otherwise unable \nto participate in the administration of the conjugal properties, the \nother spouse may assume sole powers of administration. These powers do \nnot include the powers of disposition or encumbrance which must have the\n authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse. In the absence of such authority or consent, the disposition or encumbrance shall be void .\n However, the transaction shall be construed as a continuing offer on \nthe part of the consenting spouse and the third person, and may be \nperfected as a binding contract upon the acceptance by the other spouse \nor authorization by the court before the offer is withdrawn by either or\n both offerors.(165a)â (Italics supplied)\n\nComparing said law with its equivalent provision in the Civil Code, \nthe trial court adroitly explained the amendatory effect of the above \nprovision in this wise: [12]\n\nâThe legal provision is clear. The disposition or encumbrance is \nvoid. It becomes still clearer if we compare the same with the \nequivalent provision of the Civil Code of the Philippines. Under Article\n 166 of the Civil Code, the husband cannot generally alienate or \nencumber any real property of the conjugal partnership without the \nwifeâs consent. The alienation or encumbrance if so made however is not \nnull and void. It is merely voidable. The offended wife may bring an \naction to annul the said alienation or encumbrance. Thus, the provision \nof Article 173 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, to wit:\n\nâArt. 173. The wife may, during the marriage and within ten years\n from the transaction questioned, ask the courts for the annulment of \nany contract of the husband entered into without her consent, when such \nconsent is required, or any act or contract of the husband which tends \nto defraud her or impair her interest in the conjugal partnership \nproperty. Should the wife fail to exercise this right, she or her heirs \nafter the dissolution of the marriage, may demand the value of property \nfraudulently alienated by the husband.(n)â\n\nThis particular provision giving the wife ten (10) years x x x \nduring [the] marriage to annul the alienation or encumbrance was not \ncarried over to the Family Code. It is thus clear that any alienation or\n encumbrance made after August 3, 1988 when the Family Code took effect \nby the husband of the conjugal partnership property without the consent \nof the wife is null and void.â\n\nFurthermore, it must be noted that the fraud and the intimidation \nreferred to by petitioners were perpetrated in the execution of the \ndocument embodying the amicable settlement. Gilda Corpuz alleged during \ntrial that barangay authorities made her sign said document through \nmisrepresentation and coercion. [13] In any event, its execution does not alter the void character of the \ndeed of sale between the husband and the petitioners-spouses, as will be\n discussed later. The fact remains that such contract was entered into \nwithout the wifeâs consent.\n\nIn sum, the nullity of the contract of sale is premised on the \nabsence of private respondentâs consent. To constitute a valid contract,\n the Civil Code requires the concurrence of the following elements: (1) \ncause, (2) object, and (3) consent, [14] the last element being indubitably absent in the case at bar.\n\nSecond Issue: Amicable Settlement\n\nInsisting that the contract of sale was merely voidable, \npetitioners aver that it was duly ratified by the contending parties \nthrough the âamicable settlementâ they executed on March 16, 1990 in \nBarangay Case No. 38.\n\nThe position is not well taken. The trial and the appellate \ncourts have resolved this issue in favor of the private respondent. The \ntrial court correctly held: [15]\n\nâBy the specific provision of the law [Art. 1390, Civil Code] \ntherefore, the Deed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. âAâ) cannot be ratified,\n even by an âamicable settlementâ. The participation by some barangay \nauthorities in the âamicable settlementâ cannot otherwise validate an \ninvalid act. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the âamicable \nsettlementâ (Exh. âBâ) entered into by plaintiff Gilda Corpuz and \ndefendant spouses Guiang is a contract. It is a direct offshoot of the \nDeed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. âAâ). By express provision of law, such\n a contract is also void. Thus, the legal provision, to wit:\n\nâArt. 1422. A contract which is the direct result of a previous \nillegal contract, is also void and inexistent.â (Civil Code of the \nPhilippines).\n\nIn summation therefore, both the Deed of Transfer of Rights (Exh. \nâAâ) and the âamicable settlementâ (Exh. â3â) are null and void.â\n\nDoctrinally and clearly, a void contract cannot be ratified. [16]\n\nNeither can the âamicable settlementâ be considered a continuing \noffer that was accepted and perfected by the parties, following the last\n sentence of Article 124. The order of the pertinent events is clear: \nafter the sale, petitioners filed a complaint for trespassing against \nprivate respondent, after which the barangay authorities secured an \nâamicable settlementâ and petitioners filed before the MTC a motion for \nits execution. The settlement, however, does not mention a continuing \noffer to sell the property or an acceptance of such a continuing offer. \nIts tenor was to the effect that private respondent would vacate the \nproperty. By no stretch of the imagination, can the Court interpret this\n document as the acceptance mentioned in Article 124.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court hereby DENIES the petition and AFFIRMS the challenged Decision and Resolution.
