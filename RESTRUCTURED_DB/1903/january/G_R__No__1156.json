No. 1156            January 5, 1903\n\nISABELO DE LOS REYES,\n\npetitioner,\n\nvs.\n\nFELIX M. ROXAS, judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal,\n\nrespondent.\n\nRafael Palma, for petitioner.\n\nFelix M. Roxas, respondent.\n\nWILLARD,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe complaint in this case does not allege that the court which convicted the petitioner had no jurisdiction to try the case. Neither does it allege that in the prosecution of the case there has been any affirmative action by the judge outside of his jurisdiction. It simply alleges that he has failed to take action; that he has refused to hear the witnesses for the defendant. This, if true, would constitute error, but it would be error committed by the judge in the exercise of a jurisdiction which he possessed. The remedy by\n\ncertiorari\n\ndoes not apply to this case. The petition is denied.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa, and Ladd, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
