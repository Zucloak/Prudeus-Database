  "title": "OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, REPRESENTED BY THE HONORABLE CONCHITA CARPIO MORALES, IN HER CAPACITY AS THE OMBUDSMAN; OMB-TASK FORCE PDAF; AND OMB-PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND CORRUPTON PREVENTION OFFICE, PETITIONERS, VS. OSCAR GONZALES MALAPITAN, RESPONDENT.DECISION LEONEN, J.: The condonation doctrine was abandoned on April 12, 2016, when Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals[1] attained finality. Nonetheless, despite its abandonment, the condonation doctrine can still apply to pending administrative cases[2] provided that the reelection is also before the abandonment. As for cases filed after April 12, 2016, the impleaded public official can no longer resort to the condonation doctrine.[3] This Court resolves a Petition for Review[4] assailing the Decision[5] and Resolution[6] of the Court of Appeals, which nullified the Office of the Ombudsman Orders granting the amendment to implead Oscar Gonzales Malapitan (Malapitan), an elected public official, in an administrative complaint. Malapitan was the Caloocan City First District Representative from 2004 to 2007. He was reelected from 2007 to 2010 and again from 2010 to 2013. In 2013, he became the Caloocan City mayor, and was reelected in 2016.[7] He is the incumbent mayor, having been reelected in 2019.[8] On February 16, 2015, the Office of the Ombudsman's Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office filed a criminal complaint for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, against the following public officials: (1) Esperanza I. Cabral, as the Department of Social Welfare and Development Secretary in 2009; (2) Mateo G. Montaño, as the current DSWD Undersecretary for General Administration and Support Services Group (GASSG); (3) Luwalhati F. Pablo, as the former Undersecretary for GASSG; (4) Vilma B. Cabrera, as the present DSWD Assistant Secretary for Institutional Development Group; (5) Pacita D. Sarino, as the current DSWD Director III of the Program Management Bureau; (6) Leonila M. Hayahay, as the former DSWD Chief Accountant; and (7) Oscar G. Malapitan, as the former Congressman of the 1st District of Caloocan City in 2009 and the current Mayor of Caloocan City.[9] (Emphasis in the original) The criminal complaint arose from the allegedly anomalous use of Malapitan's Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) worth P8,000,000.00. Malapitan, then a district representative, and the other charged officials had approved the PDAF to fund the programs of Kalookan Assistance Council, Inc. in 2009.[10] The criminal complaint also contained an administrative charge for grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service against Mateo G. Montafto, Pacita D. Sarino, and Vilma G. Cabrera, three of the charged officials. Malapitan was not impleaded in the administrative complaint.[11] On January 22, 2016, the Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office filed a Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint,[12] asking that Malapitan be impleaded in the administrative complaint after he had been inadvertently left out as a respondent.[13] On February 22, 2016,[14] the Office of the Ombudsman's Task Force PDAF granted the motion. Malapitan moved for reconsideration[15] of this Order, but the Task Force PDAF denied his motion.[16] This denial prompted Malapitan to file a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition[17] before the Court of Appeals. On August 31, 2016, the Court of Appeals granted[18] the Petition. It revisited the history of the condonation doctrine in jurisprudence[19] until it was abandoned in Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals[20] on November 10, 2015.[21] The Court of Appeals pointed out that such abandonment applied prospectively.[22] It then ruled that since Malapitan's alleged misconduct was committed in 2009, the condonation doctrine applied to his case.[23] The Court of Appeals held that under the condonation doctrine, Malapitan's election as mayor right after his term as Caloocan representative was a form of condonation from the voting public: Also relevant to stress is that the same act subject of the administrative complaint was contracted by Malapitan as the representative of the 1st District of Caloocan City at the House of Representative[s]. However, when he was elected as the Mayor of the City of Caloocan in the 2013 elections, whatever wrongful act or misconduct, if any, committed by him during his previous term as Congressman that might give rise to an administrative liability, was impliedly remitted and disregarded by the electoral process following the condonation doctrine set forth in our jurisprudence. For this reason alone, We find no justification to sustain the continuation of the administrative proceedings against Malapitan as he could no longer be held administratively liable for the act upon which he was administratively charged. The administrative case serves no other purpose than to expose him unnecessarily to the rigors of a full-blown investigation and hearing when, in the end, he would not be held accountable for a misconduct he committed during his prior term of public office. Indeed, it is an exercise in futility to still implead him in the administrative complaint.[24] The Court of Appeals also chided the Office of the Ombudsman for its \"flimsy excuse\" of inadvertently failing to implead Malapitan in the administrative complaint.[25] It declared that the belated amendment to implead Malapitan was clearly brought about by the Carpio Morales ruling, with the Office of the Ombudsman mistakenly believing that there was no longer any legal hindrance to include Malapitan.[26] The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads: FOR THESE REASONS, We GRANT the instant Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition. The Orders dated 22 February 2016 and 18 March 2016 of the Task Force PDAF of the Office of the Ombudsman are NULLIFIED and the latter is enjoined from proceeding with the administrative case docketed as OMB-C-A-15-0042 as against Oscar G. Malapitan. SO ORDERED.[27] (Emphasis in the original) In its January 31, 2017 Resolution,[28] the Court of Appeals dismissed the Office of the Ombudsman's Motion for Reconsideration. In this Petition for Review on Certiorari,[29] petitioners Office of the Ombudsman, Task Force PDAF, and the Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office allege that the Court of Appeals encroached on the Office of the Ombudsman's administrative disciplinary authority when it nullified the Orders of Task Force PDAF. Petitioners further claim that the proper remedy was for respondent Malapitan to file a counter-affidavit before the Task Force PDAF and not the extraordinary remedies of certiorari and prohibition before the Court of Appeals.[30] Petitioners assert that respondent filed his Counter-Affidavit two months before he filed his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition before the Court of Appeals, thus mooting the latter. Furthermore, they point out that since respondent actively participated in the administrative proceedings before filing his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition, he had already submitted himself to the Office of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.[31] Petitioners likewise submit that since the Task Force PDAF's Orders were merely interlocutory, the Court of Appeals prematurely resolved the administrative case against respondent on the merits by relying on the condonation doctrine.[32] Nonetheless, petitioners posit that even if the Court of Appeals could rightfully rule on the merits of the administrative case, the condonation doctrine does not apply to respondent because it was abandoned in Carpio Morales, and should no longer apply to cases still pending with the Office of the Ombudsman.[33] Petitioners further maintain that even if Carpio Morales did not abandon the condonation doctrine, it still would not apply to respondent because he committed the alleged act in 2009, when he was a representative, while the complaint was only filed when he was already a mayor, \"a position different from the position he held at the time he committed the acts of complained of.\"[34] In his Comment,[35] respondent cited cases[36] where it was held that courts can review \"the Office of the Ombudsman's exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers\" when there is grave abuse of discretion.[37] Respondent then argues that he could not be impleaded \"because his acts were considered condoned by the electorate upon his re-election.\"[38] He maintains that the condonation doctrine's abandonment is applied prospectively.[39] He also insists that petitioners only sought the amendment to implead him because they had mistakenly thought that Carpio Morales, issued in November 2015, would now work against him in the administrative case originally filed in February 2015.[40] Respondent further argues that his Petition before the Court of Appeals was not rendered moot when he filed his Counter-Affidavit and Verified Position Paper.[41] He said that he \"reserved his right to question\"[42] his inclusion in the administrative case when he filed his Verified Position Paper Ad Cautelam.[43] In addition, respondent argues that the administrative complaint has prescribed.[44] Citing Section 20(5) of Republic Act No. 6770, or the Ombudsman Act of 1989, respondent argues that the Office of the Ombudsman may not investigate any complaint filed more than one year after the act complained of had been committed. From this, he points out that the administrative charges have prescribed because the acts imputed to him were committed in 2009, while the complaint was filed only in 2016.[45] Respondent also cites Section 20(2), in relation to Section 21, of Republic Act No. 6770 and notes that when he committed the alleged acts in 2009, he was still a member of Congress, and thus, outside the Office of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.[46] He then notes that the Commission on Audit has primary jurisdiction over him because the charges involve the use of his PDAF when he was still a district representative.[47] Finally, respondent says that petitioner's late filing of the administrative complaint violates his right to due process and to the speedy disposition of cases.[48] In their Reply,[49] petitioners counter that the filing of an amended complaint is allowed under Administrative Order No. 7 and the Rules of Court. In addition, they point out that respondent filed no responsive pleading when they moved to amend their complaint.[50] Petitioners also maintain that respondent's active participation in the proceedings and filing of several pleadings[51] mooted his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition where he questioned the filing of the amended Complaint.[52] As for respondent's invocation of Section 21 of the Ombudsman Act, petitioners rebut that this is \"not a permanent exception or exclusion\";[53] otherwise, \"there would be no means to fully account for the official's administrative liability.\"[54] Petitioners claim that illegal acts may only be discovered after a public official's term of office.[55] Further, petitioners interpret Section 20(5) of Republic Act No. 6770 differently in that it \"does not refer to the prescription of the offense but to the discretion granted to the Office of the Ombudsman on whether it would investigate a particular administrative offense.\"[56] Petitioners also say that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply because the Commission on Audit's investigation is different from the Office of the Ombudsman's investigation.[57] Finally, petitioners deny that respondent's rights to due process and to the speedy disposition of cases have been violated.[58] He was allegedly given the chance to respond to the allegations against him.[59] They add that respondent himself contributed to the delay he complains of \"by his filing of motions for extension of time and other dilatory and prohibited pleadings before the Office of the Ombudsman and the [Court of Appeals].\"[60] The issues for this Court's resolution are: First, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the condonation doctrine is applicable to respondent Oscar Gonzales Malapitan; Second, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling on respondent's administrative liability, considering that the issue raised before it was whether the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion in granting the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint; and Finally, whether or not the Court of Appeals encroached on the powers of the Office of the Ombudsman when it enjoined the Office of the Ombudsman from proceeding with the administrative case against respondent Oscar Gonzales Malapitan. The Petition is denied. The Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the condonation doctrine applies to respondent Since the act constituting the administrative offense was allegedly committed in 2009, and he was reelected in 2010, the condonation doctrine would still apply. There appears to be confusion as to when the abandonment of the condonation doctrine took effect Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals[61] was rendered on November 10, 2015. After this, on January 22, 2016, the administrative complaint was amended to include respondent, as the condonation doctrine was supposedly no longer available to him. This confusion has long been put to rest in Crebello v. Office of the Ombudsman,[62] where this Court declared the exact date of the abandonment: The abandonment of the doctrine of condonation took effect on April 12, 2016, when the Supreme Court denied with finality the OMB's Motion for Reconsideration in Morales v. Court of Appeals.[63] (Citation omitted) Here, the amended administrative complaint was admitted on February 22, 2016; hence, the condonation doctrine was not yet abandoned. The alleged acts imputed to respondent were supposedly committed in 2009. He was reelected as member of the House of Representatives in 2010.[64] This immediately succeeding victory is what the condonation doctrine looks at. That respondent was later reelected in 2013, 2016, and 2019 would be irrelevant. In Herrera v. Mago,[65] where the public official was reelected in May 2016, after the abandonment of the condonation doctrine had taken effect, this Court ruled that the doctrine could not be invoked. It explained: Yet, in Crebello v. Ombudsman, it was underscored that the prospective application of Carpio-Morales should be reckoned from April 12, 2016 because that was the date on which this Court had acted upon and denied with finality the motion for clarification/motion for partial reconsideration thereon. Verily, we hold that petitioner can no longer avail of the condonation doctrine because although the complaint below was instituted on January 9, 2015, he got reelected only on May 9, 2016, well within the prospective application of Carpio-Morales.[66] (Citation omitted) Nonetheless, that is not the case here. Although the administrative complaint was filed against respondent after the 2010 elections, it would not change the fact that the alleged act was committed in 2009, and the electorate reelected him in 2010, the immediately succeeding election. In Salumbides, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman:[67] Salalima v. Guingona, Jr. and Mayor Garcia v. Hon. Mojica reinforced the doctrine. The condonation rule was applied even if the administrative complaint was not filed before the reelection of the public official, and even if the alleged misconduct occurred four days before the elections, respectively. Salalima did not distinguish as to the date of filing of the administrative complaint, as long as the alleged misconduct was committed during the prior term, the precise timing or period of which Garcia did not further distinguish, as long as the wrongdoing that gave rise to the public official's culpability was committed prior to the date of reelection.[68] (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) This Court also takes the opportunity to clarify the effect of Carpio Morales. In Crebello, we upheld the Office of the Ombudsman's argument that since the abandonment became effective only on April 12, 2016, \"it would no longer apply the defense of condonation starting on April 12, 2016 except for open and pending administrative cases.\"[69] Thus, after Carpio Morales became final, the condonation doctrine's applicability now depends on the date of the filing of the complaint, not the date of the commission of the offense.[70] Had the case been filed against respondent on April 13, 2016, for instance, he could no longer rely on the condonation doctrine. However, since the case was filed in January 2016, and was admitted in February 2016, it was already an open case by the time the condonation doctrine was abandoned. On the second and third issues, a review of the Petition filed before the Court of Appeals shows that respondent only raised the issue of whether the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when it granted the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint Generally, courts are limited to the issues raised by the parties before it. However, since respondent invoked the condonation doctrine, and we have ruled that he can invoke the doctrine, the Court of Appeals did not err in so ruling: For this reason alone, We find no justification to sustain the continuation of the administrative proceedings against Malapitan as he could no longer be held administratively liable for the act upon which he was administratively charged. The administrative case serves no other purpose than to expose him unnecessarily to the rigors of a full-blown investigation and hearing when, in the end, he would not be held accountable for a misconduct he committed during his prior term of public office. Indeed, it is an exercise in futility to still implead him in the administrative complaint.[71] As to respondent's argument that there was a substantial period before the administrative complaint was filed against him, this Court has ruled that: . . . well-entrenched is the rule that administrative offenses do not prescribe. Administrative offenses by their very nature pertain to the character of public officers and employees. In disciplining public officers and employees, the object sought is not the punishment of the officer or employee but the improvement of the public service and the preservation of the public's faith and confidence in our government.[72] (Citations omitted) At the time the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition was filed before the Court of Appeals,[73] the condonation doctrine has been abandoned. Nevertheless, since respondent can invoke the condonation doctrine, the Court of Appeals did not encroach on the Office of the Ombudsman's powers when it enjoined the Office of the Ombudsman from proceeding with the administrative complaint against respondent. Carpio Morales, citing Garcia v. Mojica,[74] recognized the futility of continuing with an administrative complaint when, in the end, the erring official could be exculpated by the condonation doctrine: [I]f it was established that the acts subject of the administrative complaint were indeed committed during Binay, Jr.'s prior term, then, following the condonation doctrine, he can no longer be administratively charged. In other words, with condonation having been invoked by Binay, Jr. as an exculpatory affirmative defense at the onset, the CA deemed it unnecessary to determine if the evidence of guilt against him was strong, at least for the purpose of issuing the subject injunctive writs.[75] For administrative cases filed after April 12, 2016, the date when the condonation doctrine was abandoned, the rule is that courts should refrain from interfering with investigations conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, being an independent body authorized by no less than our Constitution[76] and Republic Act No. 6770[77] to handle complaints against public officials and civil servants.[78] Carpio Morales espoused: However, despite the ostensible breach of the separation of powers principle, the Court is not oblivious to the policy considerations behind the first paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770, as well as other statutory provisions of similar import. Thus, pending deliberation on whether or not to adopt the same, the Court, under its sole prerogative and authority over all matters of procedure, deems it proper to declare as ineffective the prohibition against courts other than the Supreme Court from issuing provisional injunctive writs to enjoin investigations conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, until it is adopted as part of the rules of procedure through an administrative circular duly issued therefor.[79] For clarity, respondent is absolved only of administrative liability based on the condonation doctrine. This Court makes no pronouncement on the criminal complaint against him. WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' August 31, 2016 Decision and January 31, 2017 Resolution in CA-G.R.

[9] (Emphasis in the original) The criminal complaint arose from the allegedly anomalous use of \nMalapitan's Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) worth \nP8,000,000.00. Malapitan, then a district representative, and the other \ncharged officials had approved the PDAF to fund the programs of Kalookan\n Assistance Council, Inc. in 2009. [10]\n\nThe criminal complaint also contained an administrative charge for grave\n misconduct, gross neglect of duty, and conduct prejudicial to the best \ninterest of service against Mateo G. Montafto, Pacita D. Sarino, and \nVilma G. Cabrera, three of the charged officials. Malapitan was not \nimpleaded in the administrative complaint. [11]\n\nOn January 22, 2016, the Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office filed a Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint, [12] asking that Malapitan be impleaded in the administrative complaint after he had been inadvertently left out as a respondent. [13] On February 22, 2016, [14] the Office of the Ombudsman's Task Force PDAF granted the motion.\n\nMalapitan moved for reconsideration [15] of this Order, but the Task Force PDAF denied his motion. [16] This denial prompted Malapitan to file a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition [17] before the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn August 31, 2016, the Court of Appeals granted [18] the Petition. It revisited the history of the condonation doctrine in jurisprudence [19] until it was abandoned in Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals [20] on November 10, 2015. [21] The Court of Appeals pointed out that such abandonment applied prospectively. [22] It then ruled that since Malapitan's alleged misconduct was committed in 2009, the condonation doctrine applied to his case. [23]\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that under the condonation doctrine, \nMalapitan's election as mayor right after his term as Caloocan \nrepresentative was a form of condonation from the voting public:\nAlso relevant to stress is that the same act subject of the \nadministrative complaint was contracted by Malapitan as the \nrepresentative of the 1 st District of Caloocan City at the \nHouse of Representative[s]. However, when he was elected as the Mayor of\n the City of Caloocan in the 2013 elections, whatever wrongful act or \nmisconduct, if any, committed by him during his previous term as \nCongressman that might give rise to an administrative liability, was \nimpliedly remitted and disregarded by the electoral process following \nthe condonation doctrine set forth in our jurisprudence. For this reason\n alone, We find no justification to sustain the continuation of the \nadministrative proceedings against Malapitan as he could no longer be \nheld administratively liable for the act upon which he was \nadministratively charged. The administrative case serves no other \npurpose than to expose him unnecessarily to the rigors of a full-blown \ninvestigation and hearing when, in the end, he would not be held \naccountable for a misconduct he committed during his prior term of \npublic office. Indeed, it is an exercise in futility to still implead \nhim in the administrative complaint. [24] The Court of Appeals also chided the Office of the Ombudsman for its \n\"flimsy excuse\" of inadvertently failing to implead Malapitan in the \nadministrative complaint. [25] It declared that the belated amendment to implead Malapitan was clearly brought about by the Carpio Morales ruling, with the Office of the Ombudsman mistakenly believing that \nthere was no longer any legal hindrance to include Malapitan. [26]\n\nThe dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads:\nFOR THESE REASONS , We GRANT the instant Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition . The Orders dated 22 February 2016 and 18 March 2016 of the Task Force PDAF of the Office of the Ombudsman are NULLIFIED and the latter is enjoined from proceeding with the administrative case\n docketed as OMB-C-A-15-0042 as against Oscar G. Malapitan.\n\nSO ORDERED. [27] (Emphasis in the original) In its January 31, 2017 Resolution, [28] the Court of Appeals dismissed the Office of the Ombudsman's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nIn this Petition for Review on Certiorari, [29] petitioners Office of the Ombudsman, Task Force PDAF, and the Public \nAssistance and Corruption Prevention Office allege that the Court of \nAppeals encroached on the Office of the Ombudsman's administrative \ndisciplinary authority when it nullified the Orders of Task Force PDAF. \nPetitioners further claim that the proper remedy was for respondent \nMalapitan to file a counter-affidavit before the Task Force PDAF and not\n the extraordinary remedies of certiorari and prohibition before the \nCourt of Appeals. [30]\n\nPetitioners assert that respondent filed his Counter-Affidavit two \nmonths before he filed his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition \nbefore the Court of Appeals, thus mooting the latter. Furthermore, they \npoint out that since respondent actively participated in the \nadministrative proceedings before filing his Petition for Certiorari and\n Prohibition, he had already submitted himself to the Office of the \nOmbudsman's jurisdiction. [31]\n\nPetitioners likewise submit that since the Task Force PDAF's Orders were\n merely interlocutory, the Court of Appeals prematurely resolved the \nadministrative case against respondent on the merits by relying on the \ncondonation doctrine. [32] Nonetheless, petitioners posit that even if the Court of Appeals could \nrightfully rule on the merits of the administrative case, the \ncondonation doctrine does not apply to respondent because it was \nabandoned in Carpio Morales , and should no longer apply to cases still pending with the Office of the Ombudsman. [33]\n\nPetitioners further maintain that even if Carpio Morales did not \nabandon the condonation doctrine, it still would not apply to respondent\n because he committed the alleged act in 2009, when he was a \nrepresentative, while the complaint was only filed when he was already a\n mayor, \"a position different from the position he held at the time he \ncommitted the acts of complained of.\" [34]\n\nIn his Comment, [35] respondent cited cases [36] where it was held that courts can review \"the Office of the Ombudsman's\n exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers\" when there is \ngrave abuse of discretion. [37]\n\nRespondent then argues that he could not be impleaded \"because his acts \nwere considered condoned by the electorate upon his re-election.\" [38] He maintains that the condonation doctrine's abandonment is applied prospectively. [39] He also insists that petitioners only sought the amendment to implead him because they had mistakenly thought that Carpio Morales , issued in November 2015, would now work against him in the administrative case originally filed in February 2015. [40]\n\nRespondent further argues that his Petition before the Court of Appeals \nwas not rendered moot when he filed his Counter-Affidavit and Verified \nPosition Paper. [41] He said that he \"reserved his right to question\" [42] his inclusion in the administrative case when he filed his Verified Position Paper Ad Cautelam . [43]\n\nIn addition, respondent argues that the administrative complaint has prescribed. [44] Citing Section 20(5) of Republic Act No. 6770, or the Ombudsman Act of \n1989, respondent argues that the Office of the Ombudsman may not \ninvestigate any complaint filed more than one year after the act \ncomplained of had been committed. From this, he points out that the \nadministrative charges have prescribed because the acts imputed to him \nwere committed in 2009, while the complaint was filed only in 2016. [45]\n\nRespondent also cites Section 20(2), in relation to Section 21, of \nRepublic Act No. 6770 and notes that when he committed the alleged acts \nin 2009, he was still a member of Congress, and thus, outside the Office\n of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. [46] He then notes that the Commission on Audit has primary jurisdiction \nover him because the charges involve the use of his PDAF when he was \nstill a district representative. [47]\n\nFinally, respondent says that petitioner's late filing of the \nadministrative complaint violates his right to due process and to the \nspeedy disposition of cases. [48]\n\nIn their Reply, [49] petitioners counter that the filing of an amended complaint is allowed \nunder Administrative Order No. 7 and the Rules of Court. In addition, \nthey point out that respondent filed no responsive pleading when they \nmoved to amend their complaint. [50]\n\nPetitioners also maintain that respondent's active participation in the proceedings and filing of several pleadings [51] mooted his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition where he questioned the filing of the amended Complaint. [52]\n\nAs for respondent's invocation of Section 21 of the Ombudsman Act, \npetitioners rebut that this is \"not a permanent exception or exclusion\"; [53] otherwise, \"there would be no means to fully account for the official's administrative liability.\" [54] Petitioners claim that illegal acts may only be discovered after a public official's term of office. [55]\n\nFurther, petitioners interpret Section 20(5) of Republic Act No. 6770 \ndifferently in that it \"does not refer to the prescription of the \noffense but to the discretion granted to the Office of the Ombudsman on \nwhether it would investigate a particular administrative offense.\" [56]\n\nPetitioners also say that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not \napply because the Commission on Audit's investigation is different from \nthe Office of the Ombudsman's investigation. [57]\n\nFinally, petitioners deny that respondent's rights to due process and to the speedy disposition of cases have been violated. [58] He was allegedly given the chance to respond to the allegations against him. [59] They add that respondent himself contributed to the delay he complains \nof \"by his filing of motions for extension of time and other dilatory \nand prohibited pleadings before the Office of the Ombudsman and the \n[Court of Appeals].\" [60]\n\nThe issues for this Court's resolution are:\n\nFirst, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the \ncondonation doctrine is applicable to respondent Oscar Gonzales \nMalapitan;\n\nSecond, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling on \nrespondent's administrative liability, considering that the issue raised\n before it was whether the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its \ndiscretion in granting the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint; \nand\n\nFinally, whether or not the Court of Appeals encroached on the powers of\n the Office of the Ombudsman when it enjoined the Office of the \nOmbudsman from proceeding with the administrative case against \nrespondent Oscar Gonzales Malapitan.\n\nThe Petition is denied.\n\nThe Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the condonation \ndoctrine applies to respondent Since the act constituting the \nadministrative offense was allegedly committed in 2009, and he was \nreelected in 2010, the condonation doctrine would still apply.\n\nThere appears to be confusion as to when the abandonment of the condonation doctrine took effect Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals [61] was rendered on November 10, 2015. After this, on January 22, 2016, the\n administrative complaint was amended to include respondent, as the \ncondonation doctrine was supposedly no longer available to him.\n\nThis confusion has long been put to rest in Crebello v. Office of the Ombudsman , [62] where this Court declared the exact date of the abandonment:\nThe abandonment of the doctrine of condonation took effect \non April 12, 2016, when the Supreme Court denied with finality the OMB's\n Motion for Reconsideration in Morales v. Court of Appeals . [63] (Citation omitted) Here, the amended administrative complaint was admitted on February 22, \n2016; hence, the condonation doctrine was not yet abandoned. The alleged\n acts imputed to respondent were supposedly committed in 2009. He was \nreelected as member of the House of Representatives in 2010. [64] This immediately succeeding victory is what the condonation doctrine \nlooks at. That respondent was later reelected in 2013, 2016, and 2019 \nwould be irrelevant.\n\nIn Herrera v. Mago , [65] where the public official was reelected in May 2016, after the \nabandonment of the condonation doctrine had taken effect, this Court \nruled that the doctrine could not be invoked. It explained:\nYet, in Crebello v. Ombudsman , it was underscored \nthat the prospective application of Carpio-Morales should be reckoned \nfrom April 12, 2016 because that was the date on which this Court had \nacted upon and denied with finality the motion for clarification/motion \nfor partial reconsideration thereon.\n\nVerily, we hold that petitioner can no longer avail of the condonation \ndoctrine because although the complaint below was instituted on January \n9, 2015, he got reelected only on May 9, 2016, well within the \nprospective application of Carpio-Morales . [66] (Citation omitted) Nonetheless, that is not the case here. Although the administrative \ncomplaint was filed against respondent after the 2010 elections, it \nwould not change the fact that the alleged act was committed in 2009, \nand the electorate reelected him in 2010, the immediately succeeding \nelection. In Salumbides, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman : [67]\nSalalima v. Guingona, Jr. and Mayor Garcia v. Hon. Mojica reinforced the doctrine. The condonation rule was applied even if the administrative complaint was not\n filed before the reelection of the public official, and even if the \nalleged misconduct occurred four days before the elections , respectively. Salalima did not distinguish as to the date of filing of the administrative \ncomplaint, as long as the alleged misconduct was committed during the \nprior term, the precise timing or period of which Garcia did not \nfurther distinguish, as long as the wrongdoing that gave rise to the \npublic official's culpability was committed prior to the date of \nreelection. [68] (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) This Court also takes the opportunity to clarify the effect of Carpio Morales . In Crebello ,\n we upheld the Office of the Ombudsman's argument that since the \nabandonment became effective only on April 12, 2016, \"it would no longer\n apply the defense of condonation starting on April 12, 2016 except for open and pending administrative cases .\" [69] Thus, after Carpio Morales became final, the condonation doctrine's applicability now depends on the date of the filing of the complaint , not the date of the commission of the offense. [70] Had the case been filed against respondent on April 13, 2016, for \ninstance, he could no longer rely on the condonation doctrine.\n\nHowever, since the case was filed in January 2016, and was admitted in February 2016, it was already an open case by the time the condonation doctrine was abandoned .\n\nOn the second and third issues, a review of the Petition filed before \nthe Court of Appeals shows that respondent only raised the issue of \nwhether the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when \nit granted the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint Generally, \ncourts are limited to the issues raised by the parties before it. \nHowever, since respondent invoked the condonation doctrine, and we have \nruled that he can invoke the doctrine, the Court of Appeals did not err \nin so ruling:\nFor this reason alone, We find no justification to sustain \nthe continuation of the administrative proceedings against Malapitan as \nhe could no longer be held administratively liable for the act upon \nwhich he was administratively charged. The administrative case serves no\n other purpose than to expose him unnecessarily to the rigors of a \nfull-blown investigation and hearing when, in the end, he would not be \nheld accountable for a misconduct he committed during his prior term of \npublic office. Indeed, it is an exercise in futility to still implead \nhim in the administrative complaint. [71] As to respondent's argument that there was a substantial period before \nthe administrative complaint was filed against him, this Court has ruled\n that:\n. . . well-entrenched is the rule that administrative \noffenses do not prescribe. Administrative offenses by their very nature \npertain to the character of public officers and employees. In \ndisciplining public officers and employees, the object sought is not the\n punishment of the officer or employee but the improvement of the public\n service and the preservation of the public's faith and confidence in \nour government. [72] (Citations omitted) At the time the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition was filed before the Court of Appeals, [73] the condonation doctrine has been abandoned. Nevertheless, since \nrespondent can invoke the condonation doctrine, the Court of Appeals did\n not encroach on the Office of the Ombudsman's powers when it enjoined \nthe Office of the Ombudsman from proceeding with the administrative \ncomplaint against respondent.\n\nCarpio Morales , citing Garcia v. Mojica , [74] recognized the futility of continuing with an administrative complaint \nwhen, in the end, the erring official could be exculpated by the \ncondonation doctrine:\n[I]f it was established that the acts subject of the \nadministrative complaint were indeed committed during Binay, Jr.'s prior\n term, then, following the condonation doctrine, he can no longer be \nadministratively charged. In other words, with condonation having been \ninvoked by Binay, Jr. as an exculpatory affirmative defense at the \nonset, the CA deemed it unnecessary to determine if the evidence of \nguilt against him was strong, at least for the purpose of issuing the \nsubject injunctive writs. [75] For administrative cases filed after April 12, 2016, the date when the \ncondonation doctrine was abandoned, the rule is that courts should \nrefrain from interfering with investigations conducted by the Office of \nthe Ombudsman, being an independent body authorized by no less than our \nConstitution [76] and Republic Act No. 6770 [77] to handle complaints against public officials and civil servants. [78] Carpio Morales espoused:\nHowever, despite the ostensible breach of the separation of \npowers principle, the Court is not oblivious to the policy \nconsiderations behind the first paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770, as \nwell as other statutory provisions of similar import. Thus, pending \ndeliberation on whether or not to adopt the same, the Court, under its \nsole prerogative and authority over all matters of procedure, deems it \nproper to declare as ineffective the prohibition against courts other \nthan the Supreme Court from issuing provisional injunctive writs to \nenjoin investigations conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, until it\n is adopted as part of the rules of procedure through an administrative \ncircular duly issued therefor. [79] For clarity, respondent is absolved only of administrative liability \nbased on the condonation doctrine. This Court makes no pronouncement on \nthe criminal complaint against him.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Petition is DENIED .
