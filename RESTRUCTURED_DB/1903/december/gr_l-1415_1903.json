No. L-1415\tDecember 2, 1903\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\ncomplainant-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nANASTASIO MANGUBAT ET AL.,\n\ndefendants-appellants.\n\nMariano Fermin for appellants.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.\n\nJOHNSON,\n\nJ.:\n\nThe defendants were charged with \"\n\nrobo en cuadrilla or bandolerismo\n\n\" as follows:\n\nThat the said accused, on the 9th of December, 1902, in San Pablo, of the Province of Laguna, conspired together and formed a band of ladrones and robbed various persons by means of force and violence, in an uninhabited place, and went upon the highways armed with deadly weapons.\n\nOn the 10th of July, 1903, the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Laguna found the accused guilty of the crime of\n\nbandolerismo\n\nand sentenced each of them to be imprisoned for a period of twenty years, to indemnify the persons robbed, and to pay the costs.\n\nlawphil.net\n\nThe defendants demurred to the complaint filed in the said cause, alleging that it contained allegations of two distinct causes. The trial judge overruled the demurrer. The court held that the complaint contained but one cause, and that the allegation\n\nrobo en cuadrilla or bandolerismo\n\nsimply set out the same fact in different aspects. There was no error in overruling the demurrer.\n\nThe proof taken in the trial of the said accused showed conclusively that they had joined in robbing, with violence, Aurelio Rivero, Alejo Punto, and Gregorio Ilao, of personal property belonging to them of the value of 13, 6, and 4 pesos, respectively. There was much conflict in the evidence relating to the question whether the accused were armed, as charged in the complaint.\n\nThis proof was not sufficient to convict the said accused of\n\nbandolerismo\n\nunder Act No. 518 of the Philippine Commission because it was not shown that the said accused were armed. It\n\nwas\n\nsufficient to convict them of the crime of robbery. The said accused are therefore hereby found to be guilty of the crime of robbery with force and intimidation. The offense proven is punished under sub-section 5 of article 503 of the Penal Code.\n\nThere were neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstances proven. Therefore the medium degree of the penalty provided should be imposed. By applying the rule laid down in article 82 of the said code, the medium degree is found to be six years and ten months of\n\nprision mayor\n\n.\n\nThe sentence of the court below is hereby modified, and the said accused Anastasio Mangubat, Antonio Bondad, Prudencio Celino, and Esteban Guevara, and each of them, are hereby sentenced to six years and ten months of\n\nprision mayor\n\n, to indemnify the said persons robbed in the sum of $23, Mexican, and to pay all costs.\n\nArellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and McDonough, JJ., concur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
