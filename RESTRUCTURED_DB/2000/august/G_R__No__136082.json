Nos. 108135-36, August 14, 2000 ]\n\nPOTENCIANA M. EVANGELISTA, PETITIONER, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, (FIRST DIVISION), RESPONDENTS.R E S O L U T I O N\nPOTENCIANA M. EVANGELISTA, PETITIONER, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, (FIRST DIVISION), RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nOn September 30, 1999, we rendered a Decision in this case \nacquitting petitioner of the charge of violation of then Section 268 (4)\n of the National Internal Revenue Code [1] but affirming her conviction for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3 (e), [2] thus imposing on her an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for six \n(6) years and one month as minimum to twelve (12) years as maximum, and \nthe penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office.\n\nThe basic facts are briefly restated as follows:\n\nOn September 17, 1987, Tanduay Distillery, Inc. filed with the \nBureau of Internal Revenue an application for tax credit in the amount \nof P180,701,682.00, for allegedly erroneous payments of ad valorem taxes\n from January 1, 1986 to August 31, 1987. Tanduay claimed that it is a \nrectifier of alcohol and other spirits, which per previous ruling of the\n BIR is only liable to pay specific taxes and not ad valorem taxes. Upon\n receipt of the application, Aquilino Larin of the Specific Tax Office \nsent a memorandum to the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD), headed by \npetitioner, requesting the said office to check and verify whether the \namounts claimed by Tanduay were actually paid to the BIR as ad valorem \ntaxes. Larinâs memorandum was received by the Revenue Administrative \nSection (RAS), a subordinate office of the RAD. After making the \nnecessary verification, the RAS prepared a certification in the form of a\n 1st Indorsement to the Specific Tax Office, dated September 25, 1987, \nwhich was signed by petitioner as RAD chief.\n\nThe 1st Indorsement states that Tanduay made tax payments \nclassified under Tax Numeric Code (TNC) 3011-0001 totalling \nP102,519,100.00 and payments classified under TNC 0000-0000 totalling \nP78,182,582.00. Meanwhile, Teodoro PareÃ±o, head of the Tax and Alcohol \nDivision, certified to Justino Galban, Jr., Head of the Compounders, \nRectifiers and Repackers Section, that Tanduay was a rectifier not \nliable for ad valorem tax. PareÃ±o recommended to Larin that the \napplication for tax credit be given due course. Hence, Larin recommended\n that Tanduayâs claim be approved, on the basis of which Deputy \nCommissioner Eufracio D. Santos signed Tax Credit Memo No. 5177 in the \namount of P180,701,682.00.\n\nSometime thereafter, a certain Ruperto Lim wrote a \nletter-complaint to then BIR Commissioner Bienvenido Tan, Jr. alleging \nthat the grant of Tax Credit Memo No. 5177 was irregular and anomalous. \nBased on this, Larin, PareÃ±o, Galban and petitioner Evangelista were \ncharged before the Sandiganbayan with violation of Section 268 (4) of \nthe National Internal Revenue Code and of Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019, \nthe Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Larin, PareÃ±o and petitioner \nwere later convicted of both crimes, while Galban was acquitted inasmuch\n as his only participation in the processing of Tanduayâs application \nwas the preparation of the memorandum confirming that Tanduay was a \nrectifier.\n\nThe three accused filed separate petitions for review. PareÃ±oâs \nand Larinâs petitions were consolidated and, in a decision dated April \n17, 1996, both were acquitted by this Court in Criminal Cases Nos. 14208\n and 14209. [3] In this \npetition, on the other hand, we acquitted petitioner in Criminal Case \nNo. 14208, for violation of Section 268 (4) of the NIRC. However, we \nfound petitioner guilty of gross negligence in issuing a certification \ncontaining TNCs which she did not know the meaning of and which, in \nturn, became the basis of the Bureauâs grant of Tanduayâs application \nfor tax credit. Thus, we affirmed petitionerâs conviction in Criminal \nCase No. 14209, i.e., for violation of Section 3 (e) of the Anti-Graft \nand Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nPetitioner seasonably filed a Motion for Reconsideration, [4] wherein she asserts that there was nothing false in her certification \ninasmuch as she did not endorse therein approval of the application for \ntax credit. Rather, her certification showed the contrary, namely, that \nTanduay was not entitled to the tax credit since there was no proof that\n it paid ad valorem taxes. Petitioner also claims that she was neither \nafforded due process nor informed of the nature and cause of the \naccusation against her. She was found guilty of an offense different \nfrom that alleged in the information; consequently, she was unable to \nproperly defend herself from the crime for which she was convicted.\n\nThe Information against petitioner and her co-accused in Criminal\n Case No. 14209 alleges in fine that they caused undue injury to the \nGovernment and gave unwarranted benefits to Tanduay when they endorsed \napproval of the claim for tax credit by preparing, signing and \nsubmitting false memoranda, certification and/or official communications\n stating that Tanduay paid ad valorem taxes when it was not liable for \nsuch because its products are distilled spirits on which specific taxes \nare paid, by reason of which false memoranda, certification and/or \nofficial communications the BIR approved the application for tax credit,\n thus defrauding the Government of the sum of P107,087,394.80, \nrepresenting the difference between the amount claimed as tax credit and\n the amount of ad valorem taxes paid by Tanduay to the BIR. [5] According to petitioner, instead of convicting her of the acts \ndescribed in the Information, she was convicted of issuing the \ncertification without identifying the kinds of tax for which the TNCs \nstand and without indicating whether Tanduay was really entitled to tax \ncredit or not.\n\nThe Solicitor General filed his Comment [6] wherein he joined petitionerâs cause and prayed that the motion for \nreconsideration be granted. In hindsight, even the Solicitor Generalâs \ncomment on the petition consisted of a \"Manifestation and Motion in lieu\n of Comment,\" [7] where he recommended that petitioner be acquitted of the two charges against her.\n\nWe find that the Motion for Reconsideration is well-taken.\n\nAfter a careful re-examination of the records of this case, it \nwould appear that the certification made by petitioner in her 1st \nIndorsement was not favorable to Tanduayâs application for tax credit. \nFar from it, petitionerâs certification meant that there were no \npayments of ad valorem taxes by Tanduay in the records and hence, it was\n not entitled to tax credit. In other words, the certification was \nagainst the grant of Tanduayâs application for tax credit.\n\nIt has been established that the BIR adopted tax numeric codes \n(TNCs) to classify taxes according to their kinds and rates, in order to\n facilitate the preparation of statistical and other management reports,\n the improvement of revenue accounting and the production of tax data \nessential to management planning and decision-making. These codes \ninclude TNC No. 3011-0001 for specific tax on domestic distilled \nspirits, TNC No. 3023-2001 for ad valorem tax on compounded liquors, and\n TNC No. 0000-0000 for unclassified taxes.\n\nPetitionerâs 1st Indorsement dated September 25, 1987 lists down \nthe confirmation receipts covering tax payments by Tanduay for the \nperiod January 1, 1986 to August 31, 1987, during which Tanduay alleges \nthat it made erroneous ad valorem tax payments, classified according to \nTNC numbers. The tax payments therein are described only as falling \nunder TNC No. 3011-0001, i.e., specific tax, and TNC No. 0000-0000, \ni.e., unclassified taxes. There are no tax payments classified as \nfalling under TNC No. 3023-2001, the code for ad valorem taxes. The \nimport of this, simply, is that Tanduay did not make any ad valorem tax \npayments during the said period and is, therefore, not entitled to any \ntax credit.\n\nFurther, petitioner contends that she was convicted of a supposed crime not punishable by law. [8] She was charged with violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. \n3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which states:\n\nSEC. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers . --- In \naddition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by \nexisting law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any \npublic officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:\n\nxxx xxx xx.\n\n(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the \nGovernment, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, \nadvantage or preference in the discharge of his official, judicial or \nadministrative functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith \nor gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers \nand employees of offices or government corporations charged with the \ngrant of licenses or permits or other concessions.\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\n\nThe elements of the offense are: (1) that the accused are public \nofficers or private persons charged in conspiracy with them; (2) that \nsaid public officers commit the prohibited acts during the performance \nof their official duties or in relation to their public positions; (3) \nthat they cause undue injury to any party, whether the Government or a \nprivate party; (4) that such injury is caused by giving unwarranted \nbenefits, advantage or preference to such parties; and (5) that the \npublic officers have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith \nor gross inexcusable negligence. [9]\n\nR.A. 3019, Section 3, paragraph (e), as amended, provides as one \nof its elements that the public officer should have acted by causing any\n undue injury to any party, including the Government, or by giving any \nprivate party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the \ndischarge of his functions. The use of the disjunctive term \"or\" \nconnotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3, \nparagraph (e), or as aptly held in Santiago, [10] as two (2) different modes of committing the offense. This does not \nhowever indicate that each mode constitutes a distinct offense, but \nrather, that an accused may be charged under either mode or under both. [11]\n\nIn the instant case, we find that petitioner, in issuing the \ncertification, did not cause any undue injury to the Government. She \nalso did not give unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to \nTanduay. Neither did petitioner display manifest partiality to Tanduay \nnor act with evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. Quite \nthe contrary, petitionerâs certification was against the interest of \nTanduay. It did not advocate the grant of its application for tax \ncredit. The certification can even be read as a recommendation of denial\n of the application.\n\nPetitioner further argues that her conviction was merely based on\n her alleged failure to identify with certainty in her certification the\n kinds of taxes paid by Tanduay and to indicate what the TNCs stand for,\n which acts were different from those described in the Information under\n which she was charged. This, she claims, violated her constitutional \nright to due process and to be informed of the nature and cause of the \naccusation against her.\n\nIt is well-settled that an accused cannot be convicted of an \noffense unless it is clearly charged in the complaint or information. \nConstitutionally, he has a right to be informed of the nature and cause \nof the accusation against him. To convict him of an offense other than \nthat charged in the complaint or information would be a violation of \nthis constitutional right. [12] In the case at bar, we find merit in petitionerâs contention that the \nacts for which she was convicted are different from those alleged in the\n Information. More importantly, as we have discussed above, petitionerâs\n act of issuing the certification did not constitute corrupt practices \nas defined in Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019.\n\nEmployees of the BIR were expected to know what the TNCs stand \nfor. If they do not, there is a \"Handbook of Tax Numeric Code of Revenue\n Sources\" which they can consult. With this, petitioner should not be \nrequired to describe in words the kinds of tax for which each TNC used \nstands for. Precisely, the purpose of introducing the use of tax numeric\n codes in the Bureau was to do away with these descriptive words, in \norder to expedite and facilitate communications among the different \ndivisions therein. We find that petitionerâs omission to indicate what \nkind of taxes TNC Nos. 3011-0001 and 0000-0000 stand for was not a \ncriminal act. Applicable here is the familiar maxim in criminal law: Nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege . There is no crime where there is no law punishing it.\n\nOn the whole, therefore, we find that petitioner was not guilty \nof any criminal offense. The prosecutionâs evidence failed to establish \nthat petitioner committed the acts described in the Information which \nconstitute corrupt practices. Her conviction must, therefore, be set \naside. For conviction must rest no less than on hard evidence showing \nthat the accused, with moral certainty, is guilty of the crime charged. \nShort of these constitutional mandate and statutory safeguard --- that a\n person is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved --- the Court \nis then left without discretion and is duty bound to render a judgment \nof acquittal. [13]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Motion for Reconsideration is \nGRANTED. This Courtâs Decision dated September 30, 1999 is RECONSIDERED \nand SET ASIDE. Petitioner is ACQUITTED of the charge against her.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan , and Pardo, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Criminal Case No. 14208, Sandiganbayan, First Division.\n\n[2] Criminal Case No. 14209, Sandiganbayan, First Division.\n\n[3] PareÃ±o v.
