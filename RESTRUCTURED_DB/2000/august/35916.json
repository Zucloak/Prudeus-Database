PAGALILAUAN, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPURISIMA, J.:\n\nAt bar is an administrative complaint of Mamerto T. Pacris \n(complainant) against Judge Adrian N. Pagalilauan (respondent) of Branch\n 12, Regional Trial Court, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, for serious \nmisconduct, gross ignorance of the law, inefficiency and falsification \nof monthly certificate of service.\n\nComplainant charges respondent as follows:\n\nâTHE CHARGES\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nDuring the pendency of Election Case No. 1807-S, entitled âFederico\n Q. Galapia, protestant, versus Mamerto T. Pacris, protestee,â which was\n tried and submitted for decision before respondent judge, and during \nthe campaign of (sic) the 1995 elections, wherein the protestant and the\n protestee were again among the candidates for mayor in Sanchez Mira, \nCagayan, the protestant in his campaign speeches told the public that he\n will sit as the Mayor-elect of Sanchez Mira on April 14, 1995. So the \nprotestee approached the respondent judge in his chambers to inquire \nfrom him if he has (sic) already rendered his decision in the election \nprotest involving the protestant and the protestee and stated to him \nwhat the protestant had been publicly telling the people, but respondent\n judge told protestee not to believe the protestant and to convince \nprotestee, he showed his unsigned decision dismissing Election Case No. \n1807-S.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIn the early morning of April 20, 1995, the undersigned before \ngoing to Tuguegarao, Cagayan, to see the Governor on official matters, \nhe decided to see first the respondent judge in his chambers, which he \nwas using it (sic) at that time as his sleeping quarters without the \npermission of the Supreme Court because he left his boarding house after\n he was caught peeping at the daughter of his landlady while taking a \nbath, to ascertain from him if it is (sic) true what protestant had been\n telling the public that he will (sic) sit that day, April 20, 1995, as \nthe mayor-elect of Sanchez Mira and he admitted that he had changed his \nunsigned decision dismissing the election protest and invalidated the \nballots with undetached coupons.\n\nWhen protestee arrived home from Tuguegarao in the afternoon, he \nwas informed that the respondent judge had promulgated his decision \n(Annex âAâ) in the election protest and the Comelec Officer of Sanchez \nMira had already received his copy of the decision from whom protestee \ngot an immediate xerox copy as the basis of his perfection of an appeal \nwith the COMELEC on April 22, 1995.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThat respondent judge, as part of his plan, design or scheme to \nmake protestant win the election protest, intentionally violated the \nCOMELEC Rules of Procedure in his desire to favor the protestant, by not\n setting a date for the promulgation of the decision wherein due notice \nmust be given to the parties, but instead he immediately promulgated the\n same on the very day it was rendered, in violation of Rule 35, Sec. 19 \nof the COMELEC Rules of Procedure and the case of Alejo vs. Tanada, 238 \nSCRA 60 (1994).\n\nThat respondent judge, intentionally and persistent-disregarded \n(sic) well-known law, legal rules and jurisprudence or stare decisis to \nthe prejudice of the protestee and knowing it as the only possible means\n to make protestant win his election protest, declared invalid one \nhundred twenty one (121) ballots with undetached upper coupons cast in \nfavor of protestee in violation of Sec. 211 of the Omnibus Election \nCode, which provides:\n\nâ27. Failure to remove the detachable coupon from a ballot does not annul such ballot.â\n\nand the settled doctrine that voters shall not be deprived by \n(sic) their votes by mere failure of the election officer to comply with\n the formal prerequisites of voting (Valenzuela vs. Carlos, 42 Phil. \n428).\n\nTo justify his illegal, unlawful and fraudulent act in declaring \ninvalid 121 ballots with undetached upper coupons, respondent judge \nopined:\n\nâxxx the protestee cit(ed) the case of Valenzuela vs. Carlos, \n42 Phil. 428. The Court agrees with this, for it is but fair and \nreasonable in so far as simple, innocent and honest ommission (sic) of \nelection officers are concerned. The court however doubts whether the \nrules should cover all kinds of ommission (sic) by election officers be \nit deliberate or not and irrespective of whether or not the ommission \n(sic) defeats the secrecy of the voterâs vote. xxx.â\n\ncontrary to the Supreme Court ruling in Albert vs. Court of First Instance of Manila (Br. VI), 23 SCRA 948, which states:\n\nâSo it is, that in Martiniano P. Vivo vs. Hon. Gaudencio \nCloribel, et al., L-23239, November 23, 1966 (18 Supreme Court Reports \nAnno. 713,726), this Court stressed the need for trial judges to take cognizance of the rulings of the Supreme Court . xxxâ (Underscoring supplied)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nand Circular No. 13, dated July 1, 1987, of the Supreme Court, \nproviding general guidelines for all members of the judiciary, that \njudges should keep abreast of the rulings and doctrines laid down by the\n Supreme Court and apply them to appropriate cases regardless of their \npersonal opinion.\n\nThat respondent judge, to buttress his decision making protestant\n win in the election protest, which exposes his complete ignorance of \nthe law, not only invalidated the 121 ballots with undetached upper \ncoupons but also considered said ballots as marked contrary to the \nsettled doctrines in elections (sic) contest that the mark which shall \ninvalidate the ballot are those which the voter himself deliberately \nplaced on his ballot for the purpose of identifying it thereafter. In \nother words, a markplaced (sic) on the ballot by a person other than the\n voter himself does not invalidate [the ballot] as marked (Tajanlangit \nvs. Cazenas, G.R. No. L-18894, June 30, 1962, 5 SCRA 567). Hence, the \nballots which (sic) upper coupons were not detached by the Chairman of \nthe Board of Inspectors are not marked ballots.\n\nThat respondent judge, either as a part of his plan, design or \nscheme to make protestee lose in the election protest or in evident bad \nfaith and/or partiality, also declared invalid six (6) ballots cast in \nfavor of the protestee which were not signed by the Chairman of the \nBoard of Inspectors. However, he did not declare invalid the twenty \nfive (25) ballots cast in favor of the respondent. In the case of \nLucero vs. De Guzman, 45 Phil. 852, 875, the Court held that âxxx It is\n a well settled rule that a voter shall not be deprived of the franchise\n by mere failure of the election officials to comply with some \nprovisions or another statute relative to the acts to be done \nexclusively by the officerâ.\n\nThe respondent judge, not supported by evidence or with conscious\n and deliberate act to do an injustice against the protestee, stated in \nhis decision that, âafter a careful scrutiny of the Book of Voters and \nList of Voters, the Court findsâ, among others, the following three (3) \nof the eight voters to be invalid:\n\nâPrecinct No. 23\n\nâ1. Acdal, Orlino P voted, but at the back of his voters affidavit it is marked âdeceasedâ;\n\nâ2. Cabulisan, Pacito (policeman) voted but according to information he had been dead before the election.â\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nâPrecinct No. 22-B\n\nâ1. Alegado Nancita - voted but no name in Book of Voters.â\n\nOrlino P. Acdal died on December 12, 1992 (Annexes B-B1, while \nPacito Cabulisan died on June 2, 1992 (Annex C) after the elections on \nMay 11, 1992. The annotations âdeceasedâ at the back of their voters \naffidavit were entered by the Comelec Officer when he requested the \ncourt during the trial of the election protest for the return to his \nOffice the Book of Voters of the aforesaid precincts preparatory to the \nMay 8, 1995 elections.\n\nNancita Alegado is a classroom teacher in Barangay Tokitoc, \nSanchez Mira, Cagayan and is a registered voter of Precinct 35 therein \n(Annex D). She was assigned and served as a member of the Board of \nInspectors of Precinct 22-B of Barangay Masisit and she voted in said \nprecinct pursuant to Sec. 169 of the Omnibus Election Code allowing \nmembers of the board of election inspectors to vote in the polling place\n where they are assigned on election day.\n\nThat respondent judge, to further fortify his plan, design or \nscheme to make protestee lose the election protest and with deliberate \nintent to cause injustice on the part of the protestee and a clear \nviolation of Sec. 14, Art. VIII, 1987 Constitution, dismissed for lack \nof merit protesteeâs counter-protest without taking into account the \nfacts and evidence alleged in his counter-protest and without expressing\n therein clearly and distinctly the facts and law on which the dismissal\n was based.\n\nConsidering the facts that protestant had been publicly telling \nthe people that he has plenty of money; that he will do everything \nwithin his resources to win his election protest; that he will sit as \nthe mayor-elect of Sanchez Mira on April 20, 1995, the date of the \nquestioned decision of respondent judge; that respondent judge had \nprepared an unsigned decision dismissing the election protest; that he \nwas enticed to prepare another decision dated April 20, 1995, which he \npromulgated on the same day, declaring protestant as the winner in the \nMay 11, 1992 elections for mayor of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, in complete \ndisregard to (sic) the decisions and rules and regulation of the Supreme\n Court, the principle of res ipsa liquitor (sic) be applied to him. \n(People vs. Valenzuela, 135 SCRA 712).\n\nThat respondent judge, since appointment to the judiciary, as \npresiding judge of the Regional Trial [Court], Second Judicial Region, \nBranch 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, up to the present, has not been \nreporting for duty and hearing cases every Mondays, Thursday afternoons \nand Fridays of the week. He arrives in his station from Tuguegarao, \nCagayan, where he resides, in the morning of Tuesday and leaves his \nstation after lunch of Thursday, thereby affecting his integrity and \nefficiency.\n\nThat respondent judge, despite the fact that he does not report \nfor duty and hold session on Mondays, Thursday afternoons and Fridays, \nhe certified in his Monthly Certificate of Service that he rendered \ncomplete service for the month, which is a clear case of falsification \nof monthly certificate of service since he became a judge up to the \npresent.â [1]\n\nIn compliance with the First Indorsement [2] dated July 9, 1997 of Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo, respondent submitted his Comment [3] stating, among others:\n\nâ3. That from the time I assumed office as the presiding judge of \nthe Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan I became \naware, for the first time, of the existence and pendency of Election \nCase No. 1807-S before the said Court when it was included in the July \n29, 1993, calendar of the Court, at which time the committee on revision\n of ballots and recounting of votes had not yet submitted its report of \nthe result of the revision and recounting of votes in the precincts \ncovered by the protest and counter-protest xxx.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n10. That thereafter several incidents were submitted by the \nparties for resolution by the Court and after hearing, resolving all the\n incidents, the Court issued an order dated February 21, 1995, a copy of\n which is hereto attached as ANNEX â15â giving the parties twenty (20) \ndays within which to submit their respective memorandum and on March 13,\n 1995, the protestee submitted his memorandum personally signed by him;\n\n11. That on April 20, 1995, the undersigned, as presiding judge of \nthe court, rendered a decision on the merits. All the foregoing facts \nand incidents aptly demonstrate that I was not really inefficient in \ndisposing of Election Case No. 1807-S wherein retired Judge Mariano T. \nPacris is the protestee and counter-protestant. Much of the delay is \nattributable to the protestee and counter-protestant himself and his \ncounsel.\n\n12. That as regards the alleged delay in the elevation of the \nrecord of the case as pointed in the Comelec resolution cited in the \nletter-complaint, such delay, if there was any, was entirely called for \nand fully justified by the events and incidents which took place in \nconnection with the case after the promulgation and filing of the notice\n of appeal by the protestee, such as:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nConsequently, it is most respectfully submitted that the delay if \nthere is any, in the elevation of the record of the case to the Comelec \ncalled for and fully justified by the incidents and events that took \nplace after the promulgation of the decision and the filing of a notice \nof appeal by the protestee;\n\n13. That in so far as the alleged campaign speeches of the \nprotestant, Federico Q. Galapia, during the campaign period immediately \npreceding the May 12, 1995 local elections, stating, among others, that \nhe would sit as Mayor elect of Sanchez Mira on April 14, 1995 and/or on \nApril 20, 1995 I have absolutely nothing to do with the same, the truth \nof the matter being that I never had any occasion to talk to him or any \nof his two counsels, Attys. Victoriano G. Pascua and Abuan regarding the\n case; hence the reason why I told the protestee, Mamerto T. Pacris, \nwhen he approached me for the first time asking me if I had already \nrendered my decision in the case and on the occasion of which I told him\n I have not yet finished making the decision in the case, which was then\n absolutely true, the truth of the matter being that I was still in the \nprocess of writing the draft of the decision. Hence, contrary to the \nimputation contained in the letter-complaint, I never showed him any \ndecision, unsigned or otherwise, in the case, much less dismissing the \nelection case;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n15. That it is true that in the morning of April 20, 1995, the day I\n signed the decision in the case, the protestee approached me for the \nsecond time, again inquiring if I had already finished the decision in \nthe case and I told him the decision was already finished which prompted\n me to release the decision that very same day by handing the same to \nthe Clerk of Court who then, right away, mailed copies of the same to \nthe parties concerned, but I never told or admitted to the protestee \nthat I changed the decision dismissing the election protest the truth of\n the matter being that I never made or prepared a decision, unsigned or \notherwise, dismissing the election protest;\n\n16. That the release and consequent promulgation of the decision on\n April 20, 1995 without the date of the promulgation having been set and\n the parties notified thereof caused no damage or prejudice to any of \nthe rights of the parties in the case, the evident purpose of the \nprovisions of Sec. 20, Rule 35, Part VI of the Comelec Rules of \nProcedure, providing for the setting of the promulgation of decisions \nrendered by the Regional Trial Courts in elections cases being only to \navoid any squable (sic) between the parties litigants, in case of an \nappeal, as to whether or not the appeal was perfected within the period \nof appeal, a question which sometimes arises on account of the \ndifficulty of establishing or knowing at what time or on what date the \nparty litigants received their respective copy of the decision or order \nappealed from, as well as to achieve auniform (sic) time or date from \nwhich to perfect the period of appeal for both the protestant and the \nprotestee in such cases;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n18. That in so far as the 122 ballots in Precinct No. 23 Masisit, \nwhich were declared invalid in the decision rendered, I was fully aware \nof the provisions of Sec. 211, par. No. 27 of the Omnibus Election Code \nand of the doctrines or ruling made by the Honorable Supreme Court to \nthe effect that the voter should not be deprived of his or her vote by \nthe mere failure of the election officers to comply with the formal \npre-requisites of voting. It was, and still is, my honest and \nconsidered view, however, that Sec. 211, par. 27 and the above-mentioned\n doctrines or ruling of the Honorable Supreme Court are not applicable \nxxx.\n\n19. That as regards to the six (6) ballots wherein the protestee \nwas voted for but which were declared invalid in the decision for the \nreason that the same were not signed by the Chairman of the Board of \nElection Inspectors, and my failure to declare invalid the twenty/five \n(25) ballots wherein the protestant was voted for and which are \nlikewise, unsigned by the Chairman, I candidly admit I committed a \nmistake or ommission (sic). My ommission (sic) or mistake however, is \nan honest one and was the result of pure inadvertense (sic); not a \ndeliberate act. xxx\n\n20. That as regards to the three (3) votes for the protestee \nmentioned in the letter-complaint and which are declared invalid in the \ndecision, the invalidation of said votes or ballots were based on what \nappeared in the Book of Voters and in the List of Voters used during the\n May 11, 1992 elections. Thus, in the Book of Voters for precinct No. \n23, Masisit Orlino Acdal who appears in the list of voters used during \nthe May 11, 1992 elections to have voted, is therein indicated as \ndeceased; while Mancita Alegado who appears in the list of voters to \nhave cast her vote in Precinct No. 22-B Masisit, is not a registered \nvoter in the precinct per the Book of Voters because her name does not \nappear therein;\n\n21. Relative to the allegations of the letter-complaint averring \nthat I peeped at the daughter of my former landlady and that I have been\n using the courtâs chamber as my sleeping quarters, there is absolutely \nno truth to the same. As a matter of fact the incidents referred to is \nthe subject of a previous anonymous letter-complaint in relation to \nwhich I have submitted my comments and which had been docketed as \nAdministrative Matter No. RTJ 96-1363 and in connection with the \nsupposed complaint, complainant had never appeared nor located inspite \nof efforts exerted by the Justice of the Court of Appeals to where it \nwas assigned for investigation;\n\n22. That it is not true that I have not been reporting for duty on\n Mondays, Fridays and Thursday afternoons, the truth of the matter being\n that I do work from Monday to Friday and on many instances I even \nworked at home on Saturdays and Sundays when resolving cases involving \ndifficult questions of law, although I seldom conduct trials or hearing \nof cases on Mondays and Fridays because said days are devoted by me to \nmake my decisions and study cases pending trial before the Court;â\n\nOn March 16, 1998, the Court resolved [4] to refer the case to Associate Justice Hilarion L. Aquino of the Court \nof Appeals for investigation, report and recommendation. However, \nJustice Aquino begged leave to be relieved of the case because the \nrespondent is a townmate of his and for a number of years, a former \ncolleague when he (Justice Aquino) was Executive Judge of the Regional \nTrial Court in Tuguegarao, Cagayan. [5]\n\nOn July 8, 1998, the Court assigned the case to Associate Justice\n Bernardo P. Abesamis of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report \nand recommendation. [6]\n\nDuring the hearing on October 15, 1998 before Justice Abesamis, the parties stipulated on the following facts:\n\nâ1. Complainant lacks sufficient evidence to prove that respondent\n judge used his chambers as sleeping quarters; the said allegation is \nconsidered withdrawn;\n\n2. Complainantâs allegation that respondent judge committed an act\n of voyeurism is subject matter of another pending administrative matter\n against respondent, hence, considered withdrawn from this case;\n\n3. Complainantâs allegation that delay visited the disposition of \nElection Case No. 1807-S is not a charge but merely mentioned in passing\n in connection with the said case; and\n\n4. Respondent judge admitted the factual footholds of the following allegations in the complaint:\n\na) he promulgated the decision without setting the date therefor and notifying the parties;\n\nb) he did not observe stare decisis in ruling against the validity of 121 ballots with undetached upper stubs;\n\nc) he erred in invalidating six (6) ballots not signed by the Chairman of the Board of Canvassers;\n\nd) he invalidated the votes of Acdal, Cabulisan and Alegado;\n\ne) he dismissed the protesteeâs counter-protest without discussing the merits thereof; and\n\nf) he resolved Election Case No. 1807-S without hearing on the stipulation of the parties.â [7]\n\nAfter conducting the required investigation, Justice Abesamis culled his findings as follows: [8]\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE COMMITTED GROSS MISCONDUCT FOR SHOWING COMPLAINANT\n A COPY OF HIS UNPROMULGATED DECISION IN ELECTION CASE NO. 1807-S, BUT \nNOT FOR PREPARING TWO DRAFTS OF DECISION AS CHARGED.\n\nRESPONDENT IS LIABLE FOR GROSS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE ERRED IN PROMULGATING THE DECISION IN ELECTION \nCASE NO. 1807-S WITHOUT FIRST SETTING THE DATE THEREFOR WITH NOTICE TO \nTHE PARTIES.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE ERRED IN INVALIDATING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE (121) BALLOTS WITH UNDETACHED UPPER STUBS.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE ERRED IN INVALIDATING SIX (6) BALLOTS FOR BEING UNSIGNED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF CANVASSERS.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE ERRED IN INVALIDATING THE VOTE OF NANCITA \nALEGADO, A TEACHER AND VOTER OF PRECINCT 35 OF SANCHEZ MIRA, CAGAYAN, \nWHO SERVED AS MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF INSPECTORS OF PRECINCT 22-B OF THE \nSAME MUNICIPALITY.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE DISMISSED PROTESTEEâS COUNTER-PROTEST WITHOUT STATING THE FACTS AND LAW ON WHICH THE DISMISSAL WAS BASED.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE IS LIABLE FOR VIOLATION OF CIRCULAR NO. 13 ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCULAR NO. 1.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGEâS ALLEGED VOYEURISM IS DISMISSED AS A COMPLAINT ON\n SIMILAR GROUND WAS ALREADY FILED AT THE TIME OF THE FILING OF THE \nCOMPLAINT IN THIS CASE.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGEâS ALLEGED PRACTICE OF USING HIS CHAMBERS AS SLEEPING QUARTERS IS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF MERIT.\n\nRESPONDENTâS ALLEGED DELAY IN RESOLVING ELECTION CASE NO. 1807-S IS DISMISSED.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGEâS ALLEGED ERROR IN INVALIDATING THE VOTES OF CABULISAN AND ACDAL IS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF MERIT.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGEâS ALLEGED FAILURE TO SET ELECTION CASE NO. 1807-S FOR HEARING SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF MERIT.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGEâS ALLEGED FALSIFICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF SERVICE IS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF MERIT.\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGEâS ALLEGED PARTIALITY TOWARDS COUNSEL FOR THE \nPROTESTANT IN ELECTION CASE NO. 1807-S IS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF MERIT.\n\nand recommended thus:\n\nâWHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, it is respectfully \nrecommended that: (a) respondent judge be fined in the amount equivalent\n to his one (1) month salary for gross ignorance of the law and serious \nmisconduct; (b) the charge of falsification of certificates of service \nbe dismissed for lack of merit; and (c) the charge of inefficiency be \nlikewise dismissed, however, respondent judge be enjoined to observe \nproper trial hours subscribed Circular No. 13.â\n\nThe charge of gross misconduct against respondent judge for allegedly\n showing to complainant a copy of his unpromulgated decision in Election\n Case No. 1807-S, lacks sufficient evidentiary support. In his \nMemorandum of December 9, 1998, the Investigator stated:\n\nâProceeding from the premises that respondent judge drafted two \ndecisions and that Court Stenographer Malvar is of unprejudiced \ndisposition, it is within rhyme and reason to conclude that respondent \njudge likewise gave complainant-protestee a âsneak previewâ of his first\n draft decision. xxxâ [9]\n\nThere is nothing on record to prove that the respondent showed a copy of his subject decision to the complainant.\n\nThat respondent prepared two drafts of his subject decision is of\n no moment. It may be that he changed his mind after preparing one \ndraft or intentionally prepared two drafts for his evaluation and \nconsideration. Besides, the decision became effective only upon its \npromulgation.\n\nBut the acts of respondent constitute gross ignorance of the law, as charged:\n\n1. Respondent admitted that he promulgated the decision in \nElection Case No. 1807-S without first setting the date therefor and \nwith no notice to the parties.\n\nSection 19, Rule 35 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, reads:\n\nâSec. 19. Promulgation and Finality of Decision. - The decision of\n the Court shall be promulgated on a date set by it of which due notice \nmust be given the parties. It shall become final five (5) days after \nits promulgation. No motion for reconsideration shall be entertained.â\n\n2. Respondent invalidated one hundred twenty-one (121) ballots with \nundetached upper stubs contrary to jurisprudence and the provisions of \nthe Omnibus Election Code.\n\nAs admitted by respondent, he did not observe stare decisis in \ninvalidating one-hundred twenty one (121) ballots with undetached upper \nstubs. What the respondent did does not accord with applicable rules and\n jurisprudence:\n\nâSec. 211. Rules for the appreciation of ballots. - In the \nreading and appreciation of ballots, every ballot shall be presumed to \nbe valid unless there is clear and good reason to justify its rejection.\n The board of election inspectors shall observe the following rules, \nbearing in mind that the object of the election is to obtain the \nexpression of the votersâ will:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n27. Failure to remove the detachable coupon from a ballot does not annul such ballot.â [10]\n\nAnd in De los Angeles vs. Rodriguez , [11] citing Lucero vs. De Guzman , [12] the Court held:\n\nââThe circumstance that the coupon bearing the number of a ballot \nis not detached at the time the ballot is voted does not justify the \ncourt in rejecting the ballot. The duty of detaching the coupon is \nplaced by law upon the election officials, and the voter must not be \ndeprived of the franchise by reason of their failure to perform this \nduty.ââ\n\nRespondent, in his 2nd Indorsement, [13] manifested awareness of the foregoing rules and jurisprudence but \ncontended that paragraph 27 of Section 211 of the Omnibus Election Code \n ârefers to the lower stab (sic) of the ballotâ [14] and not the upper stubs involved in the present case.\n\nRespondent erred in making distinctions where the law is clear \nand no distinction is necessary. He erred in not adhering to the \nprecedents set by this Court no matter what his opinion on the matter \nmay be. Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws shall form\n part of the legal system of the Philippines. [15]\n\nIndeed, respondent appears unmindful of his duty as a member of the judiciary:\n\nâ18. Influence of decisions upon the development of the law\n\nA judge should be mindful that his duty is the application of \ngeneral law to particular instance, that ours is a government of laws \nand not of men, and that he violates his duty as a minister of justice \nunder such a system if he seeks to do what he may personally consider \nsubstantial justice in a particular case and disregards the general law \nas he knows it to be binding on him. Such action may have detrimental \nconsequences beyond the immediate controversy. He should administer his\n office with a due regard to the integrity of the system of the law \nitself, remembering that he is not a depository of arbitrary power, but a\n judge under the sanction of law.â ( Canons of Judicial Ethics )\n\n3. Then too, he invalidated six (6) ballots for complainant for \nbeing unsigned by the Chairman of the Board of Canvassers but did not \ninvalidate the ballots cast in favor of protestant which were also \nunsigned by the Chairman.\n\nRespondent admitted having done the same fact but explained that \nit was through mistake or omission. His defense is unsustainable. He \nis liable for violating the rule that failure of the Chairman of the \nBoard of Election Inspectors to comply with his mandated administrative \nresponsibility, i.e., signing, authenticating and thumbmarking of \nballots, should not penalize the voter with disenfranchisement:\n\nâSimilarly, Section 211 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise \nknown as the âOmnibus Election Code of the Philippinesâ provides that in\n the reading and appreciation of ballots, every ballot shall be presumed\n to be valid unless there is a clear and good reason to justify its \nrejection. Certainly, the inefficiency of an election officer in failing\n to affix his signature at the back of the ballot does not constitute as\n a good and clear reason to justify the rejection of a ballot.â [16]\n\n4. So also, he invalidated the vote of Nancita Alegado, a member of \nthe Board of Election Inspectors of Precinct 22 of Sanchez Mira, \nCagayan, on the ground that her name did not appear in the Book of \nVoters.\n\nRespondent likewise violated Section 169 of the Omnibus Election Code, which reads:\n\nâSec. 169. Voting privilege of members of the board of election \ninspectors. - Members of the board of election inspectors and their \nsubstitutes may vote in the polling place where they are assigned on \nelection day; Provided, That they are registered voters within the \nprovince, city or municipality where they are assigned: and Provided, \nfinally, That their voting in the polling places where they are not \nregistered voters be noted in the minutes of the board of election \ninspectors.â\n\nMs. Alegado is a registered voter of Precinct 35 of Sanchez Mira, \nCagayan, but she was serving as an election inspector in Precinct 22-B \nso that she was entitled to vote in the latter precinct. Despite the \ncategorical declaration in the law that she had voting rights, \nrespondent improperly excluded her vote just because Ms. Alegadoâs name \ndid not appear in the Book of Voters.\n\n5. Respondent dismissed complainantâs counter-protest without \nstating the facts and law on which such dismissal was based. In \ndismissing complainantâs counter-protest, respondent disposed:\n\nâWHEREFORE, the protestant Federico Q. Galapia in the \nabove-entitled case should be, as he is hereby declared to be the winner\n in the May 11, 1992 election (sic) for mayor of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan.\n\nThe counter-protest filed by the protestee is hereby dismissed for lack of merit, with costs de oficio.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED.â [17]\n\nTherefrom, it can be gleaned unerringly that respondent never \ndiscussed in the body of his decision the basis for the dismissal of the\n counter-protest. In so doing, he violated a basic legal principle, a \nconstitutional one at that, [18] that in making a decision, the facts and the law upon which the decision is based must be expressed clearly and distinctly.\n\nAll the foregoing studiedly considered, the Court is of the \nirresistible conclusion that respondent Judge is guilty of gross \nignorance of the law. He should be reminded of paragraph 2 of Circular \nNo. 13 (SUBJECT: GUIDELINES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE) in \nrelation to which circular the Court enunciated the rule that â[j]udges \nshould keep abreast of the rulings and doctrines laid down by the \nSupreme Court and apply them to appropriate cases regardless of their \npersonal opinion.â [19]\n\nThe laws that respondent violated or failed to apply are not \ncomplicated, and do not involve difficult questions of law. His failure\n to apply basic legal principles constitutes utter disregard of \nwell-settled doctrines.\n\n6. Respondent also failed to observe office hours as required by Circular No. 13. [20]\n\nâGUIDELINES FOR TRIAL COURTS\n\nThe following guidelines are hereby issued for all trial courts:\n\n1. Punctuality and strict observance of office hours. - Punctuality\n in the holding of scheduled hearings is an imperative. Trial judges \nshould strictly observe the requirement of at least eight hours of service a day ,\n five hours of which should be devoted to trial, specifically from 8:30 \na.m. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 to 4:30 p.m. as required by par. 5 of \nthe Interim Rules issued by the Supreme Court on January 11, 1983, \npursuant to Sec. 16 of BP 129.â\n\nand Administrative Circular No. 1: [21]\n\nâxxx xxx xxx\n\n2. Maximum Use of Judge Time and Effective Court Management:\n\n2.1 All Presiding Judges are directed to comply strictly with the \nguidelines established in Circular No. 13, July 1, 1987, on punctuality \nand observance of office hours, effective use of pre-trial and discovery\n procedure, effective management of trials, the availment of annual \nconferences.â\n\nRespondent, in his 2nd Indorsement [22] dated August 27, 1997, stated:\n\nâ22. That it is not true that I have not been reporting for duty \non Mondays, Fridays and Thursday afternoons, the truth of the matter \nbeing that I do work from Monday to Friday (sic) and on (sic) many \ninstances I even worked at home on Saturdays and Sundays when resolving \ncases involving difficult questions of law, although I seldom conduct \ntrials or hearing of cases on Mondays and Fridays because said days are \ndevoted by me to make my decisions and study cases pending trial before \nthe Court;â\n\nRespondent admitted not holding trials on Mondays and Fridays, \ncontrary to the instruction of the Court. Respondent has to be reminded\n that proper and efficient utilization of office hours for hearings and \ntrials is to ensure a speedy administration of justice.\n\n1. Respondentâs voyeurism was the subject of Administrative \nMatter No. 96-1363 which had been resolved by the Court in a Decision \ndated October 12, 1998, disposing thus:\n\nââWHEREFORE, for his disgraceful acts of voyeurism committed \nagainst Marilyn C. Dumayas, respondent Judge Adrian N. Pagalilauan, \nRTC-Br. 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, is fined P10,000.00 with warning that\n a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more \nseverely.ââ [23]\n\n2. The charge that respondent has been using his chambers as sleeping\n quarters is anemic of evidentiary support and is therefore dismissed.\n\n3. The alleged delay in the disposition of Election Case No. \n1807-S is also dismissed because complainant stipulated that the same is\n not a charge but merely mentioned in connection with the election case.\n Besides, Justice Abesamis found no evidence of delay in the \ndisposition of subject election case.\n\n4. Respondentâs alleged error in nullifying the votes of \nCabulisan and Acdal is likewise dismissed for lack of corroborating \nevidence to substantiate the same.\n\n5. Respondentâs alleged failure to set Election Case No. 1807-S for hearing should also be dismissed because:\n\nâFirst, as the record of the case bears him out, complainant was \namenable to the submission of the case for decision without hearing. In\n an Order, dated February 21, 1995, respondent judge explicit[ly] \ninstructed with caveat that âthe parties hereby given twenty (20) days \nfrom today to submit their respective memorandum. With or without their\n memoranda, the case will be submitted for decision.â The parties, \nincluding complainant, did not manifest their objection in open court or\n move for the reconsideration of said order in writing. Instead, they \nsubmitted their respective compliance thereto.\n\nSecond, it is duly noted that when complainant saw the first draft \nof decision, which he alleged was in his favor, there was no fuss over \nthe lack of hearing. xxxâ\n\n6. The charge of falsification of Certificates of Service is also dismissed in view of the absence of proof.\n\n7. The charge that respondent has been partial in favor of the \ncounsel for the protestant in Election Case No. 1807-S is also dismissed\n for lack of merit. The Clerk of Court of Branch 12, Regional Trial \nCourt, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, has certified that since the respondent \nbecame the Presiding Judge, there was only one criminal case which was \nreconsidered, from conviction to acquittal, and that it was counsel for \nprotestant, Atty. Victoriano Pascua, who appeared as the private \nprosecutor in the said case. Furthermore, Atty. Pascua has a lot of \ncases pending in the sala of the respondent that somehow explains the \nlong hours he spends in the courtroom.\n\nJustice Abesamis recommended that the respondent be fined in an \namount equivalent to one (1) month salary, for gross ignorance of the \nlaw. Respondent was once administratively fined P10,000.00 in \nAdministrative Matter No. 96-1363. The current salary of a regional \ntrial court judge is P24,127.00 a month.\n\nWHEREFORE , respondent Judge Adrian N. \nPagalilauan is found GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law and is hereby\n FINED in the amount of TEN THOUSAND (P10,000.00) PESOS.\n\nThe charges of serious misconduct, falsification of certificates of service and inefficiency are DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nMelo, (Chairman), Vitug, Panganiban , and Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 4-11.\n\n[2] Rollo, p. 25.\n\n[3] Ibid., pp. 27-39.\n\n[4] Rollo, p. 85.\n\n[5] Rollo, pp. 86-87.\n\n[6] Ibid., p. 88.\n\n[7] Memorandum dated December 9, 1998, p. 19.\n\n[8] Ibid.\n\n[9] Ibid., pp. 24-25.\n\n[10] Section 211 (27), Omnibus Election Code.\n\n[11] 46 Phil. 595.\n\n[12] 45 Phil. 852.\n\n[13] Rollo, pp. 26-39.\n\n[14] Rollo, p. 36.\n\n[15] Article 8, Civil Code of the Philippines.\n\n[16] Punzalan vs. Commission on Elections, 289 SCRA 702, 715.\n\n[17] Rollo, p. 20.\n\n[18] Section 14, \nArticle VIII, 1987 Constitution: âNo decision shall be rendered by any \ncourt without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and \nthe law on which it is based.â\n\n[19] Dated July 1, 1987.\n\n[20] Ibid.\n\n[21] Dated January 28, 1988.\n\n[22] Rollo, pp. 26-39.\n\n[23] Memorandum, supra, p. 36.",
