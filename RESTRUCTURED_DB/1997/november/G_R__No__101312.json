Thereafter, he went to their purported office at the Talisman Placement Agency (agency) in General Luna St., Ermita, Manila, to tender a downpayment of P40,000.00, but Recio instructed him to forward said amount to Valencia at their house in Caloocan City.\n\nSoon after receiving said amount and issuing a receipt therefor, Valencia went to Cabiao bearing Vicenteâs Japanese visa. Encouraged by this development, the latter gave her the additional P50,000.00. When he proceeded to the agency to procure the ticket, however, he was informed that the processing of the necessary papers and release of the ticket would take a long time. Because of this, Vicente filed the instant complaint against appellants.\n\nGarcia narrated that she likewise went to the agency for prospective employment in Taiwan. Subsequently, appellants told her to secure a passport and a certificate that she has undergone medical examination, which documents she submitted on April 17 and May 5, 1992, respectively. In the course of the processing of her application, she allegedly paid P4,000.00 for her medical examination and another P1,000.00 for some undetermined purpose. In both instances, no receipt was issued to her.\n\nReyes, for her part, testified that in order to come up with the P15,000.00 amount required by appellants, she pledged her jewelries and even went as far as mortgaging her ricefield. Despite such payment, however, she, like the other two complainants mentioned above, was unable to leave the country.\n\nThe defense, on the other hand, relied on the uncorroborated testimonies of appellants who denied the charges and imputed culpability to each other.\n\nAppellant Recio, a licensed physical therapist, with office at Cuyab Hot Springs in Calamba, Laguna, testified that he met his co-accused at Tierra Mar Clinic in United Nations Avenue, Ermita, Manila. On April 5, 1992, he was invited by Valencia to attend a fiesta in Cabiao where they met Vicente through the latterâs aunt. He alleged that he never offered Vicente any possible employment in Japan as factory worker, so he could not have required the latter to give him a placement fee of P90,000.00. Recio asserted further that he had no personal relationship with appellant Valencia and that if ever there was any, it would be on a professional basis, as the latter procures clients for him as a therapist. However, he admitted that Vicente went to see him at the agency to tender the amount required but he instructed the latter to pay Valencia at her house in Caloocan City. He feigned ignorance of their transaction or the purpose for which the said amount was intended.\n\nRecio likewise admitted meeting Garcia during the Cabiao fiesta but denied discussing with her the possibility of overseas employment and alleged that it was Valencia with whom she had a conversation.\n\nIn contrast with her co-appellantâs testimony, Valencia testified that she met Recio at a clinic in U.N. Avenue, Ermita, Manila, where he informed her that he needed twenty-five persons to work in Taiwan. In turn, she alleged that she herself was an applicant and was even promised by Recio a free ticket to Taiwan if she could help him find the requisite number of prospective workers. Soon thereafter, both of them went to Cabiao, where she introduced him to several persons as a recruiter. At this juncture, he began distributing calling cards and urged interested applicants to go to the office indicated therein. Later, he advised the applicants to go instead to the Talisman Agency at 1202 General Luna St., Malate, Manila, because he was already leaving the agency indicated in the calling card.\n\nValencia contended that when she applied for employment abroad with Recio, other applicants followed suit. They went to the agency and met its owner, a certain Jerry Arciaga, who allegedly collected P60,000.00 from her. Subsequently, all of them informed Recio that Arciaga received their supposed placement fees, but he purportedly disclaimed any participation in the transaction. For her failure to send them abroad, the complainants blamed Valencia for introducing Recio to them. She added that when she met Recio in Batangas, she requested him to return the money, but Recio ignored her. Thus, upon learning of his arrest by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), she went over to the NBI office along Taft Avenue and was told therein that she is being implicated because her signature appeared in several receipts of payment issued to the complainants. She insisted that she herself was a victim of Recioâs fraudulent scheme.\n\nIn its decision dated October 10, 1994, [4] the trial court convicted appellants in this wise:\n\nâWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:\n\n1)           In Criminal Case no. 92-108476 finding accused Sixto Recio y Magpantay alias âRestyâ and Zenaida Valencia y de Valencia of illegal recruitment committed in large scale and hereby sentences them to serve the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00;\n\n2)           In Criminal Case no. 92-108477 finding accused, Sixto Recio y Magpantay and Zenaida Valencia y de Valencia as principals of estafa by means of false pretenses and hereby sentences them to suffer imprisonment of not less than FOUR (4) YEARS, TWO (2) MONTHS as minimum, and not more than SIX (6) YEARS, FIVE (5) MONTHS and ELEVEN (11) DAYS as maximum;\n\n3)           And in Criminal Case no. 92-108478 convicting Sixto Recio y Magpantay alias âRestyâ and Zenaida Valencia y de Valencia of the crime of estafa by means of false pretenses as principals and hereby sentences them also to serve the penalty of FOUR (4) YEARS, TWO (2) MONTHS as minimum, and not more than FIVE (5) YEARS, FIVE (5) MONTHS and ELEVEN (11) DAYS as maximum.\n\nWith costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.â [5]\n\nBefore this Court, appellants assail the judgment of conviction arguing that the lower court failed to prove their complicity in the offenses charged.\n\nRecio alleges, among other things, that he has no participation in the recruitment activities of his co-accused Valencia and that the evidence clearly show that it was only the latter who induced the complainants to apply for employment abroad and did in fact receive the amounts intended as placement fees. Valencia, on the other hand, contends that her only involvement in the matter was the referral of complainants to the Talisman Placement Agency.\n\nThe implausible arguments adduced by appellants fail to persuade us.\n\nThe prosecution propounded clear and convincing evidence to prove the participation of appellants in the commission of the crime of illegal recruitment. Illegal recruitment is committed when two requisites concur, to wit:\n\n1)  That the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable one to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; and\n\n2)  That the offender undertakes either any activity within the meaning of ârecruitment and placementâ defined under Article 13(b), [6] or any prohibited practice enumerated under Article 34 [7] of the Labor Code, as amended.\n\nAccordingly, illegal recruitment is now an offense which is essentially committed by non-licensees or non-holders of authority. Licensees or holders of authority may, however, incur criminal liability for violation of other provisions of Title I, Book I of the Labor Code, such as Article 29, 32, or 34, which are penalized under Article 39(b) of the Code.\n\nThe record shows that, indeed, appellants offered prospective employment abroad to the complainants for a monetary consideration. Collectively, complainants narrated the same story. They asserted that appellants, representing themselves as husband and wife, offered them work abroad and exacted money from them, the amount being more than what is legally required, in the guise of a placement or processing fee. This notwithstanding, appellantsâ promises remained unfulfilled, leaving the complainants penniless, with no other recourse but to seek redress from the courts for the wrong committed against them.\n\nThe testimonies of the complainants undoubtedly reveal appellants âto be the culprits in an elaborate scheme to defraud the hopeful applicants for overseas work.â [8] âIn the matter of credibility of witnesses, we reiterate the familiar and well-entrenched rule that the factual findings of the trial courts should be respected. The judge a quo was in a better position to pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses, having personally heard them when they testified and observed their deportment and manner of testifying. It is doctrinally settled that the evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect, because it had the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and detect if they were telling the truth. This assessment is binding upon the appellate court in the absence of a clear showing that it was reached arbitrarily or that the trial court had plainly overlooked certain facts of substance or value that if considered might affect the result of the case.â [9]\n\nRecio contends that the evidence adduced by the prosecution is insufficient to sustain his conviction on the ground that the testimonies of the complainants were not corroborated by other witnesses.\n\nSuch overused, timeworn contention is unacceptable.\n\nAs held in People v. Pabalan, [10] âcorroborative evidence is necessary only when there are reasons to warrant the suspicion that the witness falsified the truth or that his observation had been inaccurate.â This is buttressed by the fact that appellants failed to show any reason why complainants would impute to them the charge of illegal recruitment.\n\nRecio also argues that he should not be held liable for the crime of estafa on the ground that he was not the one who received the payments tendered by complainants.\n\nThis argument again is untenable.\n\nThe Court finds ample evidence that appellants acted in conspiracy in inducing the complainants to pay them placement fees. Their testimonies clearly manifest that appellants represented themselves as recruiters, first: by demanding and receiving placement fees; and second: by prescribing the documents needed for employment abroad. Thus, it can be inferred from the conduct of appellants that âthey acted in unison with each other, evincing a common purpose or design. [11]\n\nClearly, appellants were motivated by prospects of illicit gain at the expense of hapless and desperate victims whose only desire was to secure decent jobs for themselves abroad even if it meant being away from their families, as long as they could send money to assure them a modicum of sustenance. Accordingly, let the full force of the law fall upon these heartless malefactors.\n\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED and the decision of the trial court finding appellants Sixto Recio and Zenaida Valencia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal recruitment and estafa is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that appellants in Criminal Cases No. 92-108477 and 108478 shall each suffer the penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day; and four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day as minimum to six (6) years and one (1) day, as maximum, respectively.\n\nAppellants are also ORDERED to return and pay to RUEL V. VICENTE the amount of NINETY THOUSAND PESOS (P90,000.00); and to ROWENA L. REYES the amount of FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15,000.00).
