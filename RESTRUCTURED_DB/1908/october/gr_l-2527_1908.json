CARRILLO,\n\npetitioner-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nTHE INSULAR GOVERNMENT, ET AL.,\n\nrespondents-appellants.\n\nAttorney-General Araneta for the Government.\n\nCarlos Ledesma for appellee.\n\nWILLARD,\n\nJ.:\n\nThis is an appeal from the Court of Land Registration. The plaintiff asked to have registered in his name two tracts of land, the first containing 107 hectares, and the second containing 74 hectares. The only evidence which he presented to prove his ownership was a patent from the Spanish Government issued on the 5th day of June, 1895, in proceedings for the adjustment of public lands. The grant made by this patent was not gratuitous, but the petitioner paid for the land.\n\nAccording to the patent, the first tract of land contained 26 hectares. According to the petition presented in this proceeding it now contains 107 hectares. According to the patent the second tract contained 38 hectares. According to the petition it now contains 74 hectares.\n\nThis case is very similar to the cases of\n\nPamintuan vs. The Insular Government\n\n(8 Phil. Rep., 485);\n\nPamintuan vs. The Insular Government\n\n(8 Phil. Rep., 512), and\n\nParas vs. The Insular Government\n\n, No. 2525, just decided.\n\n1\n\nlawphil.net\n\nIn this case, as in the others, the petitioner failed to prove that the lands described in his petition are the same lands described in the patents. The judgment in his favor, therefore, can not be sustained. It is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded to the court below the further proceedings in which the petitioner will have an opportunity of bringing himself, if he can, within the provisions of section 54 of Act No. 926. No costs will be allowed to either party in this case. So ordered.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Carson and Tracey, JJ., concur.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nPage 378,\n\nsupra\n\n.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
