MOISES PANO Y BAYLOSIS, MARIANO FUENTES Y BAYLOSIS, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTORRES, JR., J.:\n\nAssailed in this appeal is a decision rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch 13, in Criminal Cases Nos. CBU-8544 and CBU-8545 finding appellants; MOISES PANO y BAYLOSIS and MARIANO FUENTES y BAYLOSIS guilty of the crime of MURDER in both cases.\n\nPano and Fuentes were charged, together with Crisanto Fuentes, with the crime of Murder qualified by treachery and attended by the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, for the killing of Sisenando and Nestor Limbaga. The charges, contained in two separate informations, [1] read:\n\nCBU-8544\n\n\"That on or about the 20th day of November, 1985 at around 7: 30 oâclock in the evening, more or less, in Sitio Ampac, Barangay Cerdena, Municipality of Malabuyoc, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping with each other, with means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, attack, assault, shoot and stab therewith Sisenando Limbaga, in the different parts of the body, inflicting upon him gunshot wound and lacerated wound; and as a result thereof, said Sisenando Limbaga died instantly due to intracranial hemorrhage, shock, secondary to gunshot wound in the cranial cavity.\n\nAll contrary to law, and with the qualifying circumstance of alevosia, and the generic aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\"\n\nCBU-8545\n\n\"That on or about the 20th day of November, 1985 at around 7: 30 oâclock in the evening, more or less, in Sitio Ampac, Barangay Cerdena, Municipality of Malabuyoc, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other, with deliberate intent and interest to kill, and by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, attack, assault, shoot and stab therewith Nestor Limbaga in the different parts of the body, inflicting upon him sixteen (16) stab and gunshot wounds; and as a result thereof, said Nestor Limbaga died instantly due to hemorrhage, shock, secondary to stab wounds penetrating the heart, liver, lung and intestines.\n\nAll contrary to law, and with the qualifying circumstances of alevosia and the given aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\"\nArraigned on July 18, 1986, [2] the two accused pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged. The two cases were then consolidated, and a joint trial on the merits ensued.\n\nThe court a quo rendered its decision on June 20, 1990, convicting accused MOISES PANO and MARIANO FUENTES with the crime of Murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, for the killing of the victims. [3]\n\nThe dispositive portion of the decision of the trial court reads:\n\nxxx           xxx           xxx\n\n\"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused MOISES PANO and MARIANO FUENTES, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in -\n\nCRIMINAL CASE NO. CBU-8544 - of the crime of murder and hereby sentences each of them to a penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to indemnify the heirs of Nestor Limbaga the sum of P30, 000. 00.\n\nCRIMINAL CASE NO. 8545 - of the crime of murder and hereby sentences each of them to a penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to indemnify the heirs of Nestor Limbaga the sum of P30, 000. 00.\n\nWith costs against them in both cases.\n\nxxx           xxx           xxx\nAccused CRISANTO FUENTES, however, was exonerated from any liability [4] thus:\n\n\"Accused CRISANTO FUENTES is hereby acquitted of the crime charged in both information. The CPDRA jail warden is hereby directed to immediately effect his release, unless there is any other legal ground for his continued detention.\"\nOn account of the acquittal of Crisanto Fuentes, he is not included as a party in the instant appeal.\n\nAppellants, filed their Notice of Appeal in the lower court on 4 July 1990, invoking this Courtâs appellate jurisdiction. [5]\n\nThe events leading to the killing of the victims, and thereafter, rest largely on the testimonies of the following prosecution witnesses: [6]\n\nGregorio Malabon testified that on November 13, 1985, he, together with appellants, Daniel Allanic and Vidal Fuentes were at the latterâs house, celebrating the baptism of appellant Marianoâs child. At this gathering, the appellants came to their decision to kill Sisenando Limbaga and Nestor Limbaga. When Malabon asked them the reason for their plan, he was told to stay out of it because he had no business relating thereto.\n\nMoises Pano allegedly repeated the same statement on November 20, 1985 at 3:00 oâclock in the afternoon, this time in the house of Daniel Allanic, while Malabon, Pano and Allanic were having another drinking splurge. Thereupon, Pano dropped a 38 cal. Revolver on the table and later, left the group. He returned to Danielâs house at 9:30 oâclock in the evening, together with Mariano Fuentes who was wearing a bloody shirt. Moises Pano told those present, \"do not go to Barangay Ampac because Sisenando and Nestor Limbaga are already dead.\"\n\nWitness Iluminada Limbaga testifying for the prosecution, related that she witnessed how the two appellants attacked and killed her father and cousin, the victims in this case.\n\nOn November 20, 1985, at 7:30 oâclock in the evening, she was sitting by the door of her house, which was about four fathoms away from the victim. Suddenly, she heard a shot and looked towards the direction or origin of the sound. She saw Moises Pano shoot her father Sisenando Limbaga and then turn and shoot at Nestor Limbaga, who was able to dodge the shot. Then she saw Mariano Fuentes, together with an unidentified person, overtake and subdue Nestor Limbaga. Mariano stabbed Nestor several times. Now frustrated and immobile, Nestor was likewise shot by Moises Pano three or four times. Thereafter, the appellant and the unidentified assailant left the scene of the crime.\n\nThe thrust of this appeal is on the alleged weakness of the appelleeâs case arising from the implausibility of the prosecutionâs evidence. In appellantsâ brief, they maintained that the lower court erred in at least two instances, particularly:\n\nI\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES DESPITE THE LEGAL IMPURITIES ATTACHED THERETO; AND IN DISREGARDING OR DISCREDITING DEFENSE EVIDENCE.\n\nII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING MOISES PANO AND MARIANO FUENTES GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIMES CHARGED. [7]\nAppellants alleged that \"in the case obtaining, cursory reading of the appealed decision will certainly show that the prosecutionâs evidence was appreciated by the trial court with precipitate credulity, such that the inherent loopholes saddling it went unnoticed despite its significance. The trial court anchored its conviction of the accused-appellants on the eyewitness account of Iluminada Limbaga and the testimony of Gregorio Malabon. However, after analyzing their testimonies, one cannot help but doubt their veracity. It has often been said that evidence to be believed must not only come from the mouth of credible witnesses, it must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.\" [8]\n\nAgain, the decisive issue in the case at bar, is the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution. Consequently, a review of the evidence is in order.\n\nThe prosecutionâs case is beefed up by the weight given to the testimony of Iluminada Limbaga, the victimsâ daughter and cousin, The lower court found her testimony to be normal and credible.\n\nAppellants would have us discredit Iluminada as a witness because relative to the incident testified to by her, she merely stood by and let her loved ones die. Her reaction, or the lack of it, shows that she was not truly present at the scene of the crime, since her natural reaction would have been to come to the aid of the victims. We are not persuaded by this submission for appellants. It is noteworthy to state in this regard that as a matter of common observation and knowledge, the reaction or behavior of persons when confronted with a shocking incident varies. [9]\n\nIn the case at bar, the sex and state of mind of Iluminada considering, coupled with the gruesome scene which she just saw, the young lass would naturally freeze with fear and shock. Overwhelmed with fear, she could not have come to the aid of her loved ones, considering that the assailants were armed with a gun and knife.\n\nIn People vs. Panlilio, [10] we stated--more importantly, ample margin of error and understanding should be accorded to young witnesses who much more than adults, would be gripped with tension due to the novelty of testifying before a court.\"\n\nAppellants also alleged that Iluminadaâs declarations that she was residing in the city at the time the crime was committed, was inconsistent with her claim that she witnessed the carnage, which occurred in Sitio Ampac. The court a quo found this inconsistency to be trifling, for the reason that it was not impossible for Iluminada to be at home in Sitio Ampac when the crime was committed. It appears that Iluminada would stay in Malabuyoc to attend school at the Perpetual Succor Academy, but would on occasions be at Sitio Ampac to be with her family. Iluminada testified that she had stopped going to school in 1984, upon her parentsâ order. [11] Thus -\n\nFISCAL M. V. PARANDANG\n\nQ: On November 20, 1985, were you still schooling?\n\nA: I studied up to 1984.\n\nQ: So in short, Miss Limbaga, you were telling a lie when you said that you stopped schooling because of the death of your father, that was on November 20, 1985, am I right?\n\nA: What I meant was that I was studying in 1983-1984 but in the following year 1985-1986, I stopped schooling because my parents decided to send my older brother to the city to study.\nObviously on November 20, 1985, when Iluminadaâs father was killed, she was in their place or house in her barrio.\n\nAppellants insist that the court a quo should have given more weight to the testimonies of their witnesses which were uniform in providing the appellants with convenient alibis. [12] It appears on record that these defense witnesses were either wives or mothers of the accused, who in almost all instances, would freely perjure themselves for the sake of their loved ones. [13] In People vs. Flores, [14] we stated that - \"the defense of alibi may not prosper if it is established mainly by the accused themselves and their relatives, and not by credible persons.\"\n\nAs against their positive identification by the prosecution witness, the appellantsâ alibis, which constitute the sum of their defense, becomes weak. Well-entrenched is the rule that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the prosecution witnesses. [15]\n\nAlibi is one of the weakest defenses. Easily susceptible of concoction, it is invariably viewed with suspicion and may be considered only when established by positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence. To be given credence, it must be established that it was impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the same time. [16] Not only was it physically very possible for both appellants to be present at the scene of the crime, the distance of their alleged locations at that time was at most a mere two (2) kilometers, coupled with the fact that the prosecution witnesses positively pointed to the accused as the assailants.\n\nIt appears on record that witness Iluminada Limbaga testifying for the prosecution gave a straightforward testimony as to her account of the incident. This assures the objectivity of the testimony of the witness, thereby bolstering its claim to truth. Absence of evidence as to improper motive actuating the principal witnesses of the prosecution strongly tends to sustain that no improper motive existed and, thus, their testimony is worthy of full faith and credit. [17]\n\nAs it is, the existence of motive on the part of the appellants to kill the Limbagas is immaterial in the case at bar. The appellantsâ motive, or the lack of it, is inconsequential where they were positively identified as the ones who shot and stabbed the victims. The rule is recognized that the prosecution need not prove motive on the part of the accused when the latter has been positively identified as the author of the crime. [18]\n\nThe trial court based its ruling on the attendance of evident premeditation on the testimony ofGregorio Malabon, relative to the occurrences on November 13, 1985 and the afternoon of November 20, 1985, when the appellants allegedly decided to kill the victims. [19]\n\nGregorio Malabon testified to buttress the fact of the appellantsâ premeditating the commission of the crime, [20] to wit:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | Now, on November 13, where were you?\nA: | We attended the affair in the house of Vidal Fuentes and Mariano Fuentes.\nQ: | What affair was that?\nA: | It was an affair wherein the child of Mariano Fuentes was baptized.\nQ: | Now, who are your companions in the house of the accused?\nA: | Moises Pano, Daniel Allanic, and Vidal Fuentes were my companions.\nQ: | Was Mariano Fuentes present?\nA: | Yes, sir.\nQ: | What conversation if any did you have?\nA: | Moises Pano and Mariano Fuentes had a plan to kill Sinsin Limbaga.\nQ: | This Sinsin Limbaga that you are mentioning, is he the same Sisenando Limbaga who is one of the victims in these cases?\nA: | Yes, sir.\nQ: | You said that Moises Pano and Mariano Fuentes planned to kill Sisenando Limbaga, what else did they say about this plan?\nA: | They said they would kill Sisenando Limbaga.\nQ: | What else did they say about the plan?\nA: | They said they would kill.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: Now, on November 13, where were you?

Or in other words, did you also converse with them during that time?\nA: | Yes, Your Honor.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: Mr. Malabon, did you participate in any way in the conversation of Mariano Fuentes and Moises Pano? Or in other words, did you also converse with them during that time? A: Yes, Your Honor.\nAppellants indicated as error when the court a quo accepted the testimony of Gregorio Malabon. It was, according to appellants, improbable for them to have planned the killing of the victims in witnessâ Malabonâs presence. This, to our mind, is untenable considering that witness Malabon was a close friend of appellants, and therefore, could not be biased against the appellants. Besides, the most candid witnesses oftentimes make mistakes and fall into confused and inconsistent statements, but such honest lapses do not necessarily affect their credibility. [21]\n\nOn the basic postulate that the guilt of the accused-appellants has been established beyond reasonable doubt, we find the same to have been fully satisfied and perforce agree with the findings of the trial court.\n\nWe observed, however, that the court a quo resolved to indemnify the heirs of Sesinando Limbaga in the amount of P30, 000. 00 and also, the heirs of Nestor Limbaga, the same amount of P30, 000. 00 respectively. Consistent with the prevailing case law, the indemnity should be increased to Fifty Thousand (P50, 000. 00) Pesos, [22] for the heirs of the victims.\n\nConsidering the foregoing premises, we are restating the accepted rule -\"that the matter of assigning values to the testimony of witnesses is best performed by the trial courts because, unlike appellate courts, they can weigh such testimony in the light of the demeanor, conduct and attitude of the witnesses at the trial.\" [23] Unless the court a quo has overlooked certain facts of substance and value that might affect the result if considered, the findings of the same must be accorded full respect and credit. After a thorough review of the law and evidence, we find no such infraction in the case at bar.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the joint decision of the trial court dated June 20, 1990, convicting accused-appellants for the crime of Murder is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification as indicated above with respect to the amounts of indemnity.\n\nCosts against appellants.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nRegalado, (Chairman), Romero, Puno, and Mendoza, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Record, Vol. I, pp. 1 and 2.\n\n[2] Rollo, p. 32.\n\n[3] Record, Vol. 2, p. 238.\n\n[4] Record, Vol. 2., p. 263.\n\n[5] Ibid., p. 257.\n\n[6] TSN, Gregorio Malabon testified on September 2, 1986 and on September 24, 1986, while Iluminada Limbaga testified on November 11, 1986 and December 3, 1986.\n\n[7] Rollo, page 68.\n\n[8] Appellantâs Brief, Rollo, p. 77.\n\n[9] People vs. Arroyo, G.R.
