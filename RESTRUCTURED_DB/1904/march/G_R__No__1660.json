She was not, therefore, during that time deprived of her liberty within the meaning of article 481 of the Penal Code.\n\nThis case can not be distinguished from cases heretofore decided by this court. (United States\n\nvs.\n\nQuevengco, No. 1208, August 6, 1903; 1 United States\n\nvs.\n\nChu Cheng, No. 1112, April 2, 1903. 2)\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the defendants acquitted, with costs of both instances de oficio, and without prejudice to the presentation of a complaint against the defendant Gregoria for corruption of minors and a complaint against the defendant Arsenio for estupro.\n\nArellano, C.
