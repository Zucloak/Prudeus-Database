No. 2772           September 21, 1906\n\nTHE UNITED STATES,\n\nplaintiff-appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nLOUIS A. UNSELT,\n\ndefendant-appellant.\n\nW.A. Kincaid, for appellant.\n\nOffice of the Solicitor-General, Araneta, for appellee.\n\nWILLARD,\n\nJ.:\n\nThere was evidence in the case sufficient to prove that the defendant, Unselt, after the promulgation of Act No. 518 relating to brigandage, and prior to his first arrest on the 5th day of February, 1903, committed acts which were in violation of that law. After he was arrested in February, he entered into the service of the Constabulary as a detective. He was discharged from such service and again arrested in July, 1903.\n\nWhether during this time, and particularly in connection with his visit to the camp of Felizardo, he committed any acts in violation of law we have not inquired because we are satisfied that the evidence as to acts committed prior to his first arrest is sufficient to sustain the judgment.\n\nThe defendant claims that after his affairs arrest he entered into the service of the Constabulary under the promise that he should not be prosecuted for any acts committed prior to that time. We have not considered whether such promises were or were not made, for with this question we have nothing to do.\n\nIf they were made they would not constitute any defense to this action.\n\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\n\nAfter the expiration of ten days let final judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter let the case be returned to the court below for proper action. So ordered.\n\nArellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Carson and Tracey, JJ.,\n\nconcur.\n\nThe Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation",
