SILVESTRE, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N PARDO, J.: The CaseThe petition is one for review on certiorari[1] seeking to set aside (a) the decision of the Court of Appeals[2] nullifying the preventive suspension order issued by petitioner Ombudsman; and (b) the resolution[3] denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.The Ombudsman issued an order of preventive suspension[4] in connection with the administrative charges for grave misconduct, dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service that Task Force Aduana filed with the Office of the Ombudsman against respondent Ronnie C. Silvestre and Atty. Redempto Somera.On February 14, 2000, respondent filed with the Ombudsman a motion for the lifting of the order of preventive suspension. However, on April 03, 2000, the Ombudsman denied the motion.On May 31, 2000, respondent filed with the Court of Appeals[5] a petition for certiorari and prohibition with temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction questioning the order of preventive suspension issued by petitioner Ombudsman.After due proceedings, on August 14, 2000, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision[6] annulling and setting aside the order of preventive suspension against respondent for having been issued by the Ombudsman in grave abuse of discretion.On October 06, 2000, the Court of Appeals denied a motion for reconsideration filed by the Solicitor General.Hence, this petition.[7]The FactsOn January 26, 2000, elements of Task Force \"Aduana\" headed by petitioner Doctor conducted an entrapment operation in a case of bribery involving Atty. Redempto C. Somera, Hearing Officer, Law Division, Bureau of Customs, Manila, and Indian nationals who had pending cases of seizure with the former.After the pay-off materialized, petitioner Doctor announced the entrapment and then arrested Atty. Somera and two (2) Indian nationals, namely, Murli Tejoomal Mohrani and Kumar Rupchand Khiatani, for violation of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code. As a consequence, the Task Force filed with the Regional Trial Court, Manila, charges of bribery, violation of R. A. No. 3019, and corruption of public officials against them.Likewise, the Task Force filed with the Ombudsman administrative charges for grave misconduct, dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service against respondent Ronnie C. Silvestre and Atty. Somera.The IssueThe issue is whether the Ombudsman has authority to suspend from office respondent Ronnie C. Silvestre indefinitely on the basis of the administrative complaint filed with his office showing that evidence of guilt is strong.The Court's RulingWe need not resolve the issue presented. We dismiss the petition. It has become moot.On February 14, 2001, the Ombudsman dismissed the administrative charges against respondent. In dismissing the charges, the Ombudsman categorically ruled as follows:\"It is another story, however, as regards respondent SILVESTRE. In implicating respondent SILVESTRE in the instant case, Atty. DOCTOR stated in his AFFIDAVIT OF ARREST AND COMPLAINT, the following:`6. That after the hearing of the case (S.I. No. 00-005) on January 20, 2000, ATTY.

DOCTOR on January 20, 2000, was the legal issue on the continued detention of some kitchen wares which were not covered by the Warrant of Seizure and Detention (WSD).
