[5] Counsel for appellant capsulized the evidence for the defense; thus:\n\n\"Evidence for the defense shows that since 1986, accused-appellant, his wife and his two (2) children resided at Bonfal Proper, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.  When his wife, Aprilyn left for Hongkong in 1991, his daughter, Massachusette was left with him while his son, Romeo, Jr., stayed with his mother-in-law, Primitiva Aggabao at Inatub, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. When his son started attending school in 1994, he brought him home to Bonfal.  Accused-appellant described his daughter as a normal child who attended school at Bonfal Pilot Central School where she actively participated in their school activities.  Accused-appellant further testified that in the beginning, he had a fine relationship with his mother-in-law until they had a little misunderstanding over a T.V. set which caused her mother in law to leave and went back to Inatub.  When his wife came from abroad, accused-appellant and his mother-in-law had another misunderstanding concerning a parcel of land bought by his wife.  Since then, they harboured ill-feelings towards each other.\n\n\"As to the charges of three (3) counts of rape against him, accused-appellant testified that these could not be true because on June 11, 1994, Massachussette was then in Inatub and slept with her brother and grandmother.  On the second charge of rape, accused-appellant testified that for the whole month of October, Massachussette had her own beddings while he slept with his son, Romeo, Jr.  Likewise, he could not have raped his daughter on December 5, 1994 because at that time, they were all busy with the packages sent by his wife and finished arranging the same by midnight.\n\n\"Accused-appellant testified that the charges of rape against him were all instigated by his mother-in-law who wanted him to be separated from his family and anticipated that he would be mortgaging the lot that his wife bought once the latter leave for abroad. He further testified that he loves his children very much and he did not know of any other reason why he was accused of such crime.  (TSN, September 17, 1998, p. 2-16).\" [6]\nAppellant submits that the onus required of the prosecution to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence accorded to every accused, as well as the legal mandate that the guilt of the accused must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, has not properly been discharged by the prosecution. Specifically, appellant contends that the medical findings do not tally with the testimony of complainant relied on by the trial court.\n\nIn the defense brief, appellant stressed:\n\n\"Massachusette claimed that it was on December 30, 1994 when her grandmother allegedly noticed the 'yellowish stain' on her panty.  It was at this point that she told her grandmother that she was raped by her father.  Immediately the following day on December 31, 1994, she was subjected to a physical examination.  Contrary to Massachussette's allegation, no secretion of any kind or color was found in her vagina. This prompted the medical officer to conduct internal examination by inserting a finger into Massachussette's vagina.  It was found that there were some old lacerations therein, however, during cross examination, such laxities in the vagina of Massachusette may have been due to the fact that she has been a physically active child, having engaged herself into various sports. The medical officer even admitted that independently of the insertion of a blunt instrument, her physical activities could have caused the laxity.\n\n\"While we adhere to the postulate that findings of the trial court are accorded great respect on the matter of the credibility of witnesses, it is our view that this case cannot come under said rule as the lower court misapplied some facts of weight and substance which, if only taken into account would have altered the result of the instant case.  (People vs. Camay, 152 SCRA 401)\n\n\"Massachussette's testimony is hardly positive and convincing.  Her so-called `harrowing experience' might solicit and win the sympathy of this Court but [it] does not mean that she could be telling the truth, especially when the records revealed that her grandmother and accused-appellant herein had a fight over a parcel of land.  Be it noted that it was Massachussette's grandmother who allegedly noticed the `stain' in her underwear which proved to be non-existent as no secretion was found in her vagina during the physical examination.\" [7]\nThe Solicitor General, on his part, seconds the findings of the court a quo; he states:\n\n\"Private complainant, Massachusette Navarette filed a complaint for rape against her father, the accused, Romeo Navarette, for having molested her on three occasions, particularly on June 11, sometime in October, and December 5 of 1994 when she was about to be ten years having been born on September 29, 1984 as evidenced by her Certificate of Birth marked as Exh. 'A'.\n\n\"That the first incident happened on June 11, 1994 at Bonfal Proper, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya when at night, while Massachusette and her younger brother, Romeo, Jr., were asleep, Massachusette was awaken by the fact that the accused, who was only wearing an underwear, was on top of her.  As she tried to fight, the accused held her hands upwards and spread her legs apart. Amidst her silent cries, her duster was put up and her panty was removed. And when the accused removed his underwear and did a pumping motion, which lasted for a few minutes, Massachusette felt pain in her vagina.  After satisfying his bestial lust, accused warned her not to tell the incident to anybody.  As she was afraid of her father for his cruelty, she did not report what happened.  In October and on December 5, under the same circumstances, the incident was again repeated.\n\n\"It was only sometime on December 30, 1994, when Massachusette and her younger brother stayed with their grandmother, Primitiva Aggabao, during the Christmas vacation, that she first reported the incident.  It so happened that the grandmother noticed the yellowish stain in her panty.  Out of suspicion, Mrs. Aggabao asked Massachusette to spread her legs and there she saw that the lower portion of her labia majora had been slashed.  When asked what it was all about, Massachusette confessed that she was raped by her father.  On the following day, Mrs. Aggabao accompanied her granddaughter to the hospital for physical examination.\n\n\"The medical and physical examination to which Massachusette underwent on December 31, 1994, as contained in the Medico-Legal Certification (Exhs. 'E', 'E-1' and 'E-2') issued by Dra. Marietta Anne Balbas, the attending physician, showed the following findings:\n\n-    menarche - (-)\n-    conscious, coherent, ambulatory, not in CR distress\n-    skin - no sign of physical injury\n-    Genitalia: External: Well-coaptated labia majora\nIE: Vagina, admits 1 finger with ease\nHymen: (+) old, healed lacerations\n(-) secretions\n\n\"Based on such findings, it appeared that the genitalia of the patient in its external findings has a well-coaptated labia majora which means that they were intact.  However, in the internal examination of the vagina, it admits one finger with ease which is not usual, generally, for a ten-year old girl and such laxity of the vaginal mucosa could have been caused by the insertion of any blunt object or material, which may include a male organ, or involvement in strenuous physical activities.  Likewise, the hymenal opening showed multiple old lacerations which could have been caused a few weeks, months or years back.  There were negative secretions.\n\n\"Aprilyn Navarette, Massachusette's mother, who was then in Hongkong, was informed of the incident and immediately came home.  As she was to leave again, it was Mrs. Aggabao who assisted Massachusette in filing the complaints before the police in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.  Three months after Aprilyn left, she died of cardio-respiratory arrest due to acute renal failure.  The fact that Massachusette was raped and the untimely demise of Aprilyn caused hurt feelings to Mrs. Aggabao and since then became indifferent to the accused.  Having found out about the complaints, the accused scolded and whipped Massachusette asking her what she had been telling to her grandmother.  This made Massachusette very angry and felt extreme dislike to his father and since then had been staying with her grandmother. During the incarceration of the accused, the latter wrote a letter (Exhs. `H' and `H-1') to them asking for forgiveness. [8]\nThe Court, in carefully examining the records and reviewing the case has kept in mind the guiding principles in the evaluation of rape cases, i.e., that -\n\n\"x x x (a) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove it but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (b) in view of the nature of the crime in which only two persons are involved, the testimony of complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.\" [9]\nIn assailing the credibility of the complainant, appellant would call attention to the fact that the medical finding of Dr. Marietta Ann B. Balbas found no secretion in complainant's vagina.  The yellowish substance, he argued, could have very well been there for a variety of causes or reasons.  But the medical examination was conducted a day after the stain found in the victim's panty was discovered.  At all events, the presence of either injury or secretions in the victim's genitalia would be unessential in the commission of, or a conviction [10] for, rape. The testimony alone of a victim of rape, if credible, is sufficient to convict an accused for such a crime. [11]\n\nThe complainant testified categorically and in great detail that she was raped by her father, viz:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q | Before June where does your father usually sleeps Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | He sleeps with us, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Before you sleep on the night of June 11, 1994 what did you do with the main entrance door of your house Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | It was locked, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Does it have a key?\n | \n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Who holds this key?\n | \n\"A | My father, sir.\n | \n\"Q | What happened after you slept on June 11, 1994 Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | I was raped by my father, sir.\n | \n\"Q | Where was your brother, Romeo Navarette, Jr. when you slept Madam Witness?\n | \n\"A | He was beside me, sir.\n | \n\"Q | You said your father raped you Madam Witness, what was your bedroom attire on the night of June 11, 1994?\n | \n\"A | I was in a house dress, sir.

GUILBERT:\nI am trying to refresh your mind.\n\"COURT: Precisely, she cannot remember, why do you insist?\" [13] The trial court has found the complainant's testimony to be straightforward and credible. [14] The assignment of values to the testimony of witnesses is virtually left to the trial court and its conclusion on the matter of credibility of witnesses is accorded great weight and respect, [15] it being in a good position to assess these matters. [16]\n\nThe insinuation made by appellant that the filing of rape charges against him had been motivated by the victim's grandmother with whom appellant allegedly had a misunderstanding over a piece of land was debunked by the former who, on cross-examination, said that prior to the rape incidents she never disliked nor resented her son-in-law.  As the trial court so objectively explained - \"It is likewise highly improbable that the imputation of so grave a crime such as rape could have been motivated by a mere misunderstanding between the accused and her mother-in-law over a parcel of land as the accused would like to impress.  No grandmother would be so apathetic to instigate her 10-year old granddaughter to file a rape case against her own father simply on account of her alleged interest over a residential lot.  The plain denial and uncorroborated testimony of the accused cannot prevail over the affirmative testimonies of prosecution witnesses not only by reason of its inherent weakness but for its being simply without substantive merit.\" [17] It might not be amiss to state that appellant even sent letters to his mother-in-law, Primitiva Aggabao, while he was in detention, asking for forgiveness and begging for the withdrawal of the criminal complaints against him. [18]\n\nRegrettably, the Court, in sum, cannot sustain the urgings of appellant. The facts narrated by the trial court in its decision are amply sustained by the transcript of stenographic notes, the exhibits and records forwarded to this Court.\n\nArticle 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, in part, provides: \"ART. 335. When and how rape is committed. Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.\"\n\nxxx             xxx         xxx\n\n\"The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:\n\n\"1. when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree. or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.\" The minority of the victim and her relationship with her father, herein appellant, have both been alleged in the information.  These qualifying circumstances have been testified to and attested by the Certificate of Birth [19] of \"Massachusette Navarette,\" herein complainant, issued by the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya, indicating her date of birth, 29 September 1984, and her filiation to appellant.  This official document has been formally offered and properly marked during the hearing of 20 August 1998.  The trial court has thus aptly imposed the penalty of DEATH for each of the crimes committed.\n\nIn line with prevailing jurisprudence, the award of P50,000.00 civil liability ex delicto must be increased to P75,000.00, the standard amount awarded to the offended party when rape is effectively qualified under Republic Act No. 7659. [20] The award of P25,000.00 exemplary damages is warranted and in line with our pronouncement in People vs. Catubig [21] just recently decided. [22] In addition and conformably with prevailing jurisprudence, the Court likewise awards the amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages to the victim. [23]\n\nWHEREFORE , judgment is hereby rendered AFFIRMING the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 28 in Criminal Cases No. 2901, No. 2902 and No. 2903 finding accused-appellant Romeo Navarette y Aquino guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape on 3 counts, and imposing upon him the penalty of death in each of the three cases.  Appellant is likewise ordered to indemnify the victim, Massachusette Navarette the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages also in each of the three cases, or a grand total of P450,000.00.\n\nUnder Republic Act No. 7659, when, by reason or on the occasion of the rape, homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death. [24] Four Justices of the Supreme Court maintain their position that the law, insofar as it prescribes the death penalty, is unconstitutional; nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty could thereby be imposed.In accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of the pardoning power.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr., and Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ., concur.\nPuno, J., on official leave.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 10.\n\n[2] Rollo, p. 12.\n\n[3] Rollo, p. 14.\n\n[4] Rollo, p. 56.\n\n[5] Rollo, p. 43.\n\n[6] Rollo, pp. 42-43.\n\n[7] Rollo, pp. 46-47.\n\n[8] Rollo, pp. 29-30.\n\n[9] People vs. Manggasin, 306 SCRA 228, 239.\n\n[10] People vs. Zaballero, 274 SCRA 627.\n\n[11] People vs. Cura, 240 SCRA 234.\n\n[12] TSN, 14 January 1998, pp. 8-20.\n\n[13] TSN, 18 February 1998, pp. 2-7.\n\n[14] People vs. Guamos, 241 SCRA 528.\n\n[15] People vs. Cura, 240 SCRA 234.\n\n[16] People vs. de Roxas, 241 SCRA 369.\n\n[17] Rollo, pp. 32-33.\n\n[18] See People vs. Garcia, 281 SCRA 463.\n\n[19] Records, p. 100.\n\n[20] People vs. Victor, 292 SCRA 186; People vs. Flores, 311 SCRA 170.\n\n[21] G.R.
