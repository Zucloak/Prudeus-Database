I am a Filipino, native of the town of Santa Maria, Bulacan, 19 years of age, married, a farmer, and live in the barrio of Halang of the town of Santa Maria. I swear before First Lieut. Chas. E.

This sentence was justified by the facts adduced in the case and the judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed and the said defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for the term of twenty years and to pay the costs of his suit.\n\nArellano, C.
