SENDIN, MTC, SOLANO, NUEVA VIZCAYA.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nPARDO, J.:\n\nThis involves an audit by the Office of the Court Administrator on the books of accounts of Clerk of Court Pacita T. Sendin, Municipal Trial Court, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya.\n\nOn July 19, 2000, Mrs. Sendin compulsorily retired from the service.  Thus, she submitted her cashbooks and other related documents for clearance purposes.  She was in charge of judiciary funds for the period covering March 1985 to July 15, 2000.\n\nOn March 28, 2001, the Office of the Clerk of Court submitted a memorandum indicating that based on the computation presented to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, their audit revealed that there was delay in the remittances of funds collection.\n\nThe computation is as follows:\nFOR THE JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nTotal collections for theperiod  from  March1985 to July 15, 2000 | | P  305,203.20\nLess: Remittance made-March 1985 to July 15, 2000 | | 253,614.20\n[END_TABLE]\n\nTotal collections for the\nperiod  from  March\n1985 to July 15, 2000\nP  305,203.20 Less: Remittance made-\nMarch 1985 to July 15, 2000 253,614.20 Unremitted Collections as\nOf July 15, 2000 51,589.00 Less: Remittances made on\nJanuary 25, 2001\nReplacement of stale\nPMO deposited on12/14/2000 P  49,725.00 1,864.00 51,589.00 Accountability after\nJanuary 25,2001 P              -0-\n=========\nFOR GENERAL FUND:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nTotal Collections for the period | \nfrom September 1995 toJuly 15, 2000 | P 99, 751.85\nLess: Remittances made – | \nSeptember 1999 to July15, 2000 (representinginterest earned ondeposits ofFiduciary Fund) | 17,866.65\nUnremitted Collections as ofJuly 15, 2000 | P 81,885.20\nLess: Remittances made –January 25, 2001 | 81,885.20\nAccountability afterJanuary 25, 2001 | P             -0-\n[END_TABLE]\n\nTotal Collections for the period\nfrom September 1995 to\nJuly 15, 2000 P 99, 751.85 Less: Remittances made –\n\nSeptember 1999 to July\n15, 2000 (representing\ninterest earned on\ndeposits of\nFiduciary Fund) 17,866.65 Unremitted Collections as of\nJuly 15, 2000 P 81,885.20 Less: Remittances made –\nJanuary 25, 2001 81,885.20 Accountability after\nJanuary 25, 2001 P             -0-\nFOR THE FIDUCIARY FUND:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nBeginning Balance(collections directlydeposited with theMTO) | | P   159,150.00\nAdd: Total collections forthe period from April1995 to July 15, 2000 | | 1,011,650.00\nTotal Collections | | P 1,170,650.00\nLess: Withdrawals madefor the same period | | 521,400.00\nBalance of UnwithdrawnFiduciary Fund as of15, 2000 | | P    649,250.00\nLess: LBP Balance as ofJuly 15, 2000 underSavings Account No. | P     317,901.44 | \n0721345 MTOBalance per | | 477,051.44\nCertification issued | 159,150.00 | \nShortage as of July 15, 2000 | | 172,198.85\nLess: Remittances made on | | 172,198.85\nJanuary 25, 2001January 26, 2001January 29, 2001\nAccountability afterJanuary 29, 2001 | | P           .29\n[END_TABLE]\n\nBeginning Balance\n(collections directly\ndeposited with the\nMTO)\n\nP   159,150.00 Add: Total collections for\nthe period from April\n1995 to July 15, 2000 1,011,650.00 Total Collections P 1,170,650.00 Less: Withdrawals made\nfor the same period 521,400.00 Balance of Unwithdrawn\nFiduciary Fund as of\n15, 2000 P    649,250.00 Less: LBP Balance as of\nJuly 15, 2000 under\nSavings Account No. P     317,901.44\n0721345 MTO\nBalance per\n477,051.44 Certification issued\n159,150.00\nShortage as of July 15, 2000\n172,198.85 Less: Remittances made on\n\n172,198.85 January 25, 2001\nJanuary 26, 2001\nJanuary 29, 2001 Accountability after\nJanuary 29, 2001 P           .29 The result of the audit shows that Mrs. Sendin incurred a total shortage of three hundred three thousand eight hundred nine pesos and five centavos (P 303,809.05).\n\nMrs. Sendin restituted the amounts on separate dates in January of 2001. Nevertheless, the non-remittance on time of said amounts deprived the Court of the interest that may be earned if  the amounts were deposited in a bank, as prudently required.\n\nMrs. Sendin, as the Clerk of Court, had the duty to remit the collections within a prescribed period. [1] Shortages in the amounts to be remitted and the years of delay in the actual remittance constitute neglect of duty for which she shall be administratively liable.\n\nIt is the clerk of court’s duty to faithfully perform her duties and responsibilities as such “to the end that there was full compliance with circulars on deposits of collections.” [2]\n\nIndeed, clerks of court with regard to the collection of legal fees, perform a delicate function as judicial officers entrusted with the correct and effective implementation of regulations thereon.\n\nIn Report On The Financial Audit Conducted On The Books Of Accounts Of OIC Melinda Deseo, MTC, General Trias, Cavite , [3] we said that the undue delay, in the remittances of amounts collected by clerks of court at the very least constitutes misfeasance.\n\nAs a public servant, Mrs. Sendin must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity. Her failure to properly remit the fund collections transgressed the trust reposed in her as an officer of the court. [4]\n\nHowever, since Mrs. Sendin had retired from the service, with forty-six (46) years of service to the court, and she restituted the amounts although belatedly, we find it proper to impose  a fine on her.\n\nWHEREFORE, we IMPOSE on Pacita T. Sendin a fine in the amount of five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) to be deducted from her retirement benefits.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan , and Ynares-Santiago, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Administrative Circular 5-93 states:\n“3. Duty of the Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge or accountable officers. -  The Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, or their accountable duly authorized representatives designated by them in writing, who must be accountable officers, shall receive the Judiciary Development Fund collections, issue the proper receipt therefore, maintain a separate cash book properly marked CASH BOOK FOR JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND, deposit such collections in the manner herein prescribed, and render the proper monthly report of collections for said fund.
