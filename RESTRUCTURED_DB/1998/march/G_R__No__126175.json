GERARDO MOLAS Y CERDENA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nROMERO, J.:\n\nThe pervasiveness\nand escalating incidence of sexual crime in our society nowadays is a\nphenomenon that arouses the highest degree of revulsion in all but the most\ninsensitive. What is even more\ndisgusting is when the victim is a minor barely out of childhood and the\noffender is a virtual member of the family living under the same roof. For here there is rank betrayal of trust and\nconfidence. Our numerous pronouncements\ndenouncing what is now categorized as a âheinous crimeâ do not seem to have\nmade an impact on those who give unfettered rein to their bestial\ninstincts. The instant case eloquently\nshows that the possible dire consequences on their dastardly acts never cross\nthe minds of those who are bent on violating the virginity and purity of young\ngirls such as the accused-appellant.\n\nAppellant\nGerardo Molas y CerdeÃ±a was charged with three (3) counts of rape before the\nRegional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 93 [1] in a complaint dated December 3,\n1985 which reads as follows: âI. Criminal Case No. Q-43220 The undersigned accuses GERARDO MOLAS Y CERDEÃA of the crime of RAPE,\ncommitted as follows: That on or about the 12th day of\nJuly, 1985, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this\nHonorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of\nforce and intimidation, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously, succeed in having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, below 12\nyears old, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and\nprejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the\nprovisions of the Civil Code. CONTRARY TO LAW. Quezon City, Philippines, November\n27, 1985. II. Criminal Case No. Q-43221 The undersigned accuses GERARDO\nMOLAS Y CERDEÃA of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows: That on or about the 19th day of\nJuly, 1985, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this\nHonorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of\nforce and intimidation, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously, succeed in having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, below 12\nyears old, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and\nprejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the\nprovisions of the Civil Code. CONTRARY TO LAW. Quezon City, Philippines, November\n27, 1985. III. Criminal Case No. Q-43222 The undersigned accuses GERARDO\nMOLAS Y CERDEÃA of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows: That on or about the 22nd day of\nNovember, 1985, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this\nHonorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of\nforce and intimidation, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and\nfeloniously, succeed in having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, a minor\nbelow 12 years old, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and\nprejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the\nprovisions of the Civil Code. CONTRARY TO LAW. Quezon City, Philippines, November\n27, 1985.â\n\nUpon\narraignment, appellant entered a plea of not guilty, after which trial on the\nmerits ensued.\n\nThe\nprosecutionâs version of the commission of the crime, narrated through its\nwitness, complainant Lealyne Simangan, reveals the following facts:\n\nComplainant,\nborn on July 5, 1978, was the daughter of the spouses Alejandro G. Simangan and\nErlinda M. Simangan. The Simangans and\nthe appellant, who is the half-brother of complainantâs mother, all resided\nunder the same roof.\n\nUpon attaining\nthe age of seven (7) years, complainant was subjected to sexual abuse by the\nappellant who was her step uncle. The\nattack on her virtue started on July 12, 1985. On that day, while the complainant was alone watching television, the\nappellant suddenly emerged and started to make sexual advances on her. To consummate his bestial desire, the\nappellant undressed the complainant and succeeded in having his carnal desire\nsated.\n\nBarely a week\nafter the first incident or on July 19, 1985, appellant again molested the\ncomplainant. Under the same\ncircumstances, he undressed the complainant and made her lie down on the floor\nand thereafter forcibly mounted her to satisfy his lust. As in the first incident, complainant did\nnot reveal her traumatic ordeal to her parents for fear of being scolded.\n\nFour months\nlater or on November 22, 1985, appellant saw the complainant playing with her\nyounger sister inside their house. Ostensibly, and as a means to fulfill his seemingly insatiable desire, he\nasked the complainantâs younger sister to run some errands. Convinced that the sister had left,\nappellant undressed the complainant and made her lie down. Thereafter, as in the first two instances,\nhe mounted the complainant and was able to have coitus with her. Appellant, however, did not realize that the\ncomplainantâs sister witnessed the sexual congress and immediately narrated the\nincident to their mother.\n\nIn his defense,\nthe appellant merely denied the accusations against him claiming that it was not possible for him to\ncommit the crime, since his house was far from the complainantâs\nresidence. Moreover, he insinuates that\nthe injuries on the private parts of the complainant must have come about as a\nresult of her falling from a stairway and hitting a hard object. Likewise, the appellant asserts that the\nfiling of the complaints was due to ill-will by the complainantâs family\nagainst him.\n\nAfter trial, the\nlower court rendered judgment [2] acquitting the appellant in\nCriminal Case No. Q-43220 and Q-43221 for insufficiency of evidence. However, it convicted the appellant in\nCriminal Case No. Q-43222, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: âWHEREFORE, the Court holds, that\nthe prosecution has established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable\ndoubt in Criminal Case No. Q-43222 for RAPE, and therefore, sentences Gerardo\nMolas y CerdeÃ±a, to Reclusion Perpetua, and to pay the costs. He is likewise ordered to indemnify\nthe offended girl in the sum of P 30,000.00 without subsidiary\nimprisonment, in case of insolvency. SO ORDERED.â\n\nFrom the\nforegoing conviction, appellant is now before us insisting on his\ninnocence. First , he harps on\nthe failure of the trial court to consider Exhibit 1 and 1-A, a certification\ndated November 4, 1986 issued by one Dr. Romeo E. Ariola, attesting that the\ncomplainant was taken to V. Luna General Hospital on March 22, 1985 for\ntreatment of her private parts resulting from her accidental fall from the\nstairs. Second , the rape charges\nagainst him were merely fabricated by the complainantâs family because of a\nprevious misunderstanding.\n\nThe defense must\nfail as we are not impressed with appellantâs protestations.\n\nIt has always\nbeen our consistent ruling that when there are conflicting versions of the\nprosecution and the defense, the averments of the trial court are generally\nviewed as correct and entitled to great weight [3] except when the trial court has\noverlooked certain facts which, if considered, could affect the result of the\ncase. [4] Appellant, however, has not\npresented any substantial argument, much less convincing material evidence, to\nbuttress his defense which could have been overlooked by the trial court to\njustify a reversal of its conclusion.\n\nViewed in this\nlight, the contention that the trial court did not consider Exhibits 1 and 1-A\noffered by the appellant is a misleading argument. A review of the record would reveal that the trial court did\nadmit the said Exhibits in a ruling dated February 8, 1989. [5]\n\nGranting that\nExhibits 1 and 1-A were indeed erroneously excluded by the trial court, the\nsame were of little consequence for it is immaterial to the instant case. We note that the said Exhibits were\ncertifications to the effect that the complainant was treated for injuries on\nher private parts resulting from an accident sometime in March 1985. However, the rape took place on November 22,\n1985 or eight (8) months after the accident; therefore, the vaginal bleeding\ndiscovered when the medical examination was conducted on the complainant on November\n23, 1985 could not have been the result of the supposed accident.\n\nIn fact, the\nmedical report [6] dated November 23, 1985, stated\nthat the bleeding could have occurred only within the past 24 or 48 hours. This finding was supported by the testimony of the examining\nphysician, Dr. Desiderio A. Moraleda. [7] Evidently, appellantâs assertion\nthat the vaginal bleeding was due to the complainantâs fall from the stairs,\nwhich happened eight (8) months prior to the commission of the crime, is\nutterly false.\n\nIn a desperate\nand futile attempt to escape liability, appellant claims that the complainantâs\nfamily merely concocted the rape charge against him.\n\nThe contention\nis far from persuasive. We have ruled\nthat a young girlâs revelation that she has been raped, coupled with her\nvoluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public\ntrial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her\ndignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction. [8]\n\nConsidering the\nage of the complainant, who was seven years old when the crime was committed,\nit would be improbable for a girl of her age to fabricate a charge so\nhumiliating to herself and her family had she not been truly subjected to the\npainful experience of sexual abuse. [9]\n\nIn the case at\nbar, the complainant definitely does not have the gift of articulation and\ninventiveness; hence, it is not possible for her to have fabricated the charges\nagainst the appellant. Assuming that\nshe was indeed tutored on what to say on the witness stand, it is worthy to\nnote that when she testified, she was alone; hence, any traces of inconsistency\nwould have easily been detected. More importantly, the complainant took the\nwitness stand six times to narrate her harrowing experience, and in all of\nthose instances, she underwent intensive cross-examination from the defense [10] but her testimony never wavered nor\nfaltered.\n\nIn other words,\nit is most improbable that a girl of tender years, innocent and guileless,\nwould brazenly impute a crime so serious as rape to any man, if it were not\ntrue. [11] Certainly, complainantâs testimony\ndeserves utmost respect and credence.\n\nIn fine, there\nis not an iota of doubt in our mind that appellant is guilty of the crime\ncharged, hence, we affirm his conviction. Inasmuch as banishment to Hades is not one of the penalties sanctioned\nby law, we shall just increase the indemnity from P 30,000.00 to P 50,000.00\nconsistent with prevailing jurisprudence. [12]\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the\ndecision of the trial court dated February 20, 1989 in Criminal Case No.\nQ-43222 is hereby AFFIRMED, subject to the MODIFICATION that appellant\nindemnify the complainant in the amount of P 50,000.00.
