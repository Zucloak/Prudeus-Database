D E C I S I O N PUNO, J.: This special civil action for certiorari seeks to annul two (2) resolutions[1] of public respondent NLRC (Third Division) awarding US$27,902.02 to the private respondent for the death of her husband and 10% of said amount as attorney's fees.The facts and the issues are accurately stated in the February 11, 1997 Resolution of the public respondent which we quote:\"The bare facts culled from the record show that Eduardo O. Felipe was married to the complainant and the union produced a child, Michelle F. Felipe.\"Eduardo O. Felipe was hired by Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd., through its local agent Omanfil International Manpower Development Corporation, as Offshore Rigger sometime on February 7, 1993.\"On or about June 7, 1993, the ferry boat where Eduardo Felipe was on board met an accident, claiming the life of one worker but the body of Eduardo Felipe was never found, despite diligent efforts to locate the same.\"Complainant received from the Melaka Labor Office a certification which reads as follows:'Sir,'SUB : DECEASED - EDUARDO O. FELIPEon 7.6.93'With reference the money should be paid accordingly to Section 8 of Labour Malaysia, 1952 as follows:-Income in a month RM1,655.52 (US620.04)Interest RM -Medical RM -Food RM - (or RM105/90/70 which ever more)Total claim RM1,655 x 45 month = RM74,498.40 (or RM14,400 which ever less) = US27,902.02'If you agreed [sic] to the above calculation please pay the money RM14,400 (US5,393.29) to PBN/PPB to the next of kin of the deceased.'Enclosed please find the following form [sic] to fill.a) 1 copy Form 'A' - Buruh 32b) 3 copy [sic] Agreed Memorandum. Pleaseempty for the signature of the deceased next of kin.'Please return all the form [sic] together with the claim and stamp \"Hasil\" RM2.70 (US1.011) within 30 days from the date of this letter.'Thank you.'Yours faithfully,'\"Likewise, the Melaka Labor Office issued a receipt showing that Hyundai Engineering deposited RM14,400.00 with the Melaka Labor Office.\"The fact of death of Eduardo O. Felipe was not raised as an issue in this Office inasmuch as the same was admitted in respondents' pleadings.\"Thus, the issue raised before the Labor Arbiter is the amount of death benefits due the complainant and whether the deposit made by Hyundai with the Melaka Labor Office constitutes valid payment.\"Complainant alleges that the amount should be US$27,902.02 and that the deposit made by Hyundai Engineering to the Melaka Labor Office did not constitute payment.\"On the other hand, respondents contend that the complainant is only entitled to RM14,400.00 or US$5,393.29 and that their deposit of the said amount with the Melaka Labor Office extinguished their obligation.\"The Labor Arbiter ordered petitioner to pay private respondent US$27,902.02 as death benefit and 10% thereof as attorney's fees.[2]The public respondent NLRC (Third Division) affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter.[3] It held:x x x\"The core of the matter in the case at bar is the interpretation of the certification issued by the Labor Office of Melaka and the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law of Malaysia.\"The Certification of the Melaka Labor Office reads as follows:'Sir,'SUB : DECEASED - EDUARDO O. FELIPEon 7.6.93'With reference the money should be paid accordingly to Section 8 of Labour Malaysia, 1952 as follows:-Income in a month RM1,655.52 (US620.04)Interest RM -Medical RM -Food RM - (or RM105/90/70 which ever more)Total claim RM1,655 x 45 month = RM74,498.40 (or RM14,400 which ever less) = US27,902.02'If you agreed [sic] to the above calculation please pay the money RM14,400 (US5,393.29) to PBN/PPB to the next of kin of the deceased.'Enclosed please find the following form [sic] to fill.a) 1 copy Form 'A' - Buruh 32b) 3 copy [sic] Agreed Memorandum. Please empty for the signature of the deceased next of kin.'Please return all the form [sic] together with the claim and stamp \"Hasil\" RM2.70 (US1.011) within 30 days from the date of this letter.'Thank you.'Yours faithfully,'\"On the other hand, Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Malaysia, reads as follows:'Where death has resulted from the injury, a lump sum equal to forty five months earnings or fourteen thousand four hundred ringgit, whichever is the less;'\"A perusal of the foregoing certification and provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Malaysia, as correctly pointed out by the complainant, are [sic] susceptible of two different interpretations.\"The Certification is indeed ambiguous inasmuch as it goes to the extent of computing the death benefits based on forty five months of the deceased monthly earnings and at the same time adds the phrase `RM14,400.00, whichever less'. The ambiguity becomes more apparent by virtue of the figure US$27,902.02 which appears below the phrase `which ever less'. If the intention of the Labor Office of Melaka was to award RM14,400.00 it should have not otherwise put the amount of US$27,902.02.\"In ruling in favor of complainant, we but render obedience to the well-entrenched principle that in case of doubt, a labor case must be decided in favor of the workingman. (Aquino et al. vs. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 8763, February 11, 1992). This is in consonance with the liberal and compassionate spirit which gave birth to labor laws as social justice measures and as manifestation of the State's avowed policy to give maximum aid and protection to labor (see Sarmiento vs. Employees Compensation Commission, 103 SCRA 329).\"On the second and third issues, we also rule in favor of complainant. Although, there was deposited of [sic] RM14,400.00 with the Melaka Labor Office, the same is not valid.\"We do not agree with respondents' contention that they had no option but to pay directly to the Melaka Labor Office. It is clear from the same certification that respondents were given the option to pay the compensation benefits to `PNB/PPB to the next of kin of the deceased.' Therefore, respondents should have paid directly to herein complainant, she being the next of kin of the deceased. Furthermore, under Philippine laws, payment to the next of kin of the deceased is valid. Finally, as again correctly pointed out by complainant, the amount deposited with the Melaka Labor Office is less than the amount to which complainant is entitled, so much so that the deposit of the same is not the complete payment needed to extinguish respondents' obligation.\"Petitioner charges the public respondent with grave abuse of discretion and submits the following issues for resolution:First. Whether or not the public respondent seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in affirming the decision of the Honorable Labor Arbiter finding that the benefits due the private respondent was US$27,902.02.Second. Whether or not the public respondent seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in holding that the Certification/Computation marked as Annex \"F\" above and Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Malaysia were susceptible to two different interpretations and thereafter applied the rule that in case of doubt, settle the doubt in favor of labor.Third. Whether or not the public respondent seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in disregarding the express language of Annexes \"I\", \"I-1\", \"I-2\", \"I-3\", and \"I-4\".Fourth. Whether or not the public respondent seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion when it affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter finding that the deposit of RM14,400 was not a valid payment.We find the petition meritorious.First. We hold that there is no ambiguity in the aforequoted Computation/Certification from the Malacca Labor Office. The computation is in complete accord with Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Malaysia which states:x x x\"8. Subject to this Act, the amount of compensation shall be as follows, namely -a. Where death has resulted from the injury, a lump sum equal to forty-five months' earnings or fourteen thousand four hundred ringgit, whichever is less.\"Clearly what is due to the private respondent as death benefit is 14,400 Malaysian Ringgit since that amount is less than US $27,902.02.Second. To clinch its contention that private respondent is only entitled to the payment of RM14,400, petitioner also submitted the following Certification issued by Sh. Yahya Bin Sh. Mohamed, Director General of Labour Peninsular, Malaysia:[4]\"IBU PEJABAT JABATAN BURUH, SEMENANJUNG MALAYSIA (KEMENTERIAN SUMBER MANUSIA),PARAS 5, BLOK B (UTARA), Telefon: 03-2557200PUSAT BANDAR DAMANSARA, 03-255911150532 KUALA LUMPUR Telefax : 03-2536040--------------------------------------------------------------------------Ruj Tuan :Ruj Kami : (8)BSM.9/12/46/96Tarikh: /( Mac 1997To Whom It May Concern.Fatal Accident to Eduardo O.
