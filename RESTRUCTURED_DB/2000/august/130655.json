  "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LEO MACALIAG, JESSE TORRE AND JULIVER CHUA, ACCUSED. JESSE TORRE AND JULIVER CHUA, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS. D E C I S I O N YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.: This is an appeal from the decision dated June 19, 1997 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 2 of Iligan City in Criminal Case No. 5923, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, and in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered finding all the accuseds (sic) namely: Leo Macaliag, Jesse Torre, a.k.a. âSasotâ and Juliver Chua, a.k.a. âBotyokâ, guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals of the crime of murder as the same is defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing each and every accused to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua with all the accessory penalties provided for under the law as well as to pay the cost. They are furthermore ordered to pay the heirs of the deceased, jointly and severally, the sum of P50,000.00 as and for the death of deceased Brian Jalani and further the sum of P20,000.00 as and for moral damages. SO ORDERED.[1] This case originated from the information filed against accused-appellants Jesse Torre, a.k.a. âSasotâ and Juliver Chua, a.k.a. âBotyokâ, along with co-accused Leo Macaliag which alleged: That on or about April 16, 1995, in the City of Iligan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other, armed with a deadly weapon, by means of treachery and evident premeditation, and with intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab and wound one Brian Jalani, thereby inflicting upon him the following physical injuries, to wit: - Cardio Respiratory Arrest - Hypovolemic Shock, R shoulder R Infrascapular area, L Lumbar all penetrating which caused his death. Contrary to and in violation of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code with the aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation.[2] The prosecution relied, for the most part, on the testimony of eyewitness Anacleto Moste who related in open court the relevant incidents of that fateful night of April 16, 1995. According to him, he was then watching a political rally at Purok Rosal, Villaverde, Iligan City on or about 9:30 oâclock in the evening when he heard a certain David, who was in a state of panic, asking for help because someone was being stabbed near Baslayan Creek, not too distant from where the rally was taking place. When he arrived at the scene, he saw three (3) men attacking a lone victim. He was able to recognize the three (3) accused as the perpetrators, as well as the hapless victim, one Brian Jalani, for they were all personally known to him. There was adequate lighting coming from a nearby lamp post, and witness Moste was only a mere eight (8) to ten (10) meters away from them. Furthermore, there were no obstructions to his line of vision. In describing the positions of the accused relative to the victim, witness Moste testified that accused Torre was holding the neck of victim Jalani from the latterâs back, while the other two accused, Chua and Macaliag, were to the victimâs right and left, taking turns in stabbing him. He shouted at the perpetrators three (3) times before accused Torre pushed the victim into the creek, after which all the three (3) accused fled towards the direction of Purok Gumamela. Moste was about to chase them, but decided against it when he heard the cries of the victim who was sinking into the mud and gasping for breath, at the same time bleeding profusely from his stab wounds. Moste tried to solicit the aid of some onlookers, shouting for help, as he himself started to drown in the mud while striving to keep victim Jalani from sinking. Finally, three workers from Dado Lechon took pity and pulled Moste and Jalani out of the muddy creek. After some difficulty in securing a vehicle, the victim was finally brought to the Dr. Uy Hospital for treatment, but he (Jalani) succumbed to death shortly thereafter. By then, witness Moste had already left the hospital to notify Jalaniâs mother and to report the incident to one SPO4 Lubang, who happened to be Mosteâs neighbor.[3] The prosecution also presented Dr. Livey Villarin to identify the necropsy report. The doctor testified that the victim sustained six (6) stab wounds in all: three (3) in front and three (3) at his back; the most fatal of which was the one on the victimâs chest.[4] The final witness for the prosecution was SPO4 Antonio Lubang who was, at the time of the incident, the Assistant Chief of the Special Investigating Unit of Precinct 4 of the Iligan City Police Command. He testified that at 1:00 oâclock in the early morning of April 17, 1995, he was awakened by witness Moste and a certain Rene Alasagas who reported the stabbing incident involving the victim Brian Jalani and the three accused. He further averred that upon investigation, other witnesses positively identified Macaliag as one of the perpetrators. He was also able to interview one Jeffrey Yorong who stated that had he not been able to escape, he would have been the first victim of the same perpetrators that night.[5] There were no immediate arrests since all three accused had fled the vicinity. It was only on February 1, 1996 or almost ten (10) months later that accused Juliver Chua was apprehended. The other two accused, Leo Macaliag and Jesse Torre, were brought under the jurisdiction of the trial court some four (4) months thereafter. Upon their arraignment, all three accused pleaded not guilty, interposing the defense of alibi. For his part, accused Juliver Chua argued that he could not have been in the vicinity of the crime because he was then dancing at a disco in Tambacan, Iligan City; that he only returned to Villaverde, Iligan City in the early hours of the morning of April 17, 1995; that he even met prosecution witness Moste along the way, where the latter allegedly asked him (Chua) if he knew the whereabouts of Leo Macaliag and Jesse Torre. On cross-examination, accused Chua testified that on or about 1:10 in the morning, on his way home from the disco, he met co-accused Leo Macaliag and Jesse Torre at Aldo Arts and Signs, both of whom persuaded him to accompany them to Purok Manuang, Mahayahay, Iligan City. It was there where he first learned that Brian Jalani had been stabbed to death by Macaliag and Torre, allegedly with the participation of one Jun Tacastacas and Michael Pato, who were then having a drinking session. He decided to go home because he was afraid that he would be implicated in whatever crime Macaliag and the others had committed.[6] Accused Chuaâs alibi was corroborated by his girlfriend, Carla Garces. She testified that she was with Chua at the disco on the night of the incident and that they were together the whole time. They left the disco together at about 1:00 oâclock in the morning, parting ways at the traffic light at Quezon Avenue.[7] Next to testify on Chuaâs behalf was his mother Antonia Chua, who related that at 10:00 oâclock in the evening of April 16, 1995, she went to the disco to fetch her son, but she left him in the company of his girlfriend Carla Garces who agreed to accompany him home. The elder Chua further stated that her son arrived home at 1:30 oâclock in the morning of the following day.[8] On the part of accused Jesse Torre, his mother, Rosita Torre testified that at the time of the incident, Jesse was with her at their home, sleeping until the following morning because he had a fever. After he recovered from his illness, accused Torre left for Cagayan de Oro City, where he worked vending peanuts until he and co-accused Leo Macaliag were arrested in June of 1996.[9] Accused Jesse Torre reiterated that he was at home, sick with fever, on the night of the tragic incident. He denied knowing the victim, Brian Jalani, while averring that he met co-accused Chua for the first time when both were already incarcerated in the city jail. He also refuted earlier testimony that he and Macaliag were notoriously known as partners in crime, saying that they were mere acquaintances. And contrary to accused Chuaâs earlier allegation, Torre said he was not with the group of Macaliag, Tacastacas, Pato and Chua in Barrio Manuang, Mahayahay, Iligan City, in the early morning of April 17, 1995.[10] When it came time for accused Leo Macaliag to testify, he asserted that at the time of the incident, he was home drinking beer with his father. He only learned of the incident when accused Chua came knocking and asked if he (Chua) could hide in the Macaliag house for a while. He recalled that Chuaâs clothes were bloodied and covered with mud, prompting him to refuse Chuaâs request. Shortly thereafter, SPO4 Antonio Lubang and prosecution witness Moste arrived, asking the whereabouts of Leo Macaliagâs younger brother, Roel, who was then attending the political rally. He further averred that he stayed home for several weeks before moving to Cagayan de Oro City, where he also found a job selling peanuts until he was apprehended.[11] The last witness for the defense was one Estela Minister, a neighbor of accused Macaliag, who testified that at 11:00 oâclock in the evening of April 16, 1995, she was doing her laundry in front of her house. She corroborated Macaliagâs testimony that accused Juliver Chua came to the Macaliag residence, but Chua was harangued by Leoâs mother who scolded him (Chua) and denied him entry. That upon seeing Chuaâs dirty clothes and bloodied hands, she discontinued her washing, fearful that Chua would return.[12] After carefully evaluating all the conflicting testimonies and evidence adduced by the opposing parties, the Regional Trial Court rendered its decision finding all the accused guilty of the murder of Brian Jalani. Not satisfied with the decision rendered by the trial court, accused Jesse Torre and Juliver Chua filed the instant appeal. Accused-appellants contend that â I THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED EYEWITNESS. II THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF THE CRIME OF MURDER DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT AND IN NOT CONSIDERING THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS. III ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANTS INDEED KILLED THE VICTIM, THEN THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF MURDER INSTEAD OF THE LESSER OFFENSE OF HOMICIDE.[13] In support of the first and second assigned errors, the accused-appellants argued that while it is the rule that conclusions and findings of fact of the trial court are binding and are generally not disturbed on appeal, said rule is not without exception, such as when the trial court ignored and overlooked facts of such weight and influence which could alter the result if considered.[14] The appellants submit that their case is an exception to the general rule, for the trial court overlooked and ignored the fact that the testimony of the alleged eyewitness Anacleto Moste was patently incredible and sadly lacking in truth, candor and spontaneity.[15] In particular, the accused-appellants found it hard to believe that Moste, knowing that the assailants were supposedly âpolice charactersâ, could summon the courage to shout at them, and even contemplate running after them. To the accused-appellants, such a show of bravery runs counter to the ordinary course of human experience. Secondly, they pointed out that Mosteâs testimony did not agree with the medical findings that the victim sustained only six (6) stab wounds, which in their opinion was too few considering that some amount of time had elapsed since a certain David first witnessed the stabbing until Mosteâs arrival at the scene. Furthermore, Mosteâs testimony that there were no policemen or bodyguards during the political rally at Purok Rosal is not to be believed since it is public knowledge that there are always bodyguards or police escorts protecting the candidates during rallies. The accused-appellantsâ contentions are bereft of merit. The trial court based its judgment on the credible and overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution. Thus, we find no reason to disturb the conclusions or findings of fact of the trial court. First, the bravery, or even heroism, of eyewitness Moste should not be belittled by the appellantsâ apparent lack of faith in the inherent goodness of human beings. While it cannot be denied that not all men are heroes, neither are all men cowards. Besides, what was in Mosteâs testimony that was unbelievable? He admitted that his initial reaction was fear, but such fear did not paralyze him to inaction or apathy. Instead, the better and more compassionate part of his being drove him to perform a civic, if not moral duty. Eyewitness Moste is not a stranger to violence or civic duty. He was once a member of the Philippine Constabulary assigned in Lanao del Sur[16] and later with the PNP[17] and as such, he must have witnessed countless violent acts while relying on inner courage to preserve the life and limb of others. Given the circumstances as well as the character and experience of eyewitness Moste, we find nothing incredible in his reaction to the incident and his consequent testimony. While witnessing a crime is an unusual experience which draws varying reactions from different people, it is well-established that there can be no clear cut standard form of behavior or response that can be expected.[18] Fortunately for the prosecution, eyewitness Moste is possessed of better qualities than most men. No amount of nonchalance or even condescension on the part of the accused-appellants can diminish eyewitness Mosteâs apparent selflessness, as well as credibility. The fact that the victim sustained only six (6) stab wounds considering the amount of time that had elapsed is irrelevant to Mosteâs credibility as a witness. The length of time that a crime takes to accomplish is never an indication of the number or severity of the wounds that the perpetrators can inflict on a victim. It is sufficient that eyewitness Moste saw and recognized the appellants while they were engaged in the dastardly deed of stabbing the victim. Besides, the victim also sustained abrasions apart from the multiple stab wounds, as testified to by the doctor who conducted the autopsy.[19] It could even be concluded that said injury was sustained while the victim tried to fight off his assailants. The victimâs resistance obviously slowed down the accused-appellants in the perpetration of their crime. Be that as it may, this supposed inconsistency is too minor and insignificant to affect the credibility of Moste as a witness.[20] Besides, such a perceived inconsistency makes Mosteâs testimony even more credible. The rule is well-settled that inconsistencies and contradictions which are minor, trivial and inconsequential cannot impair the credibility of the witness. On the contrary, they only serve to strengthen the veracity of his categorical, straightforward and spontaneous testimony.[21] Consequently, it is of no moment that eyewitness Moste did not see any policemen or bodyguards of the candidates at the political rally. This argument is too trivial to be entertained. It has no bearing at all on the crime committed, and it is obvious that the accused-appellants are merely clutching at straws to bolster a very tenuous attack on the eyewitnessâ credibility. Given the weakness of the accused-appellantâs arguments impugning the credibility of eyewitness Moste, the trial court did not err in giving full weight and credence to his testimony. The factual findings of the trial court based on eyewitness Mosteâs testimony deserves the respect of this Court and must be accorded finality.[22] In the absence of any indication that the trial court overlooked some material fact or gravely abused its discretion, we see no compelling reason to interfere with the trial courtâs assessment of the eyewitnessâ credibility.[23] In the second assigned error, accused-appellants contend that the prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This contention is equally without merit. Even though Moste is the lone eyewitness to testify, his testimony is sufficient to convict the accused since his testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity, spontaneously and naturally delivered in a straightforward manner.[24] Besides, the accused-appellants never questioned eyewitness Mosteâs motives for testifying against them. There was no indication that Mosteâs motives were improper, such that he would be driven to falsely testify against the accused-appellants under solemn oath. It would run counter to the natural order of events and of human nature, and contrary to the presumption of good faith, for a prosecution witness to falsely testify if the accused is truly innocent.[25] Moreover, the lone testimony of eyewitness Moste, having been found credible and positive, is sufficient to convict the appellants for the truth is established not by quantity, but by the quality of his testimony.[26] Be that as it may, the accused-appellants argue that there was reasonable doubt because their defense of alibi was supported by candid and credible testimony. While admitting that the defense of alibi is inherently weak, such defense was sufficiently proven by the accused-appellants and their witnesses. The required elements for alibi to be appreciated are: (1) to prove the accusedâs presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime; and (2) to demonstrate that it would thus be physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime.[27] Accused-appellant Juliver Chua claimed that he was at a disco with his girlfriend at the time of the stabbing incident. His corroborative witnesses were his girlfriend, Carla Garces, and his mother, Antonia Chua. Accused-appellant Jesse Torre claimed that he was at home, sick with fever, a declaration which his mother, Rosita Torre, confirmed. An examination of the accused-appellantsâ defense of alibi reveals the same to be self-serving and undeserving of any weight in law. The appellants failed to present other witnesses to substantiate their alibi. Thus, their alibi was not sufficiently proven in the absence of credible corroboration from disinterested witnesses.[28] It is a well-entrenched rule that when an accusedâs alibi can only be confirmed by his relatives and friends who may not be impartial witnesses, his denial of culpability of affirmative testimony merits scant consideration, especially in the face of affirmative testimony of an eyewitness as to the accusedâs presence in the crime scene.[29] It has been uniformly held time and again that alibi and denial is worthless and cannot prevail over positive identification that is categorical, consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness.[30] Moreover, since the accused-appellantsâ alibi was established only by themselves, their relatives and friends, their denial of guilt should be treated with the strictest scrutiny.[31] While they claimed that the accused-appellants were at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime, they could not prove that it was physically impossible for the accused-appellants to be at the scene of the crime. As found by the trial court, to wit: There exists no physical impossibility in instances where it would take the accused only fifteen to twenty minutes by jeep or tricycle or some one and a half hours by foot to traverse the distance between the place where the accused allegedly was at the time of the commission and the scene of the crime. Recently, the highest Court has ruled that there can be no physical impossibility even if the distances between the two places is merely two (2) hours by bus. (People vs. Abuyan Jr., G.R. No. 95254-55, July 1992; People vs. Pidia, 249 SCRA 687). The testimony of accused Juliver Chuaâs mother (Antonia Chua) and his sweetheart (Carla Garcia) are bereft of any proof that accused Juliver Chua could not have been at the scene of the crime on the said date at around 9:30 in the evening.[32] We note that when faced with the indubitable evidence of the prosecution, it became âevery man for himselfâ for the accused-appellants. Juliver Chua testified that it was Macaliag and Torre who killed Jalani, while Macaliag countered by testifying that it was Chua who did the victim in. As most guilty conspirators are prone to do, when caught between a rock and a hard place, they turn on each other in the vain hope that blame is shifted to someone else. All these accusations and counter-accusations only tend to prove that they had personal knowledge of the crime. It is clearly a desperate ploy to escape culpability. It is not too difficult to see this tactic as a last-ditch attempt to pin the guilt on the other accused to bolster a sagging defense. The courts are not easily swayed by such conflicting testimonies, especially when the obvious motive is to distort the truth and frustrate the ends of justice. Finally, the accused-appellants assail the trial courtâs finding that the offense was committed with treachery as manifested by their taking advantage of their weapon and superiority in number. The accused-appellants contend that the trial court should not have convicted them for murder considering that the lone eyewitness did not see how the fatal incident started. It is well-established that treachery, to be considered a qualifying circumstance, must be proven as clearly and indubitably as the crime itself,[33] and it may not be simply deduced from presumption.[34] In the instant case, the trial court based its conclusion that there was treachery on the mere fact that there were three perpetrators as against a lone victim, and that a bladed weapon was used to execute the crime. The lower court, however, failed to consider that the lone eyewitness did not testify as to how the stabbing incident commenced, for indeed, said eyewitness would have no knowledge thereof. He arrived at the scene some time after the stabbing started and thus, he could not testify as to whether or not there was provocation on the part of the victim. This Court has uniformly ruled that treachery cannot qualify a killing to murder if the solitary eyewitness did not see the commencement of the assault. In the absence of indubitable testimony on the manner in which the aggression was commenced, treachery cannot be reasonably appreciated as a qualifying circumstance.[35] Thus, since the eyewitness failed to witness the initial attack inflicted on the victim, the qualifying circumstance of treachery cannot be applied.[36] In the recent case of People v. Cario,[37] this Court ruled that: âTreachery cannot be presumed, it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself. Thus, where no particulars are shown as to the manner by which the aggression was commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim began and developed, treachery can in no way be established from mere suppositions, drawn solely from circumstances prior to the killing. x x x. The crime thus committed is only homicide, not murder as held by the trial court.â And in the case of People v. Parras,[38] this Court had occasion to rule that: âTreachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, or as conclusively as the killing itself. x x x. In this regard, the prosecution failed to definitively establish the manner in which the initial assault against the deceased victim was committed to justify the appreciation of treachery. This hiatus in the prosecutionâs evidence cannot be substituted by mere suppositions as what the trial court apparently did. It is a well-settled rule that in order to appreciate treachery as a modifying circumstance in a continuous aggression, as in this case, the same must be shown present at the inception of the attack. Absent any showing therefor, treachery as a qualifying circumstance may not be considered.â Consequently, the trial court erred in finding the accused-appellants guilty of the crime of murder and penalizing them under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Under the circumstances, they can only be convicted of the lesser crime of homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. Nevertheless, it is clear that the crime was attended by the presence of an aggravating circumstance. It was committed with apparent abuse of superior strength. The victim was clearly overwhelmed by the combined efforts of all three (3) accused who not only enjoyed superiority in number, but also of weapons.[39] The records reveal that the defenseless victim was held back by accused Torre, while co-accused Chua and Macaliag took turns in stabbing him. There was obviously abuse of superior strength since all three (3) accused acted in concert to accomplish their felonious designs against the unarmed victim. They purposely took advantage of their superior number and combined strength and force which was grossly out of proportion to whatever means of defense was available to their victim.[40] Meanwhile, the aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot be considered since the records reveal that the scene of the crime was well-lighted by a fluorescent lamp. Nocturnity does not become a modifying factor when the place is adequately lighted, and thus could no longer insure the offenderâs immunity from identification or capture.[41] There being only one generic aggravating circumstance, the penalty imposed must be that prescribed by law, in its maximum period.[42] Based on all the foregoing, it is clear that the accused-appellants can only be found guilty of the crime of homicide and the appropriate penalty thereof is reclusion temporal in its maximum period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, accused-appellants should be sentenced to suffer ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum. The other co-accused, Leo Macaliag, who did not join the appellants in this appeal, shall also benefit from this judgment insofar as it is favorable and applicable to him.[43] WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment of the Regional Trial Court is hereby MODIFIED. Accused-appellants Juliver Chua and Jesse Torre, including co-accused Leo Macaliag, are found GUILTY of Homicide and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, with all the accessory penalties provided by law. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED, with costs against said accused-appellants. SO ORDERED. Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan, and Pardo, JJ., concur.

They are furthermore ordered to pay the heirs \nof the deceased, jointly and severally, the sum of P50,000.00 as and for\n the death of deceased Brian Jalani and further the sum of P20,000.00 as\n and for moral damages.\n\nSO ORDERED. [1]\n\nThis case originated from the information filed against \naccused-appellants Jesse Torre, a.k.a. âSasotâ and Juliver Chua, a.k.a. \nâBotyokâ, along with co-accused Leo Macaliag which alleged:\n\nThat on or about April 16, 1995, in the City of Iligan, \nPhilippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the \nsaid accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping\n each other, armed with a deadly weapon, by means of treachery and \nevident premeditation, and with intent to kill, did then and there \nwilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab and wound one\n Brian Jalani, thereby inflicting upon him the following physical \ninjuries, to wit:\n\n- Cardio Respiratory Arrest\n- Hypovolemic Shock, R shoulder\nR Infrascapular area, L Lumbar\nall penetrating\n\nwhich caused his death.\n\nContrary to and in violation of Article 248 of the Revised Penal \nCode with the aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident \npremeditation. [2]\n\nThe prosecution relied, for the most part, on the testimony of \neyewitness Anacleto Moste who related in open court the relevant \nincidents of that fateful night of April 16, 1995. According to him, he\n was then watching a political rally at Purok Rosal, Villaverde, Iligan \nCity on or about 9:30 oâclock in the evening when he heard a certain \nDavid, who was in a state of panic, asking for help because someone was \nbeing stabbed near Baslayan Creek, not too distant from where the rally \nwas taking place. When he arrived at the scene, he saw three (3) men \nattacking a lone victim. He was able to recognize the three (3) accused\n as the perpetrators, as well as the hapless victim, one Brian Jalani, \nfor they were all personally known to him. There was adequate lighting \ncoming from a nearby lamp post, and witness Moste was only a mere eight \n(8) to ten (10) meters away from them. Furthermore, there were no \nobstructions to his line of vision. In describing the positions of the \naccused relative to the victim, witness Moste testified that accused \nTorre was holding the neck of victim Jalani from the latterâs back, \nwhile the other two accused, Chua and Macaliag, were to the victimâs \nright and left, taking turns in stabbing him. He shouted at the \nperpetrators three (3) times before accused Torre pushed the victim into\n the creek, after which all the three (3) accused fled towards the \ndirection of Purok Gumamela. Moste was about to chase them, but decided\n against it when he heard the cries of the victim who was sinking into \nthe mud and gasping for breath, at the same time bleeding profusely from\n his stab wounds. Moste tried to solicit the aid of some onlookers, \nshouting for help, as he himself started to drown in the mud while \nstriving to keep victim Jalani from sinking. Finally, three workers \nfrom Dado Lechon took pity and pulled Moste and Jalani out of the muddy \ncreek.\n\nAfter some difficulty in securing a vehicle, the victim was \nfinally brought to the Dr. Uy Hospital for treatment, but he (Jalani) \nsuccumbed to death shortly thereafter. By then, witness Moste had \nalready left the hospital to notify Jalaniâs mother and to report the \nincident to one SPO4 Lubang, who happened to be Mosteâs neighbor. [3]\n\nThe prosecution also presented Dr. Livey Villarin to identify the\n necropsy report. The doctor testified that the victim sustained six \n(6) stab wounds in all: three (3) in front and three (3) at his back; \nthe most fatal of which was the one on the victimâs chest. [4]\n\nThe final witness for the prosecution was SPO4 Antonio Lubang who\n was, at the time of the incident, the Assistant Chief of the Special \nInvestigating Unit of Precinct 4 of the Iligan City Police Command. He \ntestified that at 1:00 oâclock in the early morning of April 17, 1995, \nhe was awakened by witness Moste and a certain Rene Alasagas who \nreported the stabbing incident involving the victim Brian Jalani and the\n three accused. He further averred that upon investigation, other \nwitnesses positively identified Macaliag as one of the perpetrators. He\n was also able to interview one Jeffrey Yorong who stated that had he \nnot been able to escape, he would have been the first victim of the same\n perpetrators that night. [5]\n\nThere were no immediate arrests since all three accused had fled \nthe vicinity. It was only on February 1, 1996 or almost ten (10) months\n later that accused Juliver Chua was apprehended. The other two \naccused, Leo Macaliag and Jesse Torre, were brought under the \njurisdiction of the trial court some four (4) months thereafter. Upon \ntheir arraignment, all three accused pleaded not guilty, interposing the\n defense of alibi.\n\nFor his part, accused Juliver Chua argued that he could not have \nbeen in the vicinity of the crime because he was then dancing at a disco\n in Tambacan, Iligan City; that he only returned to Villaverde, Iligan \nCity in the early hours of the morning of April 17, 1995; that he even \nmet prosecution witness Moste along the way, where the latter allegedly \nasked him (Chua) if he knew the whereabouts of Leo Macaliag and Jesse \nTorre.\n\nOn cross-examination, accused Chua testified that on or about \n1:10 in the morning, on his way home from the disco, he met co-accused \nLeo Macaliag and Jesse Torre at Aldo Arts and Signs, both of whom \npersuaded him to accompany them to Purok Manuang, Mahayahay, Iligan \nCity. It was there where he first learned that Brian Jalani had been \nstabbed to death by Macaliag and Torre, allegedly with the participation\n of one Jun Tacastacas and Michael Pato, who were then having a drinking\n session. He decided to go home because he was afraid that he would be \nimplicated in whatever crime Macaliag and the others had committed. [6]\n\nAccused Chuaâs alibi was corroborated by his girlfriend, Carla \nGarces. She testified that she was with Chua at the disco on the night \nof the incident and that they were together the whole time. They left \nthe disco together at about 1:00 oâclock in the morning, parting ways at\n the traffic light at Quezon Avenue. [7]\n\nNext to testify on Chuaâs behalf was his mother Antonia Chua, who\n related that at 10:00 oâclock in the evening of April 16, 1995, she \nwent to the disco to fetch her son, but she left him in the company of \nhis girlfriend Carla Garces who agreed to accompany him home. The elder\n Chua further stated that her son arrived home at 1:30 oâclock in the \nmorning of the following day. [8]\n\nOn the part of accused Jesse Torre, his mother, Rosita Torre \ntestified that at the time of the incident, Jesse was with her at their \nhome, sleeping until the following morning because he had a fever. \nAfter he recovered from his illness, accused Torre left for Cagayan de \nOro City, where he worked vending peanuts until he and co-accused Leo \nMacaliag were arrested in June of 1996. [9]\n\nAccused Jesse Torre reiterated that he was at home, sick with \nfever, on the night of the tragic incident. He denied knowing the \nvictim, Brian Jalani, while averring that he met co-accused Chua for the\n first time when both were already incarcerated in the city jail. He \nalso refuted earlier testimony that he and Macaliag were notoriously \nknown as partners in crime, saying that they were mere acquaintances. \nAnd contrary to accused Chuaâs earlier allegation, Torre said he was not\n with the group of Macaliag, Tacastacas, Pato and Chua in Barrio \nManuang, Mahayahay, Iligan City, in the early morning of April 17, 1995. [10]\n\nWhen it came time for accused Leo Macaliag to testify, he \nasserted that at the time of the incident, he was home drinking beer \nwith his father. He only learned of the incident when accused Chua came\n knocking and asked if he (Chua) could hide in the Macaliag house for a \nwhile. He recalled that Chuaâs clothes were bloodied and covered with \nmud, prompting him to refuse Chuaâs request. Shortly thereafter, SPO4 \nAntonio Lubang and prosecution witness Moste arrived, asking the \nwhereabouts of Leo Macaliagâs younger brother, Roel, who was then \nattending the political rally. He further averred that he stayed home \nfor several weeks before moving to Cagayan de Oro City, where he also \nfound a job selling peanuts until he was apprehended. [11]\n\nThe last witness for the defense was one Estela Minister, a \nneighbor of accused Macaliag, who testified that at 11:00 oâclock in the\n evening of April 16, 1995, she was doing her laundry in front of her \nhouse. She corroborated Macaliagâs testimony that accused Juliver Chua \ncame to the Macaliag residence, but Chua was harangued by Leoâs mother \nwho scolded him (Chua) and denied him entry. That upon seeing Chuaâs \ndirty clothes and bloodied hands, she discontinued her washing, fearful \nthat Chua would return. [12]\n\nAfter carefully evaluating all the conflicting testimonies and \nevidence adduced by the opposing parties, the Regional Trial Court \nrendered its decision finding all the accused guilty of the murder of \nBrian Jalani.\n\nNot satisfied with the decision rendered by the trial court, \naccused Jesse Torre and Juliver Chua filed the instant appeal. \nAccused-appellants contend that â\n\nI\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED EYEWITNESS.\n\nII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF \nTHE CRIME OF MURDER DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR \nGUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT AND IN NOT CONSIDERING THE DEFENSE \nINTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.\n\nIII\n\nON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANTS INDEED KILLED THE VICTIM,\n THEN THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF \nMURDER INSTEAD OF THE LESSER OFFENSE OF HOMICIDE. [13]\n\nIn support of the first and second assigned errors, the \naccused-appellants argued that while it is the rule that conclusions and\n findings of fact of the trial court are binding and are generally not \ndisturbed on appeal, said rule is not without exception, such as when \nthe trial court ignored and overlooked facts of such weight and \ninfluence which could alter the result if considered. [14] The appellants submit that their case is an exception to the general \nrule, for the trial court overlooked and ignored the fact that the \ntestimony of the alleged eyewitness Anacleto Moste was patently \nincredible and sadly lacking in truth, candor and spontaneity. [15]\n\nIn particular, the accused-appellants found it hard to believe \nthat Moste, knowing that the assailants were supposedly âpolice \ncharactersâ, could summon the courage to shout at them, and even \ncontemplate running after them. To the accused-appellants, such a show \nof bravery runs counter to the ordinary course of human experience. \nSecondly, they pointed out that Mosteâs testimony did not agree with the\n medical findings that the victim sustained only six (6) stab wounds, \nwhich in their opinion was too few considering that some amount of time \nhad elapsed since a certain David first witnessed the stabbing until \nMosteâs arrival at the scene. Furthermore, Mosteâs testimony that there\n were no policemen or bodyguards during the political rally at Purok \nRosal is not to be believed since it is public knowledge that there are \nalways bodyguards or police escorts protecting the candidates during \nrallies.\n\nThe accused-appellantsâ contentions are bereft of merit. The \ntrial court based its judgment on the credible and overwhelming evidence\n presented by the prosecution. Thus, we find no reason to disturb the \nconclusions or findings of fact of the trial court. First, the bravery,\n or even heroism, of eyewitness Moste should not be belittled by the \nappellantsâ apparent lack of faith in the inherent goodness of human \nbeings. While it cannot be denied that not all men are heroes, neither \nare all men cowards. Besides, what was in Mosteâs testimony that was \nunbelievable? He admitted that his initial reaction was fear, but such \nfear did not paralyze him to inaction or apathy. Instead, the better \nand more compassionate part of his being drove him to perform a civic, \nif not moral duty. Eyewitness Moste is not a stranger to violence or \ncivic duty. He was once a member of the Philippine Constabulary \nassigned in Lanao del Sur [16] and later with the PNP [17] and as such, he must have witnessed countless violent acts while \nrelying on inner courage to preserve the life and limb of others. Given\n the circumstances as well as the character and experience of eyewitness\n Moste, we find nothing incredible in his reaction to the incident and \nhis consequent testimony. While witnessing a crime is an unusual \nexperience which draws varying reactions from different people, it is \nwell-established that there can be no clear cut standard form of \nbehavior or response that can be expected. [18] Fortunately for the prosecution, eyewitness Moste is possessed of \nbetter qualities than most men. No amount of nonchalance or even \ncondescension on the part of the accused-appellants can diminish \neyewitness Mosteâs apparent selflessness, as well as credibility.\n\nThe fact that the victim sustained only six (6) stab wounds \nconsidering the amount of time that had elapsed is irrelevant to Mosteâs\n credibility as a witness. The length of time that a crime takes to \naccomplish is never an indication of the number or severity of the \nwounds that the perpetrators can inflict on a victim. It is sufficient \nthat eyewitness Moste saw and recognized the appellants while they were \nengaged in the dastardly deed of stabbing the victim. Besides, the \nvictim also sustained abrasions apart from the multiple stab wounds, as \ntestified to by the doctor who conducted the autopsy. [19] It could even be concluded that said injury was sustained while the \nvictim tried to fight off his assailants. The victimâs resistance \nobviously slowed down the accused-appellants in the perpetration of \ntheir crime. Be that as it may, this supposed inconsistency is too \nminor and insignificant to affect the credibility of Moste as a witness. [20]\n\nBesides, such a perceived inconsistency makes Mosteâs testimony \neven more credible. The rule is well-settled that inconsistencies and \ncontradictions which are minor, trivial and inconsequential cannot \nimpair the credibility of the witness. On the contrary, they only serve\n to strengthen the veracity of his categorical, straightforward and \nspontaneous testimony. [21]\n\nConsequently, it is of no moment that eyewitness Moste did not \nsee any policemen or bodyguards of the candidates at the political \nrally. This argument is too trivial to be entertained. It has no \nbearing at all on the crime committed, and it is obvious that the \naccused-appellants are merely clutching at straws to bolster a very \ntenuous attack on the eyewitnessâ credibility.\n\nGiven the weakness of the accused-appellantâs arguments impugning\n the credibility of eyewitness Moste, the trial court did not err in \ngiving full weight and credence to his testimony. The factual findings \nof the trial court based on eyewitness Mosteâs testimony deserves the \nrespect of this Court and must be accorded finality. [22] In the absence of any indication that the trial court overlooked some \nmaterial fact or gravely abused its discretion, we see no compelling \nreason to interfere with the trial courtâs assessment of the eyewitnessâ\n credibility. [23]\n\nIn the second assigned error, accused-appellants contend that the\n prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This \ncontention is equally without merit. Even though Moste is the lone \neyewitness to testify, his testimony is sufficient to convict the \naccused since his testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity, \nspontaneously and naturally delivered in a straightforward manner. [24] Besides, the accused-appellants never questioned eyewitness Mosteâs \nmotives for testifying against them. There was no indication that \nMosteâs motives were improper, such that he would be driven to falsely \ntestify against the accused-appellants under solemn oath. It would run \ncounter to the natural order of events and of human nature, and contrary\n to the presumption of good faith, for a prosecution witness to falsely \ntestify if the accused is truly innocent. [25]\n\nMoreover, the lone testimony of eyewitness Moste, having been \nfound credible and positive, is sufficient to convict the appellants for\n the truth is established not by quantity, but by the quality of his \ntestimony. [26]\n\nBe that as it may, the accused-appellants argue that there was \nreasonable doubt because their defense of alibi was supported by candid \nand credible testimony. While admitting that the defense of alibi is \ninherently weak, such defense was sufficiently proven by the \naccused-appellants and their witnesses.\n\nThe required elements for alibi to be appreciated are: (1) to \nprove the accusedâs presence at another place at the time of the \nperpetration of the crime; and (2) to demonstrate that it would thus be \nphysically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime. [27] Accused-appellant Juliver Chua claimed that he was at a disco with his\n girlfriend at the time of the stabbing incident. His corroborative \nwitnesses were his girlfriend, Carla Garces, and his mother, Antonia \nChua. Accused-appellant Jesse Torre claimed that he was at home, sick \nwith fever, a declaration which his mother, Rosita Torre, confirmed. An\n examination of the accused-appellantsâ defense of alibi reveals the \nsame to be self-serving and undeserving of any weight in law. The \nappellants failed to present other witnesses to substantiate their \nalibi. Thus, their alibi was not sufficiently proven in the absence of \ncredible corroboration from disinterested witnesses. [28]\n\nIt is a well-entrenched rule that when an accusedâs alibi can \nonly be confirmed by his relatives and friends who may not be impartial \nwitnesses, his denial of culpability of affirmative testimony merits \nscant consideration, especially in the face of affirmative testimony of \nan eyewitness as to the accusedâs presence in the crime scene. [29] It has been uniformly held time and again that alibi and denial is \nworthless and cannot prevail over positive identification that is \ncategorical, consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the \npart of the eyewitness. [30]\n\nMoreover, since the accused-appellantsâ alibi was established \nonly by themselves, their relatives and friends, their denial of guilt \nshould be treated with the strictest scrutiny. [31] While they claimed that the accused-appellants were at another place at\n the time of the perpetration of the crime, they could not prove that it\n was physically impossible for the accused-appellants to be at the scene\n of the crime. As found by the trial court, to wit:\n\nThere exists no physical impossibility in instances where it would \ntake the accused only fifteen to twenty minutes by jeep or tricycle or \nsome one and a half hours by foot to traverse the distance between the \nplace where the accused allegedly was at the time of the commission and \nthe scene of the crime. Recently, the highest Court has ruled that \nthere can be no physical impossibility even if the distances between the\n two places is merely two (2) hours by bus. (People vs. Abuyan Jr., \nG.R. No. 95254-55, July 1992; People vs. Pidia, 249 SCRA 687).\n\nThe testimony of accused Juliver Chuaâs mother (Antonia Chua) and \nhis sweetheart (Carla Garcia) are bereft of any proof that accused \nJuliver Chua could not have been at the scene of the crime on the said \ndate at around 9:30 in the evening. [32]\n\nWe note that when faced with the indubitable evidence of the \nprosecution, it became âevery man for himselfâ for the \naccused-appellants. Juliver Chua testified that it was Macaliag and \nTorre who killed Jalani, while Macaliag countered by testifying that it \nwas Chua who did the victim in. As most guilty conspirators are prone \nto do, when caught between a rock and a hard place, they turn on each \nother in the vain hope that blame is shifted to someone else. All these\n accusations and counter-accusations only tend to prove that they had \npersonal knowledge of the crime. It is clearly a desperate ploy to \nescape culpability. It is not too difficult to see this tactic as a \nlast-ditch attempt to pin the guilt on the other accused to bolster a \nsagging defense. The courts are not easily swayed by such conflicting \ntestimonies, especially when the obvious motive is to distort the truth \nand frustrate the ends of justice.\n\nFinally, the accused-appellants assail the trial courtâs finding \nthat the offense was committed with treachery as manifested by their \ntaking advantage of their weapon and superiority in number. The \naccused-appellants contend that the trial court should not have \nconvicted them for murder considering that the lone eyewitness did not \nsee how the fatal incident started.\n\nIt is well-established that treachery, to be considered a \nqualifying circumstance, must be proven as clearly and indubitably as \nthe crime itself, [33] and it may not be simply deduced from presumption. [34] In the instant case, the trial court based its conclusion that there \nwas treachery on the mere fact that there were three perpetrators as \nagainst a lone victim, and that a bladed weapon was used to execute the \ncrime. The lower court, however, failed to consider that the lone \neyewitness did not testify as to how the stabbing incident commenced, \nfor indeed, said eyewitness would have no knowledge thereof. He arrived\n at the scene some time after the stabbing started and thus, he could \nnot testify as to whether or not there was provocation on the part of \nthe victim.\n\nThis Court has uniformly ruled that treachery cannot qualify a \nkilling to murder if the solitary eyewitness did not see the \ncommencement of the assault. In the absence of indubitable testimony on\n the manner in which the aggression was commenced, treachery cannot be \nreasonably appreciated as a qualifying circumstance. [35] Thus, since the eyewitness failed to witness the initial attack \ninflicted on the victim, the qualifying circumstance of treachery cannot\n be applied. [36]\n\nIn the recent case of People v. Cario , [37] this Court ruled that:\n\nâTreachery cannot be presumed, it must be proved by clear and \nconvincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself. Thus, \nwhere no particulars are shown as to the manner by which the aggression \nwas commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim \nbegan and developed, treachery can in no way be established from mere \nsuppositions, drawn solely from circumstances prior to the killing. x x \nx. The crime thus committed is only homicide, not murder as held by the\n trial court.â\n\nAnd in the case of People v. Parras , [38] this Court had occasion to rule that:\n\nâTreachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, or as \nconclusively as the killing itself. x x x. In this regard, the \nprosecution failed to definitively establish the manner in which the \ninitial assault against the deceased victim was committed to justify the\n appreciation of treachery. This hiatus in the prosecutionâs evidence \ncannot be substituted by mere suppositions as what the trial court \napparently did. It is a well-settled rule that in order to appreciate \ntreachery as a modifying circumstance in a continuous aggression, as in \nthis case, the same must be shown present at the inception of the \nattack. Absent any showing therefor, treachery as a qualifying \ncircumstance may not be considered.â\n\nConsequently, the trial court erred in finding the accused-appellants\n guilty of the crime of murder and penalizing them under Article 248 of \nthe Revised Penal Code. Under the circumstances, they can only be \nconvicted of the lesser crime of homicide under Article 249 of the \nRevised Penal Code.\n\nNevertheless, it is clear that the crime was attended by the \npresence of an aggravating circumstance. It was committed with apparent \nabuse of superior strength. The victim was clearly overwhelmed by the \ncombined efforts of all three (3) accused who not only enjoyed \nsuperiority in number, but also of weapons. [39] The records reveal that the defenseless victim was held back by accused\n Torre, while co-accused Chua and Macaliag took turns in stabbing him. \nThere was obviously abuse of superior strength since all three (3) \naccused acted in concert to accomplish their felonious designs against \nthe unarmed victim. They purposely took advantage of their superior \nnumber and combined strength and force which was grossly out of \nproportion to whatever means of defense was available to their victim. [40]\n\nMeanwhile, the aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot be \nconsidered since the records reveal that the scene of the crime was \nwell-lighted by a fluorescent lamp. Nocturnity does not become a \nmodifying factor when the place is adequately lighted, and thus could no\n longer insure the offenderâs immunity from identification or capture. [41] There being only one generic aggravating circumstance, the penalty \nimposed must be that prescribed by law, in its maximum period. [42]\n\nBased on all the foregoing, it is clear that the \naccused-appellants can only be found guilty of the crime of homicide and\n the appropriate penalty thereof is reclusion temporal in its \nmaximum period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, \naccused-appellants should be sentenced to suffer ten (10) years and one \n(1) day of prision mayor , as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal ,\n as maximum. The other co-accused, Leo Macaliag, who did not join the \nappellants in this appeal, shall also benefit from this judgment insofar\n as it is favorable and applicable to him. [43]\n\nWHEREFORE , the appealed judgment of the Regional\n Trial Court is hereby MODIFIED. Accused-appellants Juliver Chua and \nJesse Torre, including co-accused Leo Macaliag, are found GUILTY of \nHomicide and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of ten (10) \nyears and one (1) day of prision mayor , as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal ,\n as maximum, with all the accessory penalties provided by law. In all \nother respects, the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED, with costs \nagainst said accused-appellants.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan , and Pardo, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 32.\n\n[2] Rollo, p. 9.\n\n[3] TSN, May 21, 1996, pp. 6-21.\n\n[4] TSN, September 3, 1996, pp. 12-18.\n\n[5] TSN, July 17, 1996, pp. 8-9.\n\n[6] TSN, November 20, 1996, pp. 21-38.\n\n[7] Id., pp. 3-10.\n\n[8] Id., pp. 11-20.\n\n[9] TSN, November 21, 1996, pp. 3-13.\n\n[10] Id., pp. 15-25.\n\n[11] TSN, February 6, 1997, pp. 3-15.\n\n[12] TSN, March 11, 1997, pp. 2-5.\n\n[13] Rollo, p. 57.\n\n[14] People v.
