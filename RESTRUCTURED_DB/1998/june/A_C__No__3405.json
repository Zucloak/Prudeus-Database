NARAG, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. DOMINADOR M. NARAG, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nJULIETA B. NARAG, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. DOMINADOR M. NARAG, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nGood moral character is a continuing qualification required of \nevery member of the bar. Thus, when a lawyer fails to meet the exacting \nstandard of moral integrity, the Supreme Court may withdraw his or her \nprivilege to practice law.\n\nOn November 13, 1989, Mrs. Julieta B. Narag filed an administrative complaint [1] for disbarment against her husband, Atty. Dominador M. Narag, whom she \naccused of having violated Canons 1 and 6, Rule 1.01 of the Code of \nEthics for Lawyers. [2]\n\nThe complainant narrated:\n\nâThe St. Louis College of Tuguegarao engaged the services of \nAtty. Dominador M. Narag in the early seventies as a full-time college \ninstructor in the College of Arts and Sciences and as a professor in the\n Graduate School. In 1984, Ms. Gina Espita, 17 years old and a first \nyear college student, enrolled in subjects handled by Atty. Narag. \nExerting his influence as her teacher, and as a prominent member of the \nlegal profession and then member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Tuguegarao,\n Atty. Narag courted Ms. Espita, gradually lessening her resistance \nuntil the student acceded to his wishes.\n\nThey then maintained an illicit relationship known in various \ncircles in the community, but which they managed to keep from me. It \ntherefore came as a terrible embar[r]assment to me, with unspeakable \ngrief and pain when my husband abandoned us, his family, to live with \nMs. Espita, in utterly scandalous circumstances.\n\nIt appears that Atty. Narag used his power and influence as a \nmember of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cagayan to cause the \nemployment of Ms. Espita at the Department of Trade and Industry Central\n Office at Makati, Metro Manila. Out of gratitude perhaps, for this \ngesture, Ms. Espita agreed to live with Atty. Narag, her sense of \nright[e]ousness and morals completely corrupted by a member of the Bar.\n\nIt is now a common knowledge in the community that Atty. \nDominador M. Narag has abandoned us, his family, to live with a \n22-year-old woman, who was his former student in the tertiary level[.]â [3]\n\nThis Court, in a Resolution dated December 18, 1989, referred the \ncase to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, \nreport and recommendation. [4]\n\nOn June 26, 1990, the office of then Chief Justice Marcelo B. \nFernan received from complainant another letter seeking the dismissal of\n the administrative complaint. She alleged therein that (1) she \nfabricated the allegations in her complaint to humiliate and spite her \nhusband; (2) all the love letters between the respondent and Gina Espita\n were forgeries; and (3) she was suffering from âemotional confusion \narising from extreme jealousy.â The truth, she stated, was that her \nhusband had remained a faithful and responsible family man. She further \nasserted that he had neither entered into an amorous relationship with \none Gina Espita nor abandoned his family. [5] Supporting her letter were an Affidavit of Desistance [6] and a Motion to Dismiss, [7] attached as Annexes âAâ and âB,â which she filed before the IBP commission on bar discipline. [8] In a Decision dated October 8, 1991, the IBP Board of Governors [9] dismissed the complaint of Mrs. Narag for failure to prosecute. [10]\n\nThe case took an unexpected turn when, on November 25, 1991, this Court [11] received another letter [12] from the complainant, with her seven children [13] as co-signatories, again appealing for the disbarment of her husband. \nShe explained that she had earlier dropped the case against him because \nof his continuous threats against her. [14]\n\nIn his Comment on the complainantâs letter of November 11, 1991, \nfiled in compliance with this Courtâs Resolution issued on July 6, 1992, [15] respondent prayed that the decision of the Board of Governors be \naffirmed. Denying that he had threatened, harassed or intimidated his \nwife, he alleged that she had voluntarily executed her Affidavit of \nDesistance [16] and Motion to Dismiss, [17] even appearing before the investigating officer, Commissioner Racela, \nto testify under oath âthat she prepared the Motion to Dismiss and \nAffidavit of Desistance on her own free will and affirmed the contents \nthereof.â\n\nIn addition, he professed his love for his wife and his children \nand denied abandoning his family to live with his paramour. However, he \ndescribed his wife as a person emotionally disturbed, viz .:\n\nâWhat is pitiable here is the fact that Complainant is an \nincurably jealous and possessive woman, and every time the streak of \njealousy rears its head, she fires off letters or complaints against her\n husband in every conceivable forum, all without basis, and purely on \nimpulse, just to satisfy the consuming demands of her âlovingâ jealousy.\n Then, as is her nature, a few hours afterwards, when her jealousy cools\n off, she repents and feels sorry for her acts against the Respondent. \nThus, when she wrote the Letter of November 11, 1991, she was then in \nthe grips of one of her bouts of jealousy.â [18]\n\nOn August 24, 1992, this Court issued another Resolution referring the Comment of respondent to the IBP. [19] In the hearing before IBP Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose, respondent alleged the following: [20]\n\nâ2. Your Respondent comes from very poor parents who have \nleft him not even a square meter of land, but gave him the best legacy \nin life: a purposeful and meaningful education. Complainant comes from \nwhat she claims to be very rich parents who value material possession \nmore than education and the higher and nobler aspirations in life. \nComplainant abhors the poor.\n\n3. Your Respondent has a loving upbringing, nurtured in \nthe gentle ways of love, forgiveness, humility, and concern for the \npoor. Complainant was reared and raised in an entirely different \nenvironment. Her value system is the very opposite.\n\n4. Your Respondent loves his family very dearly, and has \ndone all he could in thirty-eight (38) years of marriage to protect and \npreserve his family. He gave his family sustenance, a comfortable home, \nlove, education, companionship, and most of all, a good and respected \nname. He was always gentle and compassionate to his wife and children. \nEven in the most trying times, he remained calm and never inflicted \nviolence on them. His children are all now full-fledged professionals, \nmature, and gainfully employed. x x x\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nYour Respondent subscribes to the sanctity of marriage as a social institution.\n\nOn the other hand, consumed by insane and unbearable jealousy, \nComplainant has been systematically and unceasingly destroying the very \nfoundations of their marriage and their family. Their marriage has \nbecome a torture chamber in which Your Respondent has been incessantly \nBEATEN, BATTERED, BRUTALIZED, TORTURED, ABUSED, and HUMILIATED, \nphysically, mentally, and emotionally, by the Complainant, in public and\n at home. Their marriage has become a nightmare.\n\nFor thirty-eight years, your Respondent suffered in silence and \nbore the pain of his misfortune with dignity and with almost infinite \npatience, if only to preserve their family and their marriage. But this \nis not to be. The Complainant never mellowed and never became gentl[e], \nloving, and understanding. In fact, she became more fierce and \npredatory.\n\nHence, at this point in time, the light at the tunnel for Your \nRespondent does not seem in sight. The darkness continues to shroud the \nmarital and familial landscape.\n\nYour Respondent has to undergo a catharsis, a liberation from \nenslavement. Paraphrasing Dorfman in âDeath and the Maidenâ, can the \ntorturer and the tortured co-exist and live together?\n\nHence, faced with an absolutely uncomprehending and \nuncompromising mind whose only obsession now is to destroy, destroy, and\n destroy, Your Respondent, with perpetual regret and with great sorrow, \nfiled a Petition for Annulment of Marriage, Spl. Proc. No. 566, RTC, \nBranch III, Tuguegarao, Cagayan. x x x.\n\n5. Complainant is a violent husband-beater, vitriolic and \nunbending. But your Respondent never revealed these destructive \nqualities to other people. He preserved the good name and dignity of his\n wife. This is in compliance with the marital vow to love, honor or obey\n your spouse, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health. . . \nEven in this case, Your Respondent never revealed anything derogatory to\n his wife. It is only now that he is constrained to reveal all these \nthings to defend himself.\n\nOn the other hand, for no reason at all, except a jealous rage, \nComplainant tells everyone, everywhere, that her husband is worthless, \ngood-for-nothing, evil and immoral. She goes to colleges and \nuniversities, professional organizations, religious societies, and all \nother sectors of the community to tell them how evil, bad and immoral \nher husband is. She tells them not to hire him as professor, as Counsel,\n or any other capacity because her husband is evil, bad, and immoral. Is\n this love? Since when did love become an instrument to destroy a manâs \ndearest possession in life - his good name, reputation and dignity?\n\nBecause of Complainantâs virulent disinformation campaign against\n her husband, employing every unethical and immoral means to attain his \nends, Your Respondent has been irreparably and irreversibly disgraced, \nshamed, and humiliated. Your Respondent is not a scandalous man. It is \nhe who has been mercilessly scandalized and crucified by the \nComplainant.â [21]\n\nTo prove the alleged propensity of his wife to file false charges, \nrespondent presented as evidence the following list of the complaints \nshe had filed against him and Gina Espita:\n\nâ3.1  Complaint for Immorality/Neglect of Duty x x x\n3.2  Complaint for Immorality/Neglect of Duty, DILG, Adm. Case No. P-5-90. x x x\n3.3  Complaint for Concubinage. Provincial Prosecutorâs Office of Cagayan. I.S No. 89-114. x x x\n3.4  Complaint for Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices and concubinage.

Third MCTC, Tumauini, Isabela. Pending. x x xâ [22]\n\nIn his desperate effort to exculpate himself, he averred:\n\nâI. That all the alleged love letters and envelopes (xxx),\n picture (xxx) are inadmissible in evidence as enunciated by the Supreme\n Court in âCecilia Zulueta vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.â, G.R. No. \n107383, February 20, 1996. (xxx).\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nII. That respondent is totally innocent of the charges: He\n never courted Gina Espita in the Saint Louis College of Tuguegarao. He \nnever caused the employment of said woman in the DTI. He never had or is\n having any illicit relationship with her anywhere, at any time. He \nnever lived with her as husband and wife anywhere at any time, be it in \nCentro Tumauini or any of its barangays, or in any other place. He never\n begot a child or children with her. Finally, respondent submits that \nall the other allegations of Mrs. Narag are false and fabricated, xxx\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIII. Respondent never abandoned his family[.] Mrs. Narag \nand her two sons forcibly drove respondent Narag out of the conjugal \nhome. After that, Atty. Narag tried to return to the conjugal home many \ntimes with the help of mutual friends to save the marriage and the \nfamily from collapse. He tried several times to reconcile with Mrs. \nNarag. In fact, in one of the hearings of the disbarment case, he \noffered to return home and to reconcile with Mrs. Narag. But Mrs. Narag \nrefused all these efforts of respondent Narag. xxx\n\nIV. Complainant Julieta B. Narag is an unbearably jealous, \nviolent, vindictive, scandalous, virulent and merciless wife since the \nbeginning of the marriage, who incessantly beat, battered, brutalized, \ntortured, abuse[d], scandalized, and humiliated respondent Atty. Narag, \nphysically, mentally, emotionally, and psychologically, xxx.\n\nV. Complainant Julieta Naragâs claim in her \ncounter-manifestation dated March 28, 1996, to the effect that the \naffidavit of Dominador B. Narag, Jr., dated February 27, 1996 was \nobtained through force and intimidation, is not true. Dominador, Jr., \nexecuted his affidavit freely, voluntarily, and absolutely without force\n or intimidation, as shown by the transcript of stenographic notes of \nthe testimonies of Respondent Atty. Narag and Tuguegarao MTC Judge \nDominador Garcia during the trial of Criminal Case No. 12439, People vs.\n Dominador M. Narag, et. al., before the Tuguegarao MTC on May 3, 1996. x\n x x.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nVI. Respondent Atty. Narag is now an old man - a senior \ncitizen of 63 years - sickly, abandoned, disgraced, weakened and \ndebilitated by progressively degenerative gout and arthritis, and hardly\n able to earn his own keep. His very physical, medical, psychological, \nand economic conditions render him unfit and unable to do the things \nattributed to him by the complainant. Please see the attached medical \ncertificates, x x x, among many other similar certificates touching on \nthe same ailments. Respondent is also suffering from hypertension.â [23]\n\nOn July 18, 1997, the investigating officer submitted his report, [24] recommending the indefinite suspension of Atty. Narag from the practice\n of law. The material portions of said report read as follows:\n\nâCulled from the voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence \nsubmitted by the contending parties, two (2) issues are relevant for the\n disposition of the case, namely:\n\na) Whether there was indeed a commission of alleged \nabandonment of respondentâs own family and [whether he was] living with \nhis paramour, Gina Espita;\n\nb) Whether the denial under oath that his \nillegitimate children with Gina Espita (Aurelle Dominic and Kyle \nDominador) as appearing on paragraph 1(g) of respondentâs Comment \nvis-a-vis his handwritten love letters, the due execution and contents \nof which, although he objected to their admissibility for being \nallegedly forgeries, were never denied by him on the witness stand much \nless presented and offered proof to support otherwise.\n\nExcept for the testimonies of respondentâs witnesses whose \ntestimonies tend to depict the complaining wife, Mrs. Narag, as an \nincurably jealous wife and possessive woman suffering everytime with \nstreaks of jealousy, respondent did not present himself on the witness \nstand to testify and be cross-examined on his sworn comment; much less \ndid he present his alleged paramour, Gina Espita, to disprove the \nadulterous relationship between him and their having begotten their \nillegitimate children, namely: Aurelle Dominic N. Espita and Kyle \nDominador N. Espita. Worse, respondentâs denial that he is the father of\n the two is a ground for disciplinary sanction (Morcayda v. Naz, 125 \nSCRA 467).\n\nViewed from all the evidence presented, we find the respondent \nsubject to disciplinary action as a member of the legal profession.â [25]\n\nIn its Resolution [26] issued on August 23, 1997, the IBP adopted and approved the \ninvestigating commissionerâs recommendation for the indefinite \nsuspension of the respondent. [27] Subsequently, the complainant sought the disbarment of her husband in a\n Manifestation/Comment she filed on October 20, 1997. The IBP granted \nthis stiffer penalty and, in its Resolution dated November 30, 1997, \ndenied respondentâs Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nAfter a careful scrutiny of the records of the proceedings and the \nevidence presented by the parties, we find that the conduct of \nrespondent warrants the imposition of the penalty of disbarment.\n\nThe Code of Professional Responsibility provides:\n\nâRule 1.01-- A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.â\n\nâCANON 7-- A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and \ndignity of the legal profession, and support the activities of the \nIntegrated Bar.\n\nRule 7.03-- A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that \nadversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor should he, \nwhether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the \ndiscredit of the legal profession.â\n\nThus, good moral character is not only a condition precedent [28] to the practice of law, but a continuing qualification for all members of the bar. Hence, when a lawyer is found\n guilty of gross immoral conduct, he may be suspended or disbarred. [29]\n\nImmoral conduct has been defined as that conduct which is so \nwillful, flagrant, or shameless as to show indifference to the opinion \nof good and respectable members of the community. [30] Furthermore, such conduct must not only be immoral, but grossly immoral. That is, it must be so corrupt as to constitute a criminal act or so unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree [31] or committed under such scandalous or revolting circumstances as to shock the common sense of decency. [32]\n\nWe explained in Barrientos vs. Daarol [33] that, âas officers of the court, lawyers must not only in fact be of \ngood moral character but must also be seen to be of good moral character\n and leading lives in accordance with the highest moral standards of the\n community. More specifically, a member of the Bar and officer of the \ncourt is not only required to refrain from adulterous relationships or \nthe keeping of mistresses but must also so behave himself as to avoid \nscandalizing the public by creating the belief that he is flouting those\n moral standards.â\n\nRespondent Narag is accused of gross immorality for abandoning his \nfamily in order to live with Gina Espita. The burden of proof rests upon\n the complainant, and the Court will exercise its disciplinary power \nonly if she establishes her case by clear, convincing and satisfactory \nevidence. [34]\n\nPresented by complainant as witnesses, aside from herself, [35] were: Charlie Espita, [36] Magdalena Bautista, [37] Bienvenido Eugenio, [38] Alice Carag, [39] Dr. Jervis B. Narag, [40] Dominador Narag, Jr., [41] and Nieves F. Reyes. [42]\n\nCharlie Espita, brother of the alleged paramour Gina Espita, \ncorroborated complainantâs charge against respondent in these \ncategorical statements he gave to the investigating officer:\n\nâQ Mr. Witness, do you know Atty. Narag?\n\nA Yes, Your Honor, he is the live-in partner of my sister, Gina Espita.\n\nQ If Atty. Narag is here, can you point [to] him?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n (Witness pointed to the respondent, Atty. Dominador Narag)\n\nQ Why do you know Atty. Narag?\n\nATTY. NARAG:\n\nAlready answered. He said I am the live-in partner.\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE DIRECT\n\nA Because he is the live-in partner of my sister and that \nthey are now living together as husband and wife and that they already \nhave two children, Aurelle Dominic and Kyle Dominador.\n\nxxx xxx xxxâ [43]\n\nDuring cross-examination conducted by the respondent himself, \nCharlie Espita repeated his account that his sister Gina was living with\n the respondent, with whom she had two children:\n\nâQ Mr. Espita, you claim that Atty. Narag is now living with your sister as husband and wife. You claim that?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ Why do you say that?\n\nA Because at present you are living together as husband and \nwife and you have already two children and I know that that is really an\n immoral act which you cannot just allow me to follow since my moral \nvalues donât allow me that my sister is living with a married man like \nyou.\n\nQ How do you know that Atty. Narag is living with your sister? Did you see them in the house?\n\nA Yes, si[r].\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ You said also that Atty. Narag and your sister have two \nchildren, Aurelle Dominic and Kyle Dominador, is it not?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ How do you know that they are the children of Atty. Narag?\n\nA Because you are staying together in that house and you have left your family .â [44]\n\nIn addition, Charlie Espita admitted (1) that it was he who handed \nto Mrs. Narag the love letters respondent had sent to his sister, and \n(2) that Atty. Narag tried to dissuade him from appearing at the \ndisbarment proceedings. [45]\n\nWitness Bienvenido Eugenio strengthened the testimony of Charlie Espita in this wise:\n\nâQ Mr. Witness, do you know the respondent in this case?\n\nA I know him very well, sir.\n\nQ Could you please tell us why do you know him?\n\nA Because he was always going to the house of my son-in-law by the name of Charlie Espita.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ Mr. Eugenio, do you know the residence of Atty. Dominador M. Narag?\n\nA At that time, he [was] residing in the house of Reynaldo Angubong, sir.\n\nQ And this is located where?\n\nA Centro Tamauini, Isabela, sir.\n\nQ And you specifically, categorically state under oath that this is the residence of Atty. Narag?\n\nA Yes, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ And under oath this is where Atty. Narag and Gina Espita are allegedly living as husband and wife, is it not ?\n\nA Yes, sir.â [46]\n\nWitness Nieves Reyes, a neighbor and friend of the estranged \ncouple, testified that she learned from the Narag children -- Randy, \nBong and Rowena -- that their father left his family, that she and her \nhusband prodded the complainant to accept the respondent back, that the \nNarag couple again separated when the respondent âwent back to his \nwoman,â and that Atty. Narag had maltreated his wife. [47]\n\nOn the strength of the testimony of her witnesses, the complainant \nwas able to establish that respondent abandoned his family and lived \nwith another woman. Absent any evidence showing that these witnesses had\n an ill motive to testify falsely against the respondent, their \ntestimonies are deemed worthy of belief.\n\nFurther, the complainant presented as evidence the love letters \nthat respondent had sent to Gina. In these letters, respondent clearly \nmanifested his love for Gina and her two children, whom he acknowledged \nas his own. In addition, complainant also submitted as evidence the \ncards that she herself had received from him. Guided by the rule that \nhandwriting may be proved through a comparison of one set of writings \nwith those admitted or treated by the respondent as genuine, we affirm \nthat the two sets of evidence were written by one and the same person. [48] Besides, respondent did not present any evidence to prove that the love\n letters were not really written by him; he merely denied that he wrote \nthem.\n\nWhile the burden of proof is upon the complainant, respondent has \nthe duty not only to himself but also to the court to show that he is \nmorally fit to remain a member of the bar. Mere denial does not suffice.\n Thus, when his moral character is assailed, such that his right to \ncontinue practicing his cherished profession is imperiled, he must meet \nthe charges squarely and present evidence, to the satisfaction of the \ninvestigating body and this Court, that he is morally fit to have his \nname in the Roll of Attorneys. [49] This he failed to do.\n\nRespondent adamantly denies abandoning his family to live with Gina\n Espita. At the same time, he depicts his wife as a âviolent \nhusband-beater, vitriolic and unbending,â and as an âinsanely and \npathologically jealous woman,â whose only obsession was to âdestroy, \ndestroy and destroyâ him as shown by her filing of a series of allegedly\n unfounded charges against him (and Gina Espita). To prove his \nallegation, he presented ninety-eight (98) pieces of documentary \nevidence [50] and ten (10) witnesses. [51]\n\nWe note, however, that the testimonies of the witnesses of \nrespondent did not establish the fact that he maintained that moral \nintegrity required by the profession that would render him fit to \ncontinue practicing law. Neither did their testimonies destroy the fact,\n as proven by the complainant, that he had abandoned his family and \nlived with Gina Espita, with whom he had two children. Some of them \ntestified on matters which they had no actual knowledge of, but merely \nrelied on information from either respondent himself or other people, \nwhile others were presented to impeach the good character of his wife.\n\nRespondent may have provided well for his family -- they enjoyed a \ncomfortable life and his children finished their education. He may have \nalso established himself as a successful lawyer and a seasoned \npolitician. But these accomplishments are not sufficient to show his \nmoral fitness to continue being a member of the noble profession of law.\n\nWe remind respondent that parents have not only rights but also duties â e.g. ,\n to support, educate and instruct their children according to right \nprecepts and good example; and to give them love, companionship and \nunderstanding, as well as moral and spiritual guidance. [52] As a husband, he is also obliged to live with his wife; to observe \nmutual love, respect and fidelity; and to render help and support. [53]\n\nRespondent himself admitted that his work required him to be often \naway from home. But the evidence shows that he was away not only because\n of his work; instead, he abandoned his family to live with his \nparamour, who bore him two children. It would appear, then, that he was \nhardly in a position to be a good husband or a good father. His \nchildren, who grew up mostly under the care of their mother, must have \nscarcely felt the warmth of their fatherâs love.\n\nRespondentâs son, Jervis B. Narag, showed his resentment towards his fatherâs moral frailties in his testimony:\n\nâQ My question is this, is there any sin so grievous that it \ncannot be forgiven, is there a fault that is so serious that it is \nincapable of forgiveness?\n\nA That depends upon the sin or fault, sir, but if the sin or\n fault is with the emotional part of myself, I suppose I cannot forgive a\n person although I am a God-fearing person, but I h[av]e to give the \nperson a lesson in order for him or her to at least realize his \nmistakes, sir.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nCOMR. JOSE:\n\nI think it sounds like this. Assuming for the sake of argument \nthat your father is the worst, hardened criminal on earth, would you \nsend him to jail and have him disbarred? That is the question.\n\nCONTINUATION.\n\nA With the reputation that he had removed from us, I suppose\n he has to be given a lesson. At this point in time, I might just \nforgive him if he will have to experience all the pains that we have \nalso suffered for quite sometime.\n\nQ Dr. Narag, your father gave you life, his blood runs in \nyour veins, his flesh is your flesh, his bones are your bones and you \nnow disown him because he is the worst man on earth, is that what you \nare saying.\n\nA Sort of, sir.\n\nQ You are now telling that as far [as] you are concerned \nbecause your father has sinned, you have no more father, am I correct?\n\nA Long before, sir, I did not feel much from my father even \nwhen I was still a kid because my father is not always staying with us \nat home. So, how can you say that? Yes, he gave me life, why not? But \nfor sure, sir, you did not give me love.â [54]\n\nAnother son, Dominador Narag, Jr., narrated before the investigating officer the trauma he went through:\n\nQ In connection with that affidavit, Mr. Witness, which \ncontains the fact that your father is maintaining a paramour, could you \nplease tell this Honorable Commission the effect on you?\n\nA This has a very strong effect on me and this includes my \nbrothers and sisters, especially my married life, sir. And it also \naffected my children so much, that I and my wife ha[ve] parted ways. It \nhurts to say that I and my wife parted ways. This is one reason that \naffected us.\n\nQ Will you please tell us specifically why you and your wife parted ways?\n\nA Because my wife wa[s] ashamed of what happened to my \nfamily and that she could not face the people, our community, especially\n because my wife belongs to a well-known family in our community.\n\nQ How about the effect on your brothers and sisters? Please tell us what are those.\n\nA Well, sir, this has also affected the health of my elder \nsister because she knows so well that my mother suffered so much and she\n kept on thinking about my mother.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ Why did your wife leave you?\n\nA The truth is because of the things that had happened in our family, Your Honor.\n\nQ In your wifeâs family?\n\nA In our family, sir.\n\nQ And what do you mean by that?\n\nA What I meant by that is my father had an illicit \nrelationship and that my father went to the extent of scolding my wife \nand calling my wife a âputaâ in provincial government, which my \nmother-in-law hated him so much for this, which really affected us. And \nthen my wife knew for a fact that my father has an illicit relationship \nwith Gina Espita, whom he bore two children by the name of Aurelle \nDominic and Kyle Dominador, which I could prove and I stand firm to \nthis, Your Honor.â [55]\n\nAlthough respondent piously claims adherence to the sanctity of \nmarriage, his acts prove otherwise. A husband is not merely a man who \nhas contracted marriage. Rather, he is a partner who has solemnly sworn \nto love and respect his wife and remain faithful to her until death.\n\nWe reiterate our ruling in Cordova vs. Cordova [56] âThe moral delinquency that affects the fitness of a member of the bar \nto continue as such includes conduct that outrages the generally \naccepted moral standards of the community, conduct for instance, which \nmakes a mockery of the inviolable social institution of marriage.â\n\nIn Toledo vs. Toledo , [57] the respondent was disbarred from the practice of law, when he \nabandoned his lawful wife and cohabited with another woman who had borne\n him a child.\n\nLikewise, in Obusan vs. Obusan , [58] the respondent was disbarred after the complainant proved that he had \nabandoned her and maintained an adulterous relationship with a married \nwoman. This Court declared that respondent failed to maintain the \nhighest degree of morality expected and required of a member of the bar.\n\nIn the present case, the complainant was able to establish, by \nclear and convincing evidence, that respondent had breached the high and\n exacting moral standards set for members of the law profession. As held\n in Maligsa vs. Cabanting , [59] âa lawyer may be disbarred for any misconduct, whether in his \nprofessional or private capacity, which shows him to be wanting in moral\n character, in honesty, probity and good demeanor or unworthy to \ncontinue as an officer of the court.â\n\nWHEREFORE , Dominador M. Narag is hereby DISBARRED \nand his name is ORDERED STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys. Let copies \nof this Decision be in the personal record of Respondent Narag; and \nfurnished to all courts of the land, the Integrated Bar of the \nPhilippines, and the Office of the Bar Confidant.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nNarvasa, C.J., Regalado, Davide, Jr., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Martinez, Quisumbing, and Purisima, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] See records, Vol. I, \npp. 1-2.
