      "title": "met the constitutional demand for a clear and distinct statement of the facts and the law on which the decision was based. The CA\u2019s Sixth Division did not have to point out and discuss the flaws of FH-GYMN\u2019s petition considering that the decision of the Deputy Ombudsman sufficiently detailed the factual and legal bases for the denial of the petition.Moreover, the CA\u2019s Sixth Division expressly found that FH-GYMN had not discharged its burden as the petitioner of proving its allegations with substantial evidence.[16] In administrative cases involving judicial officers, the complainants always carried on their shoulders the burden of proof to substantiate their allegations through substantial evidence. That standard of substantial evidence is satisfied only when there is reasonable ground to believe that the respondent is responsible for the misconduct complained of although such evidence may not be overwhelming or even preponderant.[17]Secondly, Ongjoco ought to know, if he genuinely wanted the Court to sustain his allegations of misconduct against respondent Justices, that his administrative complaint must rest on the quality of the evidence; and that his basing his plain accusations on hunches and speculations would not suffice to hold them administratively liable for rendering the adverse decision. Nonetheless, he exhibited disrespect for respondent Justices\u2019 judicial office by still filing this administrative complaint against them despite conceding in the administrative complaint itself his having no proof of his charges, viz:21. The petition to review in determining probable cause in a preliminary investigation had reached this far and may reach the Supreme Court due to corrupt practices and culpable violation of the 1987 Constitution committed by Ombudsman officials and the herein respondents of the Court of Appeals. A Motion for Reconsideration was submitted with prayer for the respondents to inhibit themselves to act on it. Otherwise, it will add to congest the court docket which this Honorable Court should intercede to look deeper into this matter by exercising its disciplinary functions over herein respondents. The arbitrary denial of the Petition for Review rendered by the herein respondents is meant that there is no sufficient ground out of the five (5) issues raised to engender a well-founded belief that no single offense has been committed.[18]xxx24. Though there was no clear evidence to link Ombudsman officials, they may have persuaded, induced or influenced the herein respondents, who are either their schoolmates or associates, to deny the Petition for Review in their bid to establish innocence on the related offense charged against them on 18 August 2010 before the Office of the President docketed as OP-DC Case No. 11-C-006. Likewise, they may have manipulated the delivery of a copy of Decision intended for the petitioner in order for the latter to fail in submitting a motion for reconsideration purposely to make the Decision final and executory by which the said Ombudsman officials could use such Decision to attain impunity on complaint against them filed with the Office of the President.[19] (emphasis supplied)It is evident to us that Ongjoco\u2019s objective in filing the administrative complaint was to take respondent Justices to task for the regular performance of their sworn duty of upholding the rule of law. He would thereby lay the groundwork for getting back at them for not favoring his unworthy cause. Such actuations cannot be tolerated at all, for even a mere threat of administrative investigation and prosecution made against a judge to influence or intimidate him in his regular performance of the judicial office always subverts and undermines the independence of the Judiciary.[20]We seize this occasion, therefore, to stress once again that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions brought against any judge in relation to the performance of his official functions are neither complementary to nor suppletory of appropriate judicial remedies, nor a substitute for such remedies.[21] Any party who may feel aggrieved should resort to these remedies, and exhaust them, instead of resorting to disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions. We explained why in In Re: Joaquin T. Borromeo:[22]Given the nature of the judicial function, the power vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court and the lower courts established by law, the question submits to only one answer: the administrative or criminal remedies are neither alternative or cumulative to judicial review where such review is available, and must wait on the result thereof.Simple reflection will make this proposition amply clear, and demonstrate that any contrary postulation can have only intolerable legal implications. Allowing a party who feels aggrieved by a judicial order or decision not yet final and executory to mount an administrative, civil or criminal prosecution for unjust judgment against the issuing judge would, at a minimum and as an indispensable first step, confer the prosecutor (Ombudsman) with an incongruous function pertaining, not to him, but to the courts: the determination of whether the questioned disposition is erroneous in its findings of fact or conclusions of law, or both. If he does proceed despite that impediment, whatever determination he makes could well set off a proliferation of administrative or criminal litigation, a possibility hereafter more fully explored.Such actions are impermissible and cannot prosper. It is not, as already pointed out, within the power of public prosecutors, or the Ombudsman or his Deputies, directly or vicariously, to review judgments or final orders or resolutions of the Courts of the land. The power of review\u2014by appeal or special civil action\u2014is not only lodged exclusively in the Courts themselves but must be exercised in accordance with a well-defined and long established hierarchy, and long standing processes and procedures. No other review is allowed; otherwise litigation would be interminable, and vexatiously repetitive.In this regard, we reiterate that a judge\u2019s failure to correctly interpret the law or to properly appreciate the evidence presented does not necessarily incur administrative liability,[23] for to hold him administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders, assuming he has erred, will be nothing short of harassment and will make his position doubly unbearable. His judicial office will then be rendered untenable, because no one called upon to try the facts or to interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment.[24] Administrative sanction and criminal liability should be visited on him only when the error is so gross, deliberate and malicious, or is committed with evident bad faith,[25] or only in clear cases of violations by him of the standards and norms of propriety and good behavior prescribed by law and the rules of procedure, or fixed and defined by pertinent jurisprudence.[26]What the Court sees herein is Ongjoco\u2019s proclivity to indiscriminately file complaints. His proclivity reminds us now of Joaquin T. Borromeo whom this Court pronounced guilty of indirect contempt of court he \u201crepeatedly committed over time, despite warnings and instructions given to him.\u201d[27] The Court imposed the penalty for contempt of court \u201cto the end that he may ponder his serious errors and grave misconduct and learn due respect for the Courts and their authority.\u201d[28]Having determined that the administrative charge against respondent Justices had no factual and legal bases, we cannot hesitate to shield them by immediately rejecting the charge. We do so because unfounded administrative charges do not contribute anything worthwhile to the orderly administration of justice; instead, they retard it.Nor should we just let such rejected charge pass and go unchallenged. We recognize that unfounded administrative charges against judges really degrade the judicial office, and interfere with the due performance of their work for the Judiciary. Hence, we deem to be warranted to now direct Ongjoco to fully explain his act of filing an utterly baseless charge against respondent Justices.ACCORDINGLY, the Court: (a) DISMISSES the administrative complaint against Associate Justice Juan Q. Enriquez, Jr., Associate Justice Ramon M. Bato, Jr., and Associate Justice Florito S. Macalino for its utter lack of merit; and (b) ORDERS Engr. Oscar L. Ongjoco to show cause in writing within ten (10) days from notice why he should not be punished for indirect contempt of court for degrading the judicial office of respondent Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals, and for interfering with the due performance of their work for the Judiciary.SO ORDERED.Corona, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Reyes, and Perlas-Bernabe, JJ., concur.Abad and Sereno, JJ., on leave.[1] Rollo, p. 2.[2] Id., pp. 3-11.[3] Id., pp. 12-20.[4] Id., pp. 34-35 (the other amendment was to implement a color-coding scheme for the tricycles belonging to the two existing operators/drivers associations and the complainant cooperative).[5] Id., pp. 34-36.[6] Id., p. 36.[7] Id., pp. 37-38.[8] Id., pp. 61-71.[9] Id., pp. 12-20.[10] Id., pp. 21-31.[11] Id., pp. 9-10.[12] Civil Service Commission v.

JUAN Q. ENRIQUEZ, JR., HON. RAMON M. BATO, JR. AND HON. FLORITO S. MACALINO, ASSOCIATE JUSTICES, COURT OF APPEALSR E S O L U T I O N\nRE: VERIFIED COMPLAINT OF ENGR. OSCAR L. ONGJOCO, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD/CEO OF FH-GYMN MULTI-PURPOSE AND TRANSPORT SERVICE COOPERATIVE, AGAINST HON. JUAN Q. ENRIQUEZ, JR., HON. RAMON M. BATO, JR. AND HON. FLORITO S. MACALINO, ASSOCIATE JUSTICES, COURT OF APPEALS\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nBERSAMIN, J.:\n\nJudicial officers do not have to suffer the brunt of unsuccessful or dissatisfied litigants\u2019 baseless and false imputations of their violating the Constitution in resolving their cases and of harboring bias and partiality towards the adverse parties. The litigant who baselessly accuses them of such violations is not immune from appropriate sanctions if he thereby affronts the administration of justice and manifests a disrespect towards the judicial office.\n\nAntecedents\n\nOn June 7, 2011, the Court received a letter from Engr. Oscar L. Ongjoco, claiming himself to be the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the FH-GYMN Multi-Purpose and Transport Service Cooperative (FH-GYMN). [1] The letter included a complaint-affidavit, [2] whereby Ongjoco charged the CA\u2019s Sixth Division composed of Associate Justice Juan Q. Enriquez, Jr. (as Chairman), Associate Justice Ramon M. Bato, Jr., and Associate Justice Florito S. Macalino as Members for rendering an arbitrary and baseless decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 102289 entitled FH-GYMN Multi-Purpose and Transport Service Cooperative v. Allan Ray A. Baluyut, et al. [3]\n\nThe genesis of CA-G.R. SP No. 102289 started on July 26, 2004 when FH-GYMN requested the amendment of Kautusang Bayan Blg. 37-02-97 of the City of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan through the Committee on Transportation and Communications (Committee) of the Sangguniang Panlungsod (Sanggunian) in order to include the authorization of FH-GYMN\u2019s Chairman to issue motorized tricycle operators permit (MTOP) to its members. [4] During the ensuing scheduled public hearings, City Councilors Allan Ray A. Baluyut and Nolly Concepcion, together with ABC President Bartolome B. Aguirre and one Noel Mendoza (an employee of the Sanggunian ), were alleged to have uttered statements exhibiting their bias against FH-GYMN, giving FH-GYMN reason to believe that the Committee members were favoring the existing\u00a0 franchisees\u00a0 Francisco\u00a0 Homes Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association (FRAHTODA) and Barangay Mulawin Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association (BMTODA). [5] Indeed, later on, the Sanggunian , acting upon the recommendation of the Committee, denied the request of FH-GYMN. [6]\n\nOn July 15, 2005, FH-GYMN brought a complaint in the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon charging Baluyut, Concepcion, Aguirre, Mendoza with violations of Article 124(2)(d) of the Cooperative Code, Section 3(e) and (f) of the Republic Act No. 3019 ( Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act ), and Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 6713 ( Code of Conduct for Public Officials and Employees ). The complaint also charged Eduardo de Guzman (FRAHTODA President) and Wilson de Guzman (BMTODA President). Eventually, the complaint of FH-GYMN was dismissed for insufficiency of evidence as to the public officials, and for lack of merit and lack of jurisdiction as to the private respondents. FH-GYMN sought reconsideration, but its motion to that effect was denied. [7]\n\nFH-GYMN timely filed a petition for review in the CA.\n\nIn the meanwhile, FH-GYMN filed in the Office of the President a complaint accusing Overall Deputy Ombudsman Orlando C. Casimiro, Deputy Ombudsman Emilio A. Gonzales III, and Graft Investigator and Prosecution Officer Robert C. Renido with a violation of Section 3(i) of Republic Act No. 3019 arising from the dismissal of its complaint. [8]\n\nOn January 31, 2011, the CA\u2019s Sixth Division denied the petition for review. [9]\n\nFH-GYMN, through Ongjoco, moved for the reconsideration of the denial of the petition for review, with prayer for inhibition, [10] but the CA\u2019s Sixth Division denied the motion.\n\nThereafter, Ongjoco initiated this administrative case against the aforenamed member of the CA\u2019s Sixth Division.\n\nIn the complaint, Ongjoco maintained that respondent members of the CA\u2019s Sixth Division violated Section 14, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution by not specifically stating the facts and the law on which the denial of the petition for review was based; that they summarily denied the petition for review without setting forth the basis for denying the five issues FH-GYMN\u2019s petition for review raised; that the denial was \u201cunjust, unfair and partial,\u201d and heavily favored the other party; that the denial of the petition warranted the presumption of \u201cdirectly or indirectly becoming interested for personal gain\u201d under Section 3(i) of Republic Act No. 3019; and that the Ombudsman officials who were probably respondent Justices\u2019 schoolmates or associates persuaded, induced or influenced said Justices to dismiss the petition for review and to manipulate the delivery of the copy of the decision to FH-GYMN to prevent it from timely filing a motion for reconsideration. [11]\n\nRuling\nWe find the administrative complaint against respondent Justices of the Court of Appeals baseless and utterly devoid of legal and factual merit, and outrightly dismiss it.\n\nFirstly, Ongjoco insists that the decision promulgated on January 31, 2011 by the CA\u2019s Sixth Division had no legal foundation and did not even address the five issues presented in the petition for review; and that the respondents as members of the CA\u2019s Sixth Division thereby violated Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution, which provides as follows:\n\nSection 14. No decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.\n\nNo petition for review or motion for reconsideration of a decision of the court shall be refused due course or denied without starting the legal basis therefor.\nThe insistence of Ongjoco is unfounded. The essential purpose of the constitutional provision is to require that a judicial decision be clear on why a party has prevailed under the law as applied to the facts as proved; the provision nowhere demands that a point-by-point consideration and resolution of the issues raised by the parties are necessary. [12] Cogently, the Court has said in Tichangco v. Enriquez, [13] to wit:\n\nThis constitutional provision deals with the disposition of petitions for review and of motions for reconsideration. In appellate courts, the rule does not require any comprehensive statement of facts or mention of the applicable law, but merely a statement of the \u201clegal basis\u201d for denying due course.\n\nThus, there is sufficient compliance with the constitutional requirement when a collegiate appellate court, after deliberation, decides to deny a motion; states that the questions raised are factual or have already been passed upon; or cites some other legal basis.\u00a0 There is no need to explain fully the court\u2019s denial, since the facts and the law have already been laid out in the assailed Decision . (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIts decision shows that the CA\u2019s Sixth Division complied with the requirements of the constitutional provision, [14] viz :\n\nThe petition is without merit.\n\nPetitioner alleged that the Ombudsman erred in not finding respondents liable for violation of the Cooperative Code of the Philippines considering that their actuations constituted acts of direct or indirect interference or intervention with the internal affairs of FH-GYMN and that recommendation to deny FH-GYMN\u2019s application was tantamount to \u201cany other act inimical or adverse to its autonomy and independence.\u201d\n\nWe disagree.\n\nIt is well settled that in administrative proceedings, the complainant has the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, the allegations in his complaint.\u00a0 Section 27 of the Ombudsman Act is unequivocal.\u00a0 Findings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman, when supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.\u00a0 Conversely, when the findings of fact by the Ombudsman are not adequately supported by substantial evidence, they shall not be binding upon the courts ( Marcelo vs. Bungubung, 552 SCRA 589).\n\nIn the present case, the Deputy Ombudsman found no substantial evidence to prove that there was interference in the internal affairs of FH-GYMN nor was there a violation of the law by the respondents.\u00a0 As aptly ruled by the Ombudsman:\n\n\u201cWhile the utterances made by respondents Baluyot, Aguirre and Mendoza in the course of public hearings earlier mentioned indeed demonstrate exaltation of FRAHTODA and BMTODA, to the apparent disadvantage of FH-GYMN, the same does not imply or suggest interference in the internal affairs of the latter considering that said remarks or comments were made precisely in the lawful exercise of the mandate of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of the locality concerned through the Committee on Transportation and Communication.\u00a0 It is worthy to emphasize that were it not for the complainant\u2019s letter-request dated July 23, 2004, the committee concerned would not have conducted the aforementioned public hearings, thus, there would have been no occasion for the subject unfavorable remarks to unleash.\u00a0 Thus, it would be irrational to conclude that simply because the questioned utterances were unfavorable to FH-GYMN, the same constitutes interference or intervention in the internal affairs of the said cooperative.\n\nIn the same vein, while respondents Baluyot, Concepcion and Aguirre rendered an adverse recommendation as against complaint\u2019s letter-request earlier mentioned, the same does not signify giving of undue favors to FRAHTODA or BMTODA, or causing of undue injury to FH-GYMN, inasmuch as said recommendation or decision, as the records vividly show,\u00a0 was arrived at by the said respondents in honest exercise of their sound judgment based on their interpretation of the applicable\u00a0 ordinance governing the operation of tricycles within their area of jurisdiction.\u00a0 Evidence on record no doubt failed to sufficiently establish that, in so making the questioned recommendation, respondents Baluyot, Concepcion and Aguirre acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.\u00a0 It is likewise worthy to note that, contrary to complainant\u2019s insinuation, the letter-request adverted to was acted upon by respondents Baluyot, Concepcion and Aguirre within a reasonable time and, as a matter of fact, complainant had been notified of the action taken by the former relative to his letter-request or proposals.\n\nTime and again, it has been held, no less than by the Supreme Court, that mere suspicions and speculations can never be the basis of conviction in a criminal case.\u00a0 Guided by the same doctrinal rule, this Office is not duty-bound to proceed with the indictment of the public respondents as charged.\u00a0 Indeed well entrenched is the rule that \u201c(t)he purpose of a preliminary investigation is to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution and to protect him from an open and public accusation of crime, from the trouble, expense and anxiety of a public trial, and also to protect the state from useless and expensive trials ( Joint Resolution, October 17, 2005, Rollo pp. 142-143).\nMoreover, petitioners failed to rebut the presumption of regularity in the performance of the official duties of respondents by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty.\u00a0 The presumption prevails and becomes conclusive until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\u00a0 Every reasonable intendment will be made in support of the presumption and in case of doubt as to an officer\u2019s act being lawful or unlawful, construction should be in favor of its lawfulness ( Bustillo vs. People of the Philippines , G.R. No. 160718, May 12, 2010).\n\nThere being no substantial evidence to reverse the findings of the Ombudsman, the instant petition is denied.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered the Petition for Review is DENIED for lack of merit.\u00a0 The Joint Resolution dated October 17, 2005 and Joint Order dated April 25, 2006 of the Deputy Ombudsman of Luzon are AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nIndeed, the definitive pronouncement of the CA\u2019s Sixth Division that \u201cthe Deputy Ombudsman found no substantial evidence to prove that there was interference in the internal affairs of FH-GYMN nor was there a violation of the law by the respondents\u201d [15] met the constitutional demand for a clear and distinct statement of the facts and the law on which the decision was based. The CA\u2019s Sixth Division did not have to point out and discuss the flaws of FH-GYMN\u2019s petition considering that the decision of the Deputy Ombudsman sufficiently detailed the factual and legal bases for the denial of the petition.\n\nMoreover, the CA\u2019s Sixth Division expressly found that FH-GYMN had not discharged its burden as the petitioner of proving its allegations with substantial evidence. [16] In administrative cases involving judicial officers, the complainants always carried on their shoulders the burden of proof to substantiate their allegations through substantial evidence. That standard of substantial evidence is satisfied only when there is reasonable ground to believe that the respondent is responsible for the misconduct complained of although such evidence may not be overwhelming or even preponderant. [17]\n\nSecondly, Ongjoco ought to know, if he genuinely wanted the Court to sustain his allegations of misconduct against respondent Justices, that his administrative complaint must rest on the quality of the evidence ; and that his basing his plain accusations on hunches and speculations would not suffice to hold them administratively liable for rendering the adverse decision. Nonetheless, he exhibited disrespect for respondent Justices\u2019 judicial office by still filing this administrative complaint against them despite conceding in the administrative complaint itself his having no proof of his charges, viz :\n\n21. The petition to review in determining probable cause in a preliminary investigation had reached this far and may reach the Supreme Court due to corrupt practices and culpable violation of the 1987 Constitution committed by Ombudsman officials and the herein respondents of the Court of Appeals. A Motion for Reconsideration was submitted with prayer for the respondents to inhibit themselves to act on it. Otherwise, it will add to congest the court docket which this Honorable Court should intercede to look deeper into this matter by exercising its disciplinary functions over herein respondents . The arbitrary denial of the Petition for Review rendered by the herein respondents is meant that there is no sufficient ground out of the five (5) issues raised to engender a well-founded belief that no single offense has been committed. [18]\n\nxxx\n24. Though there was no clear evidence to link Ombudsman officials, they may have persuaded, induced or influenced the herein respondents, who are either their schoolmates or associates, to deny the Petition for Review in their bid to establish innocence on the related offense charged against them on 18 August 2010 before the Office of the President docketed as OP-DC Case No. 11-C-006. Likewise, they may have manipulated the delivery of a copy of Decision intended for the petitioner in order for the latter to fail in submitting a motion for reconsideration purposely to make the Decision final and executory by which the said Ombudsman officials could use such Decision to attain impunity on complaint against them filed with the Office of the President. [19] (emphasis supplied)\nIt is evident to us that Ongjoco\u2019s objective in filing the administrative complaint was to take respondent Justices to task for the regular performance of their sworn duty of upholding the rule of law. He would thereby lay the groundwork for getting back at them for not favoring his unworthy cause. Such actuations cannot be tolerated at all, for even a mere threat of administrative investigation and prosecution made against a judge to influence or intimidate him in his regular performance of the judicial office always subverts and undermines the independence of the Judiciary. [20]\n\nWe seize this occasion, therefore, to stress once again that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions brought against any judge in relation to the performance of his official functions are neither complementary to nor suppletory of appropriate judicial remedies, nor a substitute for such remedies. [21] Any party who may feel aggrieved should resort to these remedies, and exhaust them, instead of resorting to disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions. We explained why in In Re: Joaquin T. Borromeo : [22]\n\nGiven the nature of the judicial function, the power vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court and the lower courts established by law, the question submits to only one answer: the administrative or criminal remedies are neither alternative or cumulative to judicial review where such review is available, and must wait on the result thereof.\n\nSimple reflection will make this proposition amply clear, and demonstrate that any contrary postulation can have only intolerable legal implications. Allowing a party who feels aggrieved by a judicial order or decision not yet final and executory to mount an administrative, civil or criminal prosecution for unjust judgment against the issuing judge would, at a minimum and as an indispensable first step, confer the prosecutor (Ombudsman) with an incongruous function pertaining, not to him, but to the courts: the determination of whether the questioned disposition is erroneous in its findings of fact or conclusions of law, or both. If he does proceed despite that impediment, whatever determination he makes could well set off a proliferation of administrative or criminal litigation, a possibility hereafter more fully explored.\n\nSuch actions are impermissible and cannot prosper. It is not, as already pointed out, within the power of public prosecutors, or the Ombudsman or his Deputies, directly or vicariously, to review judgments or final orders or resolutions of the Courts of the land. The power of review\u2014by appeal or special civil action\u2014is not only lodged exclusively in the Courts themselves but must be exercised in accordance with a well-defined and long established hierarchy, and long standing processes and procedures. No other review is allowed; otherwise litigation would be interminable, and vexatiously repetitive.\nIn this regard, we reiterate that a judge\u2019s failure to correctly interpret the law or to properly appreciate the evidence presented does not necessarily incur administrative liability, [23] for to hold him administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders, assuming he has erred, will be nothing short of harassment and will make his position doubly unbearable. His judicial office will then be rendered untenable, because no one called upon to try the facts or to interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. [24] Administrative sanction and criminal liability should be visited on him only when the error is so gross, deliberate and malicious, or is committed with evident bad faith, [25] or only in clear cases of violations by him of the standards and norms of propriety and good behavior prescribed by law and the rules of procedure, or fixed and defined by pertinent jurisprudence. [26]\n\nWhat the Court sees herein is Ongjoco\u2019s proclivity to indiscriminately file complaints. His proclivity reminds us now of Joaquin T. Borromeo whom this Court pronounced guilty of indirect contempt of court he \u201crepeatedly committed over time, despite warnings and instructions given to him.\u201d [27] The Court imposed the penalty for contempt of court \u201cto the end that he may ponder his serious errors and grave misconduct and learn due respect for the Courts and their authority.\u201d [28]\n\nHaving determined that the administrative charge against respondent Justices had no factual and legal bases, we cannot hesitate to shield them by immediately rejecting the charge. We do so because unfounded administrative charges do not contribute anything worthwhile to the orderly administration of justice; instead, they retard it.\n\nNor should we just let such rejected charge pass and go unchallenged. We recognize that unfounded administrative charges against judges really degrade the judicial office, and interfere with the due performance of their work for the Judiciary. Hence, we deem to be warranted to now direct Ongjoco to fully explain his act of filing an utterly baseless charge against respondent Justices.\n\nACCORDINGLY , the Court: ( a ) DISMISSES the administrative complaint against Associate Justice Juan Q. Enriquez, Jr., Associate Justice Ramon M. Bato, Jr., and Associate Justice Florito S. Macalino for its utter lack of merit; and ( b ) ORDERS Engr. Oscar L. Ongjoco to show cause in writing within ten (10) days from notice why he should not be punished for indirect contempt of court for degrading the judicial office of respondent Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals, and for interfering with the due performance of their work for the Judiciary.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCorona, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Reyes , and Perlas-Bernabe, JJ. , concur.\nAbad and Sereno, JJ., on leave.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 2.\n\n[2] Id. , pp. 3-11.\n\n[3] Id. , pp. 12-20.\n\n[4] Id. , pp. 34-35 (the other amendment was to implement a color-coding scheme for the tricycles belonging to the two existing operators/drivers associations and the complainant cooperative).\n\n[5] Id. , pp. 34-36.\n\n[6] Id. , p. 36.\n\n[7] Id. , pp. 37-38.\n\n[8] Id. , pp. 61-71.\n\n[9] Id. , pp. 12-20.\n\n[10] Id. , pp. 21-31.\n\n[11] Id. , pp. 9-10.\n\n[12] Civil Service Commission v.

PHILIPPINE CARPET MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, RAUL RODRIGO AND MANUEL TROVELA, RESPONDENTS.DECISION\nPHILIPPINE CARPET EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND JONATHAN BARQUIN, PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE CARPET MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, RAUL RODRIGO AND MANUEL TROVELA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nGONZAGA-REYES, J.:\n\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari seeks the reversal of the Resolution of the Court of Appeals [1] in CA G.R. SP No. 41985 [2] dated January 29, 1999 which reversed and set aside its Decision dated January 30, 1998 ordering the reinstatement of Jonathan Barquin.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed:\n\u201cThe Philippine Carpet Employees Association (Union for brevity) is the certified sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent of all rank and file employees in Philippine Carpet Manufacturing Corporation, a local company engaged in the business of carpet and rug making. Jonathan Barquin is a union member who was hired by the company as casual worker (janitor) on July 15, 1995. Seven months later, on January 27, 1996, he was extended a probationary employment, as a helper in the Company\u2019s weaving department.\n\nOn January 16, 1996, the Regional Tripartite Productivity Board (NCR) promulgated Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A granting a two-tier increase in the minimum wage as follows: (a) P16.00 effective February 2, 1996; and (b) P4.00 effective May 1, 1996.\n\nOn February 29, 1996, the Union wrote the company and its officers, asking for an across-the-board implementation of Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A. In the said letter, the Union invoked the Company\u2019s \u2018decades old practice of implementing wage orders across-the-board to all rank and file employees.\n\nIn a letter dated March 14, 1996, the company refused to grant the Union\u2019s request on the ground that the company is suffering from poor business situation; that all the present workers/employees are earning above P145.00/day, hence, not covered by Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A.\n\nOn March 18, 1996, the Union reiterated its demand for an across-the-board implementation, threatening legal action against the company in the event that the said demand is denied.\n\nIn a memorandum dated March 29, 1996, the Company reiterated its position that the employees are not covered by Wage order No. 4 and 4-A for the reason that nobody in the company is receiving a salary of P145.00 a day.\n\nIn the meantime, Jonathan Barquin received a notice dated March 14, 1996 from the company, advising him that his services were to be terminated effective at the close of working hours on April 13, 1996. In lieu of the 30-day notice requirement for his termination, he was placed on forced leave status effective March 15, 1996 but was paid in full for the duration of the said leave. The company justified Baquin\u2019s separation from the service as a valid act of retrenchment. While the Union averred that the separation is tantamount to illegal dismissal resorted to by the company to avoid compliance with the provisions of Wage Order 4 and 4-A.\u201d [3] Failing to resolve the issues in the mediation level, the parties agreed to submit the case for voluntary arbitration. On August 3, 1996, the voluntary arbitrator, Angelita Alberto-Gacutan ruled that Jonathan Barquin (BARQUIN) was hastily dismissed to avoid compliance with Wage Order Nos. 4 and 4-A, but held that he is not entitled to reinstatement because he received his separation pay and voluntarily signed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim and acquiesced to his separation. The dispositive portion of the Resolution [4] of the voluntary arbitrator reads:\n\u201cWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, herein Voluntary Arbitrator renders judgment ordering Respondents:\n\n1. To pay the minimum wage to those receiving P145.00 a day or below the minimum wage of P161.00 as of February 2, 1996.\n\n2. To pay Jonathan Barquin a salary differential based on the wage increase as of February 2, 1996 up to his separation from the service on April 13, 1996.\n\n3. To apply the formula prescribed under section 11, Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A, thereby avoiding the possible distortion in the wage structure of the employees.\n\nSO ORDERED.\u201d [5] Motion for reconsideration [6] was denied prompting both the petitioners and the respondents to appeal to the Court of Appeals assailing the decision of the voluntary arbitrator. On January 30, 1998, the Court of Appeals ruled that the respondent company failed to prove actual poor financial condition as just cause for retrenchment nor prove that BARQUIN voluntarily signed the quitclaim; thus the court affirmed with modification the decision of the voluntary arbitrator and ordered BARQUIN\u2019s reinstatement as follows:\n\u201cWHEREFORE, the appealed Resolution is hereby AFFIRMED with modification that Jonathan Barquin shall be reinstated with payment of full backwages and other benefits and privileges from the time he was dismissed up to actual reinstatement.\u201d [7] A motion for reconsideration filed by private respondent was partly granted; the Court of Appeals reconsidered its earlier decision and set aside the order of reinstatement of BARQUIN, on the ground that BARQUIN had the burden to prove that his execution of the Deed of Release and Quitclaim was involuntary. [8] The Resolution of the Court of Appeals states:\n\u201cAccordingly, the motion for reconsideration is partly granted. Our Decision is hereby partly reconsidered by setting aside the reinstatement of Jonathan Barquin.\u201d [9] Motion for reconsideration of this last Resolution filed by the herein petitioners was denied [10] for lack of merit; hence this present appeal wherein the petitioners state the issue as: \u201cwhether there being a finding of illegal dismissal by the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals, the relief of reinstatement follows as a matter of law as provided by Article 279 of the Labor Code and jurisprudence.\u201d [11] The following arguments are raised in support of the petition.\nA\n\nTHE DECISION OF THE HON. COURT REVERSING ITS EARLIER RULING OF ORDERING FOR (sic) THE REINSTATEMENT OF JONATHAN BARQUIN IS CONTRARY TO THE LABOR CODE (ARTICLE 279) AND JURISPRUDENTIAL LAW.\n\nWHERE THERE IS A FINDING OF ILLEGAL DISMISSAL THE LAWFUL CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH FINDING IS REINSTATEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 279 OF THE LABOR CODE AND JURISPRUDENTIAL LAW.\n\nB\n\nTHE HON. COURT\u2019S RULING IS CONTRARY TO THE DOCTRINE LAID DOWN IN TREND LINE CASE, G.R. NO. 112923, BARQUIN WAS MISLED BY RESPONDENTS INTO SIGNING THE QUITCLAIM BY PRETENDING THERE WAS A VALID RETRENCHMENT.\n\nC\n\nTHE HON. COURT, IT IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN RULING THAT THERE IS A PRESUMPTION OF VOLUNTARINESS OF EXECUTION OF QUITCLAIMS IN LABOR CASE (sic) CONTRARY TO THE DOCTRINE LAID DOWN IN THE CASE OF SALONGA VERSUS NLRC, G.R. NO. 118120.\n\nD\n\nSIGNING QUITCLAIMS DOES NOT BAR THE PURSUIT OF ILLEGAL DISMISSAL CASE.\n\nTHE SIGNING OF QUITCLAIM DOES NOT BAR THE PURSUIT OF ILLEGAL DISMISSAL CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH JURISPRUDENCE - EMILIANO A. RIZALDE VERSUS NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, G.R. NO. 96982, SEPT. 21, 1999 (THIRD DIVISION). [12] The only issue posed now concerns the reinstatement of BARQUIN. In essence, the petitioners maintain that since both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals found that petitioner, BARQUIN, was illegally dismissed, he is entitled to reinstatement as a matter of right pursuant to Article 279 of the Labor Code [13] The petitioners also contend that contrary to the finding of both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator, BARQUIN did not voluntarily sign the Deed of Release and Quitclaim. [14] It was the fact that the respondent company misled him into signing said deed by leading him to believe in bad faith that there was a valid retrenchment, which made him sign the quitclaim. Petitioners further argue that at any rate, quitclaims are not favored in this jurisdiction and it is incumbent upon the employer to prove voluntariness; that by signing the quitclaim and by accepting separation pay to tide him over while pursuing the case, BARQUIN did not renounce any right nor will the signing of the quitclaim prevent him from pursuing his case.\n\nRespondents, on the other hand, maintain that the finding of both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals that BARQUIN freely and voluntarily signed and executed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim is a factual finding which is conclusive and should be given great weight and respect by this Court. Moreover, the respondents claim that the consideration therein was a fair and full settlement of the amount legally due to BARQUIN who never alleged that he was physically threatened or intimidated into signing the quitclaim.\n\nIn essence, the petitioners\u2019 position is that as a consequence of a finding that BARQUIN\u2019s dismissal was illegal as he was misled by the company into believing that there was a valid retrenchment, which representation made him sign the quitclaim, he is entitled to reinstatement and backwages [15] The respondent company, on the other hand, points out that the crux of the controversy boils down to the resolution of the issue of the validity of the Deed of Release and Quitclaim signed by BARQUIN, and both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals ruled that it was freely and intelligently signed by him.\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nIt is not disputed that the respondent company was guilty of illegal dismissal in terminating BARQUIN\u2019s employment. As a rule, an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to 1) either reinstatement or separation pay if reinstatement is no longer viable, and 2) backwages. [16]\n\nIn holding that although BARQUIN was illegally dismissed he was not entitled to reinstatement, both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator upheld the validity of the Deed of Release and Quitclaim that BARQUIN signed after concluding that he voluntarily signed the same for the reason that the respondent company did not coerce or intimidate him into signing and receiving his separation pay, and consequently ruled that he waived his right to reinstatement. The Court of Appeals added that the burden of proof to show that the quitclaim was signed and executed involuntarily is on the party who assails it inasmuch as a person is presumed to intend the consequences of his voluntary act and that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns and that private transactions have been fair and regular. [17] Respondents posit that such a factual finding is conclusive upon this Court.\n\nWe disagree.\n\nThe validity of quitclaims executed by laborers has long been recognized in this jurisdiction. In Periquet vs. National Labor Relations Commission [18] , this Court ruled that not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public policy. [19] If the agreement was voluntarily entered into and represents a reasonable settlement of the claims of the employee, it is binding on the parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind. [20] Such legitimate waivers resulting from voluntary settlements of laborer\u2019s claims should be treated and upheld as the law between the parties. [21] However, when as in this case, the voluntariness of the execution of the quitclaim or release is put into issue, then the claim of employee may still be given due course. [22] The law looks with disfavor upon quitclaims and releases by employees pressured into signing the same by unscrupulous employers minded to evade legal responsibilities. [23]\n\nIn the present case, both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator erred in concluding that BARQUIN voluntarily signed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim. Records reveal that the respondent company informed BARQUIN that his services were being terminated on the ground of retrenchment as the company was constrained to reduce the number of its personnel \u201cdue to the tremendous drop of production output since about the last quarter of 1994 up to the present\u201d. [24] However, this claim was rejected by both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals, which ruled that the respondent company failed to prove that it was suffering from actual poor financial condition and that it was \u201cdoubtful if the retrenchment of one helper in the production department earning P145.00 a day would avert losses of the company\u201d [25] Instead, the voluntary arbitrator found that the respondent company had an ulterior motive behind BARQUIN\u2019s dismissal and that only he was singled out and retrenched by the respondent company. The voluntary arbitrator went as far as saying that BARQUIN\u2019s hasty dismissal in the guise of retrenchment was a feeble attempt at circumventing the law. [26] It was shown that BARQUIN was the only employee earning P145.00 a day and was qualified to receive the mandated wage increase granted by Wage Order Nos. 4 and 4-A. An increase in his salary would cause a wage distortion in the wage structure of the company, which would necessitate the adjustment of the wages of its other employees. [27] It is therefore reversible error to hold, despite such findings, that BARQUIN voluntarily signed the quitclaim for the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that the respondent company feigned that it was suffering business losses in order to justify retrenchment and consequently enable it to terminate the services of BARQUIN in order to prevent the wage distortion. Respondent company\u2019s lack of candor and good faith in informing BARQUIN that he was being terminated due to a valid retrenchment and not because it sought to avoid compliance with the mandated wage increases amounted to a deception which led BARQUIN to the mistaken belief that that there was legal ground for retrenchment and prompted him to acquiesce to his termination and sign the quitclaim. Petitioners correctly point out that such an act has been declared by this Court in the case of Trendline Employees Association-Southern Philippines Federation of Labor vs. NLRC [28] as tainted with bad faith and should not be countenanced as being prejudicial and oppressive to labor. [29] Verily, had the respondent company not misled BARQUIN into believing that there was a ground to retrench, it is not difficult to believe that he would have thought twice before signing the quitclaim inasmuch there was no reason for the termination of his employment.\n\nContrary to the assumption of both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator, the mere fact that BARQUIN was not physically coerced or intimidated does not necessarily imply that he freely or voluntarily consented to the terms of the quitclaim. Under Article 1330 of the Civil Code, consent may be vitiated not only through intimidation or violence but also by mistake , undue influence or fraud . Mistake may invalidate consent when it refers to the substance of the thing which is the object of the contract or to those conditions which have principally moved one or both parties to enter into contract [30] ; there is fraud when, through insidious words or machinations of one of the contracting parties, the other is induced to enter into a contract which, without them, he would not have agreed to. [31]\n\nMoreover, as correctly pointed out by the petitioners, this Court has ruled in Salonga vs. National Labor Relations Commisison [32] that it is the employer (respondent company) and not BARQUIN who has the burden of proving that the quitclaim was voluntarily entered into by him. [33] The Court of Appeals therefore erred in ruling that the burden of proof to show that the Deed of Release and Quitclaim was signed and executed voluntarily was on BARQUIN.\n\nBARQUIN\u2019s consent to the quitclaim cannot be deemed as being voluntarily and freely given inasmuch as his consent was vitiated by mistake or fraud, we have no recourse but to annul the same. There being no valid quitclaim, BARQUIN is entitled to receive the benefits granted an employee whose dismissal on the ground of retrenchment is declared illegal. BARQUIN is therefore entitled to reinstatement to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, as there is no evidence to show that reinstatement is no longer possible. [34] He is also entitled to backwages computed from the time of his dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement, without qualification or deduction. [35] However, the amount BARQUIN received as separation pay if any when he signed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim should be deducted from this monetary award. [36]\n\nACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is GRANTED and the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 41985 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Respondent Philippine Carpet Manufacturing Corporation is hereby ordered to reinstate Jonathan Barquin to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to pay him backwages computed from the time of his dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement, without qualification or deduction except for the amount previously received by him as separation pay.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nMelo, (Chairman), Vitug, Panganiban, and Purisima, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Eleventh Division composed of the ponente J.

      "title": "CRISOSTOMO VILLARIN AND ANIANO LATAYADA, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N DEL CASTILLO, J.: Mere possession of timber without the legal documents required under forest laws and regulations makes one automatically liable of violation of Section 68, Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 705,[1] as amended. Lack of criminal intent is not a valid defense.This petition for review on certiorari seeks to reverse the June 28, 2005 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 26720 which affirmed in all respects the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 38, Cagayan De Oro City, finding petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 68, P.D. No. 705, as amended. Likewise assailed in this petition is the September 22, 2006 Resolution[4] denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.[5]Factual AntecedentsIn a Criminal Complaint[6] filed before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 4, Cagayan de Oro City by Marcelino B. Pioquinto (Pioquinto), Chief of the Forest Protection and Law Enforcement Unit under the TL Strike Force Team of Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), petitioner Aniano Latayada (Latayada) and three others namely, Barangay Captain Camilo Sudaria (Sudaria) of Tagpangi, Cagayan de Oro City, Marlon Baillo (Baillo) and Cipriano Boyatac (Boyatac), were charged with violation of Section 68, P.D. No. 705 as amended by Executive Order No. 277.[7]Subsequently, however, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Cagayan de Oro City issued a Resolution[8] dated March 13, 1996 recommending the filing of an Information for the aforesaid charge not only against Latayada, Baillo and Boyatac but also against petitioner Crisostomo Villarin (Villarin), then Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City. The dismissal of the complaint against Sudaria was likewise recommended. Said Resolution was then approved by the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao through a Resolution[9] dated May 9, 1996 ordering the filing of the Information in the RTC of Cagayan de Oro City.Thus, on October 29, 1996, an Information[10] was filed against petitioners Villarin and Latayada and their co-accused Baillo and Boyatac, for violation of Section 68, P.D. No. 705 as follows:That on or about January 13, 1996, in Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, pursuant to RA 7975, the accused, Crisostomo Villarin, a public officer being the Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, this City, with salary grade below 27, taking advantage of his official position and committing the offense in relation to his office, and the other above-named accused, all private individuals, namely: Marlon Baillo, Cipriano Boyatac, and Aniano Latayada, confederating and mutually helping one another did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously gather and possess sixty-three (63) pieces flitches of varying sizes belonging to the Apitong specie with a total volume of Four Thousand Three Hundred Twenty Six (4,326) board feet valued at P108,150.00, without any authority and supporting documents as required under existing forest laws and regulation to the damage and prejudice of the government.CONTRARY TO LAW.[11]On January 14, 1997, Villarin, Boyatac and Baillo, filed a Motion for Reinvestigation.[12] They alleged that the Joint Affidavit[13]of the personnel of the DENR which became one of the bases in filing the Information never mentioned Villarin as one of the perpetrators of the crime while the accusations against Baillo and Boyatac were not based on the personal knowledge of the affiants. They also asserted that their indictment was based on polluted sources, consisting of the sworn statements of witnesses like Latayada and Sudaria, who both appeared to have participated in the commission of the crime charged.Instead of resolving the Motion for Reinvestigation, the RTC, in its Order[14] dated January 27, 1997, directed Villarin, Boyatac, and Baillo to file their Motion for Reinvestigation with the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao, it being the entity which filed the Information in Court. On March 31, 1997, only Villarin filed a Petition for Reinvestigation[15] but same was, however, denied by the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao in an Order[16] dated May 15, 1997 because the grounds relied upon were not based on newly discovered evidence or errors of fact, law or irregularities that are prejudicial to the interest of the movants, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 07 or the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman in Criminal Cases. The Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao likewise opined that Villarin was directly implicated by Latayada, his co-accused.The RTC thus proceeded with the arraignment of the accused who entered separate pleas of not guilty.[17] Thereafter, trial ensued.The Version of the ProsecutionOn December 31, 1995, at around five o'clock in the afternoon, prosecution witness Roland Granada (Granada) noticed that a public utility jeep loaded with timber stopped near his house. The driver, petitioner Latayada, was accompanied by four to five other persons, one of whom was Boyatac while the rest could not be identified by Granada.[18] They alighted from the jeep and unloaded the timber 10 to 15 meters away from the Batinay bridge at Barangay Pagalungan, Cagayan De Oro City. Another prosecution witness, Pastor Pansacala (Pansacala), also noticed the jeep with plate number MBB 226 and owned by Sudaria, loaded with timber.[19] Being then the president of a community-based organization which serves as a watchdog of illegal cutting of trees,[20] Pansacala even ordered a certain Mario Bael to count the timber.[21]At six o'clock in the evening of the same day, Barangay Captain Angeles Alarcon (Alarcon)[22] noticed that the pile of timber was already placed near the bridge. Since she had no knowledge of any scheduled repair of the Batinay bridge she was surprised to discover that the timber would be used for the repair. After inquiring from the people living near the bridge, she learned that Latayada and Boyatac delivered the timber.[23]Another prosecution witness, Ariel Palanga (Palanga), testified that at seven o'clock in the morning of January 1, 1996, Boyatac bought a stick of cigarette from his store and requested him to cover the pile of timber near the bridge for a fee. Palanga acceded and covered the pile with coconut leaves.[24]On January 13, 1996, at around ten o'clock in the morning, prosecution witness Juan Casenas (Casenas), a radio and TV personality of RMN-TV8, took footages of the timber[25] hidden and covered by coconut leaves. Casenas also took footages of more logs inside a bodega at the other side of the bridge. In the following evening, the footages were shown in a news program on television.On the same day, members of the DENR Region 10 Strike Force Team measured the timber which consisted of 63 pieces of Apitong flitches and determined that it totaled 4,326 board feet[26] and subsequently entrusted the same to Alarcon for safekeeping.Upon further investigation, it was learned that the timber was requisitioned by Villarin, who was then Barangay Captain of Pagulangan, Cagayan de Oro City. Villarin gave Sudaria the specifications for the requisitioned timber. Thereafter, Boyatac informed Villarin that the timber was already delivered on December 31, 1995.[27]On January 18, 1996, Felix Vera Cruz (Vera Cruz), a security guard at the DENR Region 10 Office, received and signed for the confiscated timber since the property custodian at that time was not around.The filing of the aforestated Information followed.The Version of the DefenseIn response to the clamor of the residents of Barangays Tampangan, Pigsag-an, Tuburan and Taglinao, all in Cagayan De Oro City, Villarin, decided to repair the impassable Batinay bridge. The project was allegedly with the concurrence of the Barangay Council.Pressured to immediately commence the needed repairs, Villarin commissioned Boyatac to inquire from Sudaria about the availability of timber without first informing the City Engineer. Sudaria asked for the specifications which Villarin gave. Villarin then asked Baillo and Boyatac to attend to the same. When the timber was already available, it was transported from Tagpangi to Batinay. However, the timber flitches were seized by the DENR Strike Force Team and taken to its office where they were received by Vera Cruz, the security guard on duty.Ruling of the Regional Trial CourtIn its Memorandum filed before the trial court, the defense notified the court of Boyatac's demise.[28] However, the trial court did not act on such notice. Instead, it proceeded to rule on the culpability of Boyatac. Thus, in its Judgment, the trial court found herein petitioners and the deceased Boyatac guilty as charged. On the other hand, it found the evidence against Baillo insufficient. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing findings, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Crisostomo Villarin, Cipriano Boyatac and Aniano Latayada guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 68 of Presidential Decree No. 705 as amended, and hereby sentences each of them to suffer an indeterminate sentence of twelve (12) years of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years of reclusion temporal as maximum.Accused Marlon Baillo is hereby acquitted for lack of evidence.SO ORDERED.[29]In reaching said conclusions, the RTC noted that:Without an iota of doubt, accused Crisostomo Villarin, being then a Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City, was the one who procured the subject flitches, while accused Aniano Latayada and Cipriano Boyatac mutually helped him and each other by transporting the flitches from Sitio Batinay to the Pagalungan Bridge. The accused would like to impress upon the Court that the subject fltiches were intended for the repair of the Pagalungan Bridge and were acquired by virtue of Barangay Resolution No. 110 of Barangay Pagalungan. The Court is not impressed by this lame excuse. There is no dispute that the flitches were intended for the repair of the bridge. The Court finds it a laudable motive. The fact remains though that the said forest products were obtained without the necessary authority and legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations.[30]Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration[31] which was denied by the RTC in its Order[32] dated August 20, 2002.Ruling of the Court of Appeals Petitioners filed an appeal which was denied by the CA in its Decision dated June 28, 2005. The dispositive portion of which reads:WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the judgment of the court a quo finding [d]efendant-[a]ppellants Crisostomo Villarin, Cipriano Boyatac and Aniano Latayada GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violating Sec. 68 of Presidential Decree 705 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto. No pronouncement as to cost.SO ORDERED.[33]Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration[34] which the appellate court denied for lack of merit in its Resolution[35] promulgated on September 22, 2006.IssuesUndeterred, petitioners filed the instant petition raising the following issues:WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS[,] ON [THE] MATTER OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION[,] DECIDED NOT IN ACCORD WITH JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT;WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS DEPARTED FROM WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SAYING, THAT, TO CONVICT AN ACCUSED ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME MUST BE PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT and;WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS[,] IN AFFIRMING THE PENALTY IMPOSED BY THE COURT A QUO[,] DEPARTED FROM JURISPRUDENCE THAT EVEN IN CRIMES [INVOLVING] VIOLATION OF SPECIAL LAWS[,] SPECIAL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT [CAN BE CONSIDERED AS MITIGATING HAD THE VIOLATION BEEN PENALIZED UNDER THE REVISED PENAL CODE, IN ORDER TO REDUCE PENALTY].[36]Petitioners argue that the refusal of the Ombudsman to conduct a reinvestigation is tantamount to a denial of the right to due process. As Villarin was indicted in the Information despite his not being included in the criminal complaint filed by Pioquinto of the TL Strike Force Team of the DENR, they claim that he was not afforded a preliminary investigation. They also bewail the fact that persons who appear to be equally guilty, such as Sudaria, have not been included in the Information. Hence, they argue that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying their petition for reinvestigation because it deprived Villarin of his right to preliminary investigation and in refusing and to equally prosecute the guilty. They contend that the Ombudsman should not have relied on the prosecutor's Certification[37] contained in the Information to the effect that a preliminary investigation was conducted in the case.Moreover, petitioners contend that the evidence was insufficient to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt since they had no intention to possess the timber and dispose of it for personal gain. They likewise claim that there was failure on the part of the prosecution to present the timber, which were the object of the offense.Our RulingThe petition is unmeritorious.Villarin was properly afforded his right to due process.Records show that the investigating prosecutor received a criminal complaint charging Sudaria, Latayada, Baillo and Boyatac with violation of Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended.[38] The said complaint did not state the known addresses of the accused. Neither was the notarized joint-affidavit of the complainants attached thereto. The subpoena issued to the accused and the copy of their counter-affidavits were also not part of the record. Moreover, the complaint did not include Villarin as a respondent. However, said infirmities do not constitute denial of due process particularly on the part of Villarin.It is evidently clear from the Resolution dated March 13, 1996 of the Office of the City Prosecutor that Villarin and all the accused participated in the scheduled preliminary investigation that was conducted prior to the filing of the criminal case.[39] They knew about the filing of the complaint and even denied any involvement in the illegal cutting of timber. They were also given the opportunity to submit countervailing evidence to convince the investigating prosecutor of their innocence.Foregoing findings considered, there is no factual basis to the assertion that Villarin was not afforded a preliminary investigation. Accordingly, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao in denying Villarin's motion for reconsideration. It validly relied on the certification contained in the Information that a preliminary investigation was properly conducted in this case. The certification was made under oath by no less than the public prosecutor, a public officer who is presumed to have regularly performed his official duty.[40] Besides, it aptly noted that \"Villarin was implicated by x x x Latayada in his affidavit dated January 22, 1996 before Marcelino B. Pioquinto, Chief, Forest Protection and Law Enforcement Unit. The denial of Villarin cannot prevail over the declaration of witnesses.\"[41]Moreover, the absence of a proper preliminary investigation must be timely raised and must not have been waived. This is to allow the trial court to hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the prosecutor to hold a reinvestigation, which, necessarily \"involves a re-examination and re-evaluation of the evidence already submitted by the complainant and the accused, as well as the initial finding of probable cause which led to the filing of the Informations after the requisite preliminary investigation.\"[42]Here, it is conceded that Villarin raised the issue of lack of a preliminary investigation in his Motion for Reinvestigation. However, when the Ombudsman denied the motion, he never raised this issue again. He accepted the Ombudsman's verdict, entered a plea of not guilty during his arraignment and actively participated in the trial on the merits by attending the scheduled hearings, conducting cross-examinations and testifying on his own behalf. It was only after the trial court rendered judgment against him that he once again assailed the conduct of the preliminary investigation in the Motion for Reconsideration.[43] Whatever argument Villarin may have regarding the alleged absence of a preliminary investigation has therefore been mooted. By entering his plea, and actively participating in the trial, he is deemed to have waived his right to preliminary investigation.Petitioners also contend that Sudaria should also have been included as a principal in the commission of the offense. However, whether Sudaria should or should not be included as co-accused can no longer be raised on appeal. Any right that the petitioners may have in questioning the non-inclusion of Sudaria in the Information should have been raised in a motion for reconsideration of the March 13, 1996 Resolution of the Office of the City Prosecutor which recommended the dismissal of the complaint against Sudaria.[44] Having failed to avail of the proper procedural remedy, they are now estopped from assailing his non-inclusion.Two Offenses Penalized Under Sec. 68 of Presidential Decree No. 705.Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended, provides:Section 68. Cutting, Gathering and/or Collecting Timber or Other Forest Products Without License. - Any person who shall cut, gather, collect, remove timber or other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable or disposable public land, or from private land, without any authority, or possess timber or other forest products without legal documents as required under existing forest laws and regulations, shall be punished with the penalties imposed under Articles 309 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code: Provided, that in the case of partnerships, associations, or corporations, the officers who ordered the cutting, gathering, collection or possession shall be liable, and if such officers are aliens, they shall, in addition to the penalty, be deported without further proceedings on the part of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation.\"There are two distinct and separate offenses punished under Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, to wit:(1) Cutting, gathering, collecting and removing timber or other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable or disposable public land, or from private land without any authorization; and(2) Possession of timber or other forest products without the legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations.\"[45]The Information charged petitioners with the second offense which is consummated by the mere possession of forest products without the proper documents.We reviewed the records and hold that the prosecution had discharged theburden of proving all the elements of the offense charged. The evidence of the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners were in custody of timber without the necessary legal documents. Incidentally, we note that several transcripts of stenographic notes (TSNs) were not submitted by the trial court. No explanation was provided for these missing TSNs. Notwithstanding the incomplete TSNs, we still find that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt petitioners' culpability.The prosecution adduced several documents to prove that timber was confiscated from petitioners. It presented a Tally Sheet[46] to prove that the DENR Strike Force Team examined the seized timber on January 13, 1996. The number, volume and appraised value of said timber were also noted in the Tally Sheet. Seizure receipts were also presented to prove that the confiscated timber were placed in the custody of Alarcon[47] and eventually taken to the DENR Office.[48] There was a photograph of the timber taken by the television crew led by Casenas.[49]The prosecution likewise presented in evidence the testimonies of eyewitnesses Granada and Pansacala who testified that Latayada and Boyatac were the ones who delivered the timber.[50]More significantly, Villarin admitted that he was the one who commissioned the procurement of the timber[51] for the repair of the Batinay bridge. He even deputized Boyatac to negotiate with Sudaria and gave Latayada P2,000.00 to transport the logs. Boyatac later informed him of the delivery of timber. However, he could not present any document to show that his possession thereof was legal and pursuant to existing forest laws and regulations.Relevant portions of the testimony of Villarin are as follows: Q As Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, of course, you heard reports prior to the incident on December 31, 1995 that Barangay Captain Camilo Sudaria was also engaged in supplying forest products like forest lumber? A Yes, because I always go to Cagayan de Oro and I can always ride on his jeepney. Q And you were sure that information of yours was received by you and not only by one but several persons from Barangay Tagpangi even up to Barangay Pagalungan? A That's true because he even has a record with the police. Q And you learned [this] prior to January 1995? A Yes, Sir. Q And your information was even to the effect that Sudaria was supplying illegally cut lumber regularly? A What I have noticed because I always ride on his jeep wherein lumber was being loaded, the lumber will be taken when it arrived in Lumbia, kilometer 5. Q Even if there were already raids being conducted to the person of Camilo Sudaria, still he continued to load illegally cut lumber? A He slowed down after several arrest because maybe he was ashamed because he was the Barangay Captain of Tagpangi. Q And his arrest and the slackening of his activities of illegally cut lumber occurred prior to June 1995? A Yes, sir. Q [In spite] of your knowledge that he is engaged [in] illegally cut[ting] forest products, you as Barangay Captain of Pagalungan transacted with him for the purpose of acquiring lumber [for] the bridge at Pagalungan? A As we rode together in his jeep, he informed me that he has some lumber to be used to build his house and he told me he will sell it for the repair of the bridge in Pagalungan. Q And because of that, in addition, you sent him the specifications of materials for the repair of the bridge in Pagalungan? A I let Boyatac go to him and [inquire] from him if he has those specifications. Q And he communicated to you that he has available lumber of those specification? A Yes, because he sent to Boyatac some requirements of the specifications and he let me sign it. Q And after that, you closed the [deal] with Sudaria? A Yes, because I sent somebody to him and we did not talk anymore. Q And thereafter on December 31, 1995, according to your testimony before, Aniano Latayada delivered the lumber flitches you ordered on board the passenger jeep of Camilo Sudaria? A When the specifications were given, we were informed that the lumber were already there. So, it was delivered. Q Who informed you that the lumber were already delivered? A Boyatac. Q And he is referring to those lumber placed alongside the Batinay Bridge. A Yes, Sir. Q And even without personally inspecting it, you immediately paid Latayada the compensation for the delivery of those lumber? A There was already an advance payment for his delivery. Q To whom did you give the advance? A To Latayada. Q You have not given the amount to Camilo Sudaria? A No, Sir. Q In fact, the money that you paid to Latayada was specifically for the transportation of the lumber from Tagpangi to Batinay bridge? A Yes, Sir. PROS. GALARRITA: Q And at that time, you paid Latayada P2,000 as payment of the lumber? A Yes, Sir. COURT: Q Did you pay Latayada? A Yes, Sir. Q How much? A P2,000. Q And you gave this to the conductor? A Yes, Sir. Q You told the conductor to pay the money to Latayada? A Yes, sir. Q What did the conductor say? A The conductor said that the money was for the payment for the transporting of lumber from Tagpangi.[52] (Underscoring ours.) Violation of Sec. 68 of Presidential Decree No. 705, as amended, is malum prohibitum.As a special law, the nature of the offense is malum prohibitum and as such, criminal intent is not an essential element. \"However, the prosecution must prove that petitioners had the intent to possess (animus possidendi)\" the timber.[53] \"Possession, under the law, includes not only actual possession, but also constructive possession. Actual possession exists when the [object of the crime] is in the immediate physical control of the accused. On the other hand, constructive possession exists when the [object of the crime] is under the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found.\"[54]There is no dispute that petitioners were in constructive possession of the timber without the requisite legal documents. Villarin and Latayada were personally involved in its procurement, delivery and storage without any license or permit issued by any competent authority. Given these and considering that the offense is malum prohibitum, petitioners' contention that the possession of the illegally cut timber was not for personal gain but for the repair of said bridge is, therefore, inconsequential.Corpus Delicti is the Fact of the Commission of the CrimePetitioners argue that their convictions were improper because the corpus delicti had not been established. They assert that the failure to present the confiscated timber in court was fatal to the cause of the prosecution.We disagree. \"[C]orpus delicti refers to the fact of the commission of the crime charged or to the body or substance of the crime. In its legal sense, it does not refer to the ransom money in the crime of kidnapping for ransom or to the body of the person murdered\"[55] or, in this case, to the seized timber. \"Since the corpus delicti is the fact of the commission of the crime, this Court has ruled that even a single witness' uncorroborated testimony, if credible, may suffice to prove it and warrant a conviction therefor. Corpus delicti may even be established by circumstantial evidence.\"[56]Here, the trial court and the CA held that the corpus delicti was established by the documentary and testimonial evidence on record. The Tally Sheet, Seizure Receipts issued by the DENR and photograph proved the existence of the timber and its confiscation. The testimonies of the petitioners themselves stating in no uncertain terms the manner in which they consummated the offense they were charged with were likewise crucial to their conviction.We find no reason to deviate from these findings since it has been established that factual findings of a trial court are binding on us, absent any showing that it overlooked or misinterpreted facts or circumstances of weight and substance.[57] The legal precept applies to this case in which the trial court's findings were affirmed by the appellate court.[58]The Proper PenaltyViolation of Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended, is penalized as qualified theft under Article 310 in relation to Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The pertinent portions of these provisions read:Art. 310. Qualified Theft - The crime of theft shall be punished by the penalties next higher by two degrees than those respectively specified in the next preceding articles, if committed by a domestic servant, or with grave abuse of confidence, or if the property stolen is motor vehicle, mail matter or large cattle or consists of coconuts taken from the premises of the plantation or fish taken from a fishpond or fishery, or if property is taken on the occasion of fire, earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption, or any calamity, vehicular accident or civil disturbance.Art. 309. Penalties. - Any person guilty of theft shall be punished by:1. The penalty of prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods, if the value of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; but if the value of the thing stolen exceeds the latter amount, the penalty shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph, and one year for each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be. x x x The Information filed against the petitioners alleged that the 63 pieces of timber without the requisite legal documents measuring 4,326 board feet were valued at P108,150.00. To prove this allegation, the prosecution presented Pioquinto to testify, among others, on this amount. Tally Sheets and Seizure Receipts were also presented to corroborate said amount. With the value of the timber exceeding P22,000.00, the basic penalty is prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods to be imposed in its maximum, the range of which is eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to ten (10) years. Since none of the qualifying circumstances in Article 310 of the RPC was alleged in the Information, the penalty cannot be increased two degrees higher.In determining the additional years of imprisonment, P22,000.00 is to be deducted from P108,150.00, which results to P86,150.00. This remainder must be divided by P10,000.00, disregarding any amount less than P10,000.00. Consequently, eight (8) years must be added to the basic penalty. Thus the maximum imposable penalty ranges from sixteen (16) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to eighteen (18) years of reclusion temporal.Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum imposable penalty should be taken anywhere within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, without considering the modifying circumstances. The penalty one degree lower from prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods is prision correccional in its medium and maximum periods, the range of which is from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to six (6) years. Thus, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, erroneously fixed the minimum period of the penalty at twelve (12) years of prision mayor.Finally, the case against Boyatac must be dismissed considering his demise even before the RTC rendered its Judgment.WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nDEL CASTILLO, J.:\n\nMere possession of timber without the legal documents required under forest laws and regulations makes one automatically liable of violation of Section 68, Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 705, [1] as amended.\u00a0 Lack of criminal intent is not a valid defense.\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari seeks to reverse the June 28, 2005 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 26720 which affirmed in all respects the Judgment [3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 38, Cagayan De Oro City, finding petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 68, P.D. No. 705, as amended.\u00a0 Likewise assailed in this petition\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0 September 22,\u00a0 2006\u00a0 Resolution [4] denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration. [5]\n\nFactual Antecedents\n\nIn a Criminal Complaint [6] filed before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 4, Cagayan de Oro City by Marcelino B. Pioquinto (Pioquinto), Chief of the Forest Protection and Law Enforcement Unit under the TL Strike Force Team of Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), petitioner Aniano Latayada (Latayada) and three others namely, Barangay Captain Camilo Sudaria (Sudaria) of Tagpangi, Cagayan de Oro City, Marlon Baillo (Baillo) and Cipriano Boyatac (Boyatac), were charged with violation of Section 68, P.D. No. 705 as amended by Executive Order No. 277. [7]\n\nSubsequently, however, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Cagayan de Oro City issued a Resolution [8] dated March 13, 1996 recommending the filing of an Information for the aforesaid charge not only against Latayada, Baillo and Boyatac but also against petitioner Crisostomo Villarin (Villarin), then Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City.\u00a0 The dismissal of the complaint against Sudaria was likewise recommended.\u00a0 Said Resolution was then approved by the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao through a Resolution [9] dated May 9, 1996 ordering the filing of the Information in the RTC of Cagayan de Oro City.\n\nThus, on October 29, 1996, an Information [10] was filed against petitioners Villarin and Latayada and their co-accused Baillo and Boyatac, for violation of Section 68, P.D. No. 705 as follows:\n\nThat on or about January 13, 1996, in Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, pursuant to RA 7975, the accused, Crisostomo Villarin, a public officer being the Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, this City, with salary grade below 27, taking advantage of his official position and committing the offense in relation to his office, and the other above-named accused, all private individuals, namely: Marlon Baillo, Cipriano Boyatac, and Aniano Latayada, confederating and mutually helping one another did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously gather and possess sixty-three (63) pieces flitches of varying sizes belonging to the Apitong specie with a total volume of Four Thousand Three Hundred Twenty Six (4,326) board feet valued at P108,150.00, without any authority and supporting documents as required under existing forest laws and regulation to the damage and prejudice of the government.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [11]\n\nOn January 14, 1997, Villarin, Boyatac and Baillo, filed a Motion for Reinvestigation. [12] They alleged that the Joint Affidavit [13] of the personnel of the DENR which became one of the bases in filing the Information never mentioned Villarin as one of the perpetrators of the crime while the accusations against Baillo and Boyatac were not based on the personal knowledge of the affiants.\u00a0 They also asserted that their indictment was based on polluted sources, consisting of the sworn statements of witnesses like Latayada and Sudaria, who both appeared to have participated in the commission of the crime charged.\n\nInstead of resolving the Motion for Reinvestigation, the RTC, in its Order [14] dated January 27, 1997, directed Villarin, Boyatac, and Baillo to file their Motion for Reinvestigation with the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao, it being the entity which filed the Information in Court.\u00a0 On March 31, 1997, only Villarin filed a Petition for Reinvestigation [15] but same was, however, denied by the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao in an Order [16] dated May 15, 1997 because the grounds relied upon were not based on newly discovered evidence or errors of fact, law or irregularities that are prejudicial to the interest of the movants, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 07 or the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman in Criminal Cases. The Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao likewise opined that Villarin was directly implicated by Latayada, his co-accused.\n\nThe RTC thus proceeded with the arraignment of the accused who entered separate pleas of not guilty. [17] Thereafter, trial ensued.\n\nThe Version of the Prosecution\n\nOn December 31, 1995, at around five o'clock in the afternoon, prosecution witness Roland Granada (Granada) noticed that a public utility jeep loaded with timber stopped near his house. The driver, petitioner Latayada, was accompanied by four to five other persons, one of whom was Boyatac while the rest could not be identified by Granada. [18] They alighted from the jeep and unloaded the timber 10 to 15 meters away from the Batinay bridge at Barangay Pagalungan, Cagayan De Oro City.\u00a0 Another prosecution witness, Pastor Pansacala (Pansacala), also noticed the jeep with plate number MBB 226 and owned by Sudaria, loaded with timber. [19] Being then the president of a community-based organization which serves as a watchdog of illegal cutting of trees, [20] Pansacala even ordered a certain Mario Bael to count the timber. [21]\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening of the same day, Barangay Captain Angeles Alarcon (Alarcon) [22] noticed that the pile of timber was already placed near the bridge.\u00a0 Since she had no knowledge of any scheduled repair of the Batinay bridge she was surprised to discover that the timber would be used for the repair.\u00a0 After inquiring from the people living near the bridge, she learned that Latayada and Boyatac delivered the timber. [23]\n\nAnother prosecution witness, Ariel Palanga (Palanga), testified that at seven o'clock in the morning of January 1, 1996, Boyatac bought a stick of cigarette from his store and requested him to cover the pile of timber near the bridge for a fee.\u00a0 Palanga acceded and covered the pile with coconut leaves. [24]\n\nOn January 13, 1996, at around ten o'clock in the morning, prosecution witness Juan Casenas (Casenas), a radio and TV personality of RMN-TV8, took footages of the timber [25] hidden and covered by coconut leaves. Casenas also took footages of more logs inside a bodega at the other side of the bridge. In the following evening, the footages were shown in a news program on television.\n\nOn the same day, members of the DENR Region 10 Strike Force Team measured the timber which consisted of 63 pieces of Apitong flitches and determined that it totaled 4,326 board feet [26] and subsequently entrusted the same to Alarcon for safekeeping.\n\nUpon further investigation, it was learned that the timber was requisitioned by Villarin, who was then Barangay Captain of Pagulangan, Cagayan de Oro City.\u00a0 Villarin gave Sudaria the specifications for the requisitioned timber. Thereafter, Boyatac informed Villarin that the timber was already delivered on December 31, 1995. [27]\n\nOn January 18, 1996, Felix Vera Cruz (Vera Cruz), a security guard at the DENR Region 10 Office, received and signed for the confiscated timber since the property custodian at that time was not around.\n\nThe filing of the aforestated Information followed.\n\nThe Version of the Defense\n\nIn response to the clamor of the residents of Barangays Tampangan, Pigsag-an, Tuburan and Taglinao, all in Cagayan De Oro City, Villarin, decided to repair the impassable Batinay bridge. The project was allegedly with the concurrence of the Barangay Council.\n\nPressured to immediately commence the needed repairs, Villarin commissioned Boyatac to inquire from Sudaria about the availability of timber without first informing the City Engineer. Sudaria asked for the specifications which Villarin gave.\u00a0 Villarin then asked Baillo and Boyatac to attend to the same.\u00a0 When the timber was already available, it was transported from Tagpangi to Batinay.\u00a0 However, the timber flitches were seized by the DENR Strike Force Team and taken to its office where they were received by Vera Cruz, the security guard on duty.\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\n\nIn its Memorandum filed before the trial court, the defense notified the court of Boyatac's demise. [28] However, the trial court did not act on such notice.\u00a0 Instead, it proceeded to rule on the culpability of Boyatac.\u00a0 Thus, in its Judgment, the trial court found herein petitioners and the deceased Boyatac guilty as charged.\u00a0 On the other hand, it found the evidence against Baillo insufficient. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing findings, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Crisostomo Villarin, Cipriano Boyatac and Aniano Latayada guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 68 of Presidential Decree No. 705 as amended, and hereby sentences each of them to suffer an indeterminate sentence of twelve (12) years of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years of reclusion temporal as maximum.\n\nAccused Marlon Baillo is hereby acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nSO ORDERED. [29]\nIn reaching said conclusions, the RTC noted that:\n\nWithout an iota of doubt, accused Crisostomo Villarin, being then a Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City, was the one who procured the subject flitches, while accused Aniano Latayada and Cipriano Boyatac mutually helped him and each other by transporting the flitches from Sitio Batinay to the Pagalungan Bridge. The accused would like to impress upon the Court that the subject fltiches were intended for the repair of the Pagalungan Bridge and were acquired by virtue of Barangay Resolution No. 110 of Barangay Pagalungan. The Court is not impressed by this lame excuse. There is no dispute that the flitches were intended for the repair of the bridge. The Court finds it a laudable motive. The fact remains though that the said forest products were obtained without the necessary authority and legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations. [30]\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration [31] which\u00a0 was\u00a0 denied\u00a0 by\u00a0 the RTC in its Order [32] dated August 20, 2002.\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\n\nPetitioners filed an appeal which was denied by the CA in its Decision dated June 28, 2005.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the judgment of the court a quo finding [d]efendant-[a]ppellants Crisostomo Villarin, Cipriano Boyatac and Aniano Latayada GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violating Sec. 68 of Presidential Decree 705 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto. No pronouncement as to cost.\n\nSO ORDERED. [33]\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration [34] which the appellate court denied for lack of merit in its Resolution [35] promulgated on September 22, 2006.\n\nIssues\n\nUndeterred, petitioners filed the instant petition raising the following issues:\n\nWHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS[,] ON [THE] MATTER OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION[,] DECIDED NOT IN ACCORD WITH JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT;\n\nWHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS DEPARTED FROM WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SAYING, THAT, TO CONVICT AN ACCUSED ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME MUST BE PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT and;\n\nWHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS[,] IN AFFIRMING THE PENALTY IMPOSED BY THE COURT A QUO[,] DEPARTED FROM JURISPRUDENCE THAT EVEN IN CRIMES [INVOLVING] VIOLATION OF SPECIAL LAWS[,] SPECIAL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT [CAN BE CONSIDERED AS MITIGATING HAD THE VIOLATION BEEN PENALIZED UNDER THE REVISED PENAL CODE, IN ORDER TO REDUCE PENALTY]. [36]\nPetitioners argue that the refusal of the Ombudsman to conduct a reinvestigation is tantamount to a denial of the right to due process.\u00a0 As Villarin was indicted in the Information despite his not being included in the criminal complaint filed by Pioquinto of the TL Strike Force Team of the DENR, they claim that he was not afforded a preliminary investigation.\u00a0 They also bewail the fact that persons who appear to be equally guilty, such as Sudaria, have not been included in the Information.\u00a0 Hence, they argue that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying their petition for reinvestigation because it deprived Villarin of his right to preliminary investigation and in refusing and to equally prosecute the guilty.\u00a0 They contend that the Ombudsman should not have relied on the prosecutor's Certification [37] contained in the Information to the effect that a preliminary investigation was conducted in the case.\n\nMoreover, petitioners contend that the evidence was insufficient to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt since they had no intention to possess the timber and dispose of it for personal gain.\u00a0 They likewise claim that there was failure on the part of the prosecution to present the timber, which were the object of the offense.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\n\nVillarin was properly afforded his right\nto due process.\n\nRecords show that the investigating prosecutor received a criminal complaint charging Sudaria, Latayada, Baillo and Boyatac with violation of Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended. [38] The said complaint did not state the known addresses of the accused.\u00a0 Neither was the notarized joint-affidavit of the complainants attached thereto. The subpoena issued to the accused and the copy of their counter-affidavits were also not part of the record.\u00a0 Moreover, the complaint did not include Villarin as a respondent.\u00a0 However, said infirmities do not constitute denial of due process particularly on the part of Villarin.\n\nIt is evidently clear from the Resolution dated March 13, 1996 of the Office of the City Prosecutor that Villarin and all the accused participated in the scheduled preliminary investigation that was conducted prior to the filing of the criminal case. [39] They knew about the filing of the complaint and even denied any involvement in the illegal cutting of timber.\u00a0 They were also given the opportunity to submit countervailing evidence to convince the investigating prosecutor of their innocence.\n\nForegoing findings considered, there is no factual basis to the assertion that Villarin was not afforded a preliminary investigation. Accordingly, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao in denying Villarin's motion for reconsideration.\u00a0 It validly relied on the certification contained in the Information that a preliminary investigation was properly conducted in this case.\u00a0 The certification was made under oath by no less than the public prosecutor, a public officer who is presumed to have regularly performed his official duty. [40] Besides, it aptly noted that \"Villarin was implicated by x x x Latayada in his affidavit dated January 22, 1996 before Marcelino B. Pioquinto, Chief, Forest Protection and Law Enforcement Unit.\u00a0 The denial of Villarin cannot prevail over the declaration of witnesses.\" [41]\n\nMoreover, the absence of a proper preliminary investigation must be timely raised and must not have been waived.\u00a0 This is to allow the trial court to hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the prosecutor to hold a reinvestigation, which, necessarily \"involves a re-examination and re-evaluation of the evidence already submitted by the complainant and the accused, as well as the initial finding of probable cause which led to the filing of the Informations after the requisite preliminary investigation.\" [42]\n\nHere, it is conceded that Villarin raised the issue of lack of a preliminary investigation in his Motion for Reinvestigation.\u00a0 However, when the Ombudsman denied the motion, he never raised this issue again.\u00a0 He accepted the Ombudsman's verdict, entered a plea of not guilty during his arraignment and actively participated in the trial on the merits by attending the scheduled hearings, conducting cross-examinations and testifying on his own behalf.\u00a0 It was only after the trial court rendered judgment against him that he once again assailed the conduct of the preliminary investigation in the Motion for Reconsideration. [43] Whatever argument Villarin may have regarding the alleged absence of a preliminary investigation has therefore been mooted.\u00a0 By entering his plea, and actively participating in the trial, he is deemed to have waived his right to preliminary investigation.\n\nPetitioners also contend that Sudaria should also have been included as a principal in the commission of the offense.\u00a0 However, whether Sudaria should or should not be included as co-accused can no longer be raised on appeal.\u00a0 Any right that the petitioners may have in questioning the non-inclusion of Sudaria in the Information should have been raised in a motion for reconsideration of the March 13, 1996 Resolution of the Office of the City Prosecutor which recommended the dismissal of the complaint against\u00a0 Sudaria. [44] Having\u00a0 failed to avail of\u00a0 the proper procedural remedy, they are now estopped from assailing his non-inclusion.\n\nTwo Offenses Penalized Under Sec. 68\nof Presidential Decree No. 705.\n\nSection 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended, provides:\n\nSection 68. Cutting, Gathering and/or Collecting Timber or Other Forest Products Without License. - Any person who shall cut, gather, collect, remove timber or other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable or disposable public land, or from private land, without any authority, or possess timber or other forest products without legal documents as required under existing forest laws and regulations, shall be punished with the penalties imposed under Articles 309 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code: Provided, that in the case of partnerships, associations, or corporations, the officers who ordered the cutting, gathering, collection or possession shall be liable, and if such officers are aliens, they shall, in addition to the penalty, be deported without further proceedings on the part of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation.\n\"There are two distinct and separate offenses punished under Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, to wit:\n\n(1) Cutting, gathering, collecting and removing timber or other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable or disposable public land, or from private land without any authorization; and\n\n(2) Possession of timber or other forest products without the legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations.\" [45]\n\nThe Information charged petitioners with the second offense which is consummated by the mere possession of forest products without the proper documents.\n\nWe reviewed the records and hold\u00a0 that the prosecution had\u00a0 discharged the\n\nburden of proving all the elements of the offense charged. The evidence of the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners were in custody of timber without the necessary legal documents.\u00a0 Incidentally, we note that several transcripts of stenographic notes (TSNs) were not submitted by the trial court.\u00a0 No explanation was provided for these missing TSNs.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the incomplete TSNs, we still find that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt petitioners' culpability.\n\nThe prosecution adduced several documents to prove that timber was confiscated from petitioners.\u00a0 It presented a Tally Sheet [46] to prove that the DENR Strike Force Team examined the seized timber on January 13, 1996.\u00a0 The number, volume and appraised value of said timber were also noted in the Tally Sheet.\u00a0 Seizure receipts were also presented to prove that the confiscated timber were placed in the custody of Alarcon [47] and eventually taken to the DENR Office. [48] There was a photograph of the timber taken by the television crew led by Casenas. [49]\n\nThe prosecution likewise presented in evidence the testimonies of eyewitnesses Granada and Pansacala who testified that Latayada and Boyatac were the ones who delivered the timber. [50]\n\nMore significantly, Villarin admitted that he was the one who commissioned the procurement of the timber [51] for the repair of the Batinay bridge.\u00a0 He even deputized Boyatac to negotiate with Sudaria and gave Latayada P2,000.00 to transport the logs.\u00a0 Boyatac later informed him of the delivery of timber.\u00a0 However, he could not present any document to show that his possession thereof was legal and pursuant to existing forest laws and regulations.\n\nRelevant portions of the testimony of Villarin are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ | As Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, of course, you heard reports prior to the incident on December 31, 1995 thatBarangay Captain Camilo Sudaria was also engaged in supplying forest products like forest lumber?\nA | Yes, because I always go to Cagayan de Oro and I can always ride on his jeepney.\n | \nQ | And you were sure that information of yours was received by you and not only by one but several persons from Barangay Tagpangi even up to Barangay Pagalungan?\nA | That's true becausehe even has a record with the police.\n | \nQ | And you learned [this] prior to January 1995?\nA | Yes, Sir.\n | \nQ | And your information was even to the effect thatSudaria was supplying illegally cut lumber regularly?\nA | What I have noticed because I always ride on his jeep wherein lumber was being loaded,the lumber will be taken when it arrived in Lumbia, kilometer 5.\n | \nQ | Even if there were already raids being conducted to the person of Camilo Sudaria,still he continued to load illegally cut lumber?\nA | Heslowed down after several arrest because maybe he was ashamed because he was the Barangay Captain of Tagpangi.\n | \nQ | And his arrest and the slackening of his activities of illegally cut lumber occurred prior to June 1995?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | [In spite] of your knowledge that he is engaged [in] illegally cut[ting] forest products, you as Barangay Captain of Pagalungan transacted with him for the purpose of acquiring lumber [for] the bridge at Pagalungan?\nA | As we rode together in his jeep, he informed me thathe has some lumber to be used to build his house and he told me he will sell it for the repair of the bridge in Pagalungan.\n | \nQ | And because of that, in addition, you sent him the specifications of materials for the repair of the bridge in Pagalungan?\nA | I let Boyatac go to him and [inquire] from him if he has those specifications.\n | \nQ | And he communicated to you thathe has available lumber of those specification?\nA | Yes, because he sent to Boyatac some requirements of the specifications and he let me sign it.\n | \nQ | And after that, you closed the [deal] with Sudaria?\nA | Yes,because I sent somebody to him and we did not talk anymore.\n | \nQ | And thereafter on December 31, 1995, according to your testimony before, Aniano Latayada delivered the lumber flitches you ordered on board the passenger jeep of Camilo Sudaria?\nA | When the specifications were given, we were informed that the lumber were already there.

A Yes , because I always go to Cagayan de Oro and I can always ride on his jeepney. Q And you were sure that information of yours was received by you and not only by one but several persons from Barangay Tagpangi even up to Barangay Pagalungan? A That's true because he even has a record with the police . Q And you learned [this] prior to January 1995? A Yes, Sir. Q And your information was even to the effect that Sudaria was supplying illegally cut lumber regularly ? A What I have noticed because I always ride on his jeep wherein lumber was being loaded, the lumber will be taken when it arrived in Lumbia, kilometer 5 . Q Even if there were already raids being conducted to the person of Camilo Sudaria, still he continued to load illegally cut lumber ? A He slowed down after several arrest because maybe he was ashamed because he was the Barangay Captain of Tagpangi . Q And his arrest and the slackening of his activities of illegally cut lumber occurred prior to June 1995? A Yes, sir. Q [In spite] of your knowledge that he is engaged [in] illegally cut[ting] forest products, you as Barangay Captain of Pagalungan transacted with him for the purpose of acquiring lumber [for] the bridge at Pagalungan? A As we rode together in his jeep, he informed me that he has some lumber to be used to build his house and he told me he will sell it for the repair of the bridge in Pagalungan. Q And because of that, in addition, you sent him the specifications of materials for the repair of the bridge in Pagalungan? A I let Boyatac go to him and [inquire] from him if he has those specifications. Q And he communicated to you that he has available lumber of those specification ? A Yes, because he sent to Boyatac some requirements of the specifications and he let me sign it. Q And after that, you closed the [deal] with Sudaria? A Yes, because I sent somebody to him and we did not talk anymore. Q And thereafter on December 31, 1995, according to your testimony before, Aniano Latayada delivered the lumber flitches you ordered on board the passenger jeep of Camilo Sudaria? A When the specifications were given, we were informed that the lumber were already there. So, it was delivered. Q Who informed you that the lumber were already delivered? A Boyatac. Q And he is referring to those lumber placed alongside the Batinay Bridge. A Yes, Sir. Q And even without personally inspecting it, you immediately paid Latayada the compensation for the delivery of those lumber ? A There was already an advance payment for his delivery. Q To whom did you give the advance? A To Latayada. Q You have not given the amount to Camilo Sudaria? A No, Sir. Q In fact, the money that you paid to Latayada was specifically for the transportation of the lumber from Tagpangi to Batinay bridge? A Yes, Sir. PROS. GALARRITA: Q And at that time, you paid Latayada P2,000 as payment of the lumber ? A Yes, Sir. COURT: Q Did you pay Latayada? A Yes, Sir. Q How much? A P2,000. Q And you gave this to the conductor? A Yes, Sir. Q You told the conductor to pay the money to Latayada ? A Yes, sir. Q What did the conductor say? A\n\nThe conductor said that the money was for the payment for the transporting of lumber from Tagpangi . [52] (Underscoring ours.)\nViolation of Sec. 68 of Presidential Decree\nNo.\u00a0\u00a0 705,\u00a0\u00a0 as\u00a0\u00a0 amended, is\nmalum prohibitum.\n\nAs a special law, the nature of the offense is malum prohibitum and as such, criminal intent is not an essential element.\u00a0 \"However, the prosecution must prove that petitioners had the intent to possess ( animus possidendi )\" the timber. [53] \"Possession, under the law, includes not only actual possession, but also constructive possession.\u00a0 Actual possession exists when the [object of the crime] is in the immediate physical control of the accused.\u00a0 On the other hand, constructive possession exists when the [object of the crime] is under the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found.\" [54]\n\nThere is no dispute that petitioners were in constructive possession of\u00a0 the timber without the requisite legal documents.\u00a0 Villarin and Latayada were personally involved in its procurement, delivery and storage without any license or permit issued by any competent authority.\u00a0 Given these and considering that the offense is malum prohibitum, petitioners' contention that the possession of the illegally cut timber was not for personal gain but for the repair of said bridge is, therefore, inconsequential.\n\nCorpus Delicti is the Fact of the\nCommission of the Crime\n\nPetitioners argue that their convictions were improper because the corpus delicti had not been established. They assert that the failure to present the confiscated timber in court was fatal to the cause of the prosecution.\n\nWe disagree.\u00a0 \"[ C ] orpus delicti refers to the fact of the commission of the crime charged or to the body or substance of the crime.\u00a0 In its legal sense, it does not refer to the ransom money in the crime of kidnapping for ransom or to the body of the person murdered\" [55] or, in this case, to the seized timber.\u00a0 \"Since the corpus delicti is the fact of the commission of the crime, this Court has ruled that even a single witness' uncorroborated testimony, if credible, may suffice to prove it and warrant a conviction therefor. Corpus delicti may even be established by circumstantial evidence.\" [56]\n\nHere, the trial court and the CA held that the corpus delicti was established by the documentary and testimonial evidence on record.\u00a0 The Tally Sheet, Seizure Receipts issued by the DENR and photograph proved the existence of the timber and its confiscation. The testimonies of the petitioners themselves stating in no uncertain terms the manner in which they consummated the offense they were charged with were likewise crucial to their conviction.\n\nWe find no reason to deviate from these findings since it has been established that factual findings of a trial court are binding on us, absent any showing that it overlooked or misinterpreted facts or circumstances of weight and substance. [57] The legal precept applies to this case in which the trial court's findings were affirmed by the appellate court. [58]\n\nThe Proper Penalty\n\nViolation of Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended, is penalized as qualified theft under Article 310 in relation to Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).\u00a0\u00a0 The pertinent portions of these provisions read:\n\nArt. 310. Qualified Theft - The crime of theft shall be punished by the penalties next higher by two degrees than those respectively specified in the next preceding articles, if committed by a domestic servant, or with grave abuse of confidence, or if the property stolen is motor vehicle, mail matter or large cattle or consists of coconuts taken from the premises of the plantation or fish taken from a fishpond or fishery, or if property is taken on the occasion of fire, earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption, or any calamity, vehicular accident or civil disturbance.\n\nArt. 309. Penalties . - Any person guilty of theft shall be punished by:\n\n1. The penalty of prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods, if the value of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; but if the value of the thing stolen exceeds the latter amount, the penalty shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph, and one year for each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal , as the case may be.\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\n\nThe Information filed against the petitioners alleged that the 63 pieces of timber without the requisite legal documents measuring 4,326 board feet were valued at P108,150.00.\u00a0 To prove this allegation, the prosecution presented Pioquinto to testify, among others, on this amount. Tally Sheets and Seizure Receipts were also presented to corroborate said amount.\u00a0 With the value of the timber exceeding P22,000.00, the basic penalty is prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods to be imposed in its maximum, the range of which is eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to ten (10) years.\u00a0 Since none of the qualifying circumstances in Article 310 of the RPC was alleged in the Information, the penalty cannot be increased two degrees higher.\n\nIn determining the additional years of imprisonment, P22,000.00 is to be deducted from P108,150.00, which results to P86,150.00.\u00a0 This remainder must be divided by P10,000.00, disregarding any amount less than P10,000.00.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, eight (8) years must be added to the basic penalty.\u00a0 Thus the maximum imposable penalty ranges from sixteen (16) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to eighteen (18) years of reclusion temporal.\n\nApplying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum imposable penalty should be taken anywhere within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, without considering the modifying circumstances.\u00a0 The penalty one degree lower from prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods is prision correccional in its medium and maximum periods, the range of which is from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.\u00a0 Thus, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, erroneously fixed the minimum period of the penalty at twelve (12) years of prision mayor.\n\nFinally, the case against Boyatac must be dismissed considering his demise even before the RTC rendered its Judgment.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED .\u00a0 The assailed Decision dated June 28, 2005 and the Resolution dated September 22, 2006 in CA-G.R. CR No. 26720 are AFFIRMED with the modificationS that petitioners Crisostomo Villarin and Aniano Latayada are each sentenced to suffer imprisonment of two (2) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of prision correccional , as minimum, to sixteen (16) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal , as maximum.\u00a0 The complaint against Cipriano Boyatac is hereby DISMISSED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCorona, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, and Villarama, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Revised Forestry Code of the Philippines.\n\n[2] CA rollo , pp. 135-148; penned by Associate Justice Normandie B.

      "title": "PETRONILO J. BARAYUGA, PETITIONER, VS. ADVENTIST UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES, THROUGH ITS BOARD OF TRUSTEES, REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRMAN, NESTOR D. DAYSON, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N BERSAMIN, J.: The injunctive relief protects only a right in esse. Where the plaintiff does not demonstrate that he has an existing right to be protected by injunction, his suit for injunction must be dismissed for lack of a cause of action.The dispute centers on whether the removal of the petitioner as President of respondent Adventist University of the Philippines (AUP) was valid, and whether his term in that office was five years, as he insists, or only two years, as AUP insists.We hereby review the decision promulgated on August 5, 2004,[1] by which the Court of Appeals (CA) nullified and set aside the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 21, in Imus, Cavite to prevent AUP from removing the petitioner.AntecedentsAUP, a non-stock and non-profit domestic educational institution incorporated under Philippine laws on March 3, 1932, was directly under the North Philippine Union Mission (NPUM) of the Southern Asia Pacific Division of the Seventh Day Adventists. During the 3rd Quinquennial Session of the General Conference of Seventh Day Adventists held from November 27, 2000 to December 1, 2000, the NPUM Executive Committee elected the members of the Board of Trustees of AUP, including the Chairman and the Secretary. Respondent Nestor D. Dayson was elected Chairman while the petitioner was chosen Secretary.On January 23, 2001, almost two months following the conclusion of the 3rd Quinquennial Session, the Board of Trustees appointed the petitioner President of AUP.[2] During his tenure, or from November 11 to November 13, 2002, a group from the NPUM conducted an external performance audit. The audit revealed the petitioner's autocratic management style, like making major decisions without the approval or recommendation of the proper committees, including the Finance Committee; and that he had himself done the canvassing and purchasing of materials and made withdrawals and reimbursements for expenses without valid supporting receipts and without the approval of the Finance Committee. The audit concluded that he hadcommitted serious violations of fundamental rules and procedure in the disbursement and use of funds.The NPUM Executive Committee and the Board of Trustees decided to immediately request the services of the General Conference Auditing Service (GCAS) to determine the veracity of the audit findings. Accordingly, GCAS auditors worked in the campus from December 4 to December 20, 2002 to review the petitioner's transactions during the period from April 2002 to October 2002. On December 20, 2002, CGAS auditors reported the results of their review, and submitted their observations and recommendations to the Board of Trustees.Upon receipt of the CGAS report that confirmed the initial findings of the auditors on January 8, 2003, the NPUM informed the petitioner of the findings and required him to explain.On January 15, 2003, Chairman Dayson and the NPUM Treasurer likewise informed the petitioner inside the NPUM office on the findings of the auditors in the presence of the AUP Vice-President for Financial Affairs, and reminded him of the possible consequences should he fail to satisfactorily explain the irregularities cited in the report. He replied that he had already prepared his written explanation.The Board of Trustees set a special meeting at 2 p.m. on January 22, 2003. Being the Secretary, the petitioner himself prepared the agenda and included an item on his case. In that meeting, he provided copies of the auditors' report and his answers to the members of the Board of Trustees. After hearing his explanations and oral answers to the questions raised on issues arising from the report, the members of the Board of Trustees requested him to leave to allow them to analyze and evaluate the report and his answers. Despite a long and careful deliberation, however, the members of the Board of Trustees decided to adjourn that night and to set another meeting in the following week considering that the meeting had not been specifically called for the purpose of deciding his case. The adjournment would also allow the Board of Trustees more time to ponder on the commensurate disciplinary measure to be meted on him.On January 23, 2003, Chairman Dayson notified the petitioner in writing that the Board of Trustees would hold in abeyance its deliberation on his answer to the auditors' report and would meet again at 10:00 a.m. on January 27, 2003. Chairman Dayson indicated that some sectors in the campus had not been properly represented in the January 22, 2003 special meeting, and requested the petitioner as Secretary to ensure that all sectors are duly represented in the next meeting of the Board of Trustees.[3]In the January 27, 2003 special meeting, the petitioner sent a letter to the Board of Trustees. The members, by secret ballot, voted to remove him as President because of his serious violations of fundamental rules and procedures in the disbursement and use of funds as revealed by the special audit; to appoint an interim committee consisting of three members to assume the powers and functions of the President; and to recommend him to the NPUM for consideration as Associate Director for Secondary Education.[4]On January 28, 2003, the petitioner was handed inside the NPUM office a letter, together with a copy of the minutes of the special meeting held the previous day. In turn, he handed to Chairman Dayson a letter requesting two weeks within which to seek a reconsideration, stating that he needed time to obtain supporting documents because he was then attending to his dying mother.[5]In the evening of January 28, 2003, the Board of Trustees, most of whose members had not yet left Cavite, reconvened to consider and decide the petitioner's request for reconsideration. During the meeting, he made an emotional appeal to allow him to continue as President, promising to immediately vacate his office should he again commit any of the irregularities cited in the auditors' report. He added that should the Board of Trustees not favor his appeal, he would settle for a retirement package for him and his wife and would leave the church.The Board of Trustees denied the petitioner's request for reconsideration because his reasons were not meritorious. Board Member Elizabeth Role served the notice of the denial on him the next day, but he refused to receive the notice, simply saying Alam ko na yan.[6]The petitioner later obtained a copy of the inter-school memorandum dated January 31, 2003 informing AUP students, staff, and faculty members about his relief as President and the appointment of an interim committee to assume the powers and duties of the President.On February 4, 2003, the petitioner brought his suit for injunction and damages in the RTC, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), impleading AUP and its Board of Trustees, represented by Chairman Dayson, and the interim committee. His complaint alleged that the Board of Trustees had relieved him as President without valid grounds despite his five-year term; that the Board of Trustees had thereby acted in bad faith; and that his being denied ample and reasonable time to present his evidence deprived him of his right to due process.[7]The suit being intra-corporate and summary in nature, the application for TRO was heard by means of affidavits. In the hearing of February 7, 2003, the parties agreed not to harass each other. The RTC used the mutual agreement as its basis to issue a status quo order on February 11, 2003.[8]In their answer with counterclaim, the respondents denied the allegations of the petitioner, and averred that he had been validly removed for cause; and that he had been granted ample opportunity to be heard in his defense.[9]Order of the RTCOn March 21, 2003, after summary hearing, the RTC issued the TRO enjoining the respondents and persons acting for and in their behalf from implementing the resolution removing him as President issued by the Board of Trustees during the January 27, 2003 special meeting, and enjoining the interim committee from performing the functions of President of AUP. The RTC did not require a bond.[10]After further hearing, the RTC issued on April 25, 2003 its controversial order,[11] granting the petitioner's application for a writ of preliminary injunction. It thereby resolved three issues, namely: (a) whether the special board meetings were valid; (b) whether the conflict-of-interest provision in the By-Laws and Working Policy was violated; and (c) whether the petitioner was denied due process. It found for the petitioner upon all the issues. On the first issue, it held that there was neither a written request made by any two members of the Board of Trustees nor proper notices sentto the members as required by AUP's By-Laws, which omissions, being patent defects, tainted the special board meetings with nullity. Anent the second issue, it ruled that the purchase of coco lumber from his balae (i.e., mother-in-law of his son) was not covered by the conflict-of-interest provision, for AUP's Model Statement of Acceptance form mentioned only the members of the immediate family and did not extend to the relationship between him and his balae. On the third issue, it concluded that he was deprived of due process when the Board of Trustees refused to grant his motion for reconsideration and his request for additional time to produce his evidence, and instead immediately implemented its decision by relieving him from his position without according him the treatment befitting a university President.Proceedings in the CAWith the Interim Rules for Intra-Corporate Controversies prohibiting a motion for reconsideration, the respondents forthwith filed a petition for certiorari in the CA,[12] contending that the petitioner's complaint did not meet the requirement that an injunctive writ should be anchored on a legal right; and that he had been merely appointed, not elected, as President for a term of office of only two years, not five years, based on AUP's amended By-Laws.In the meanwhile, on September 17, 2003, the petitioner filed a supplemental petition in the CA,[13] alleging that after the commencement of his action, he filed in the RTC an urgent motion for the issuance of a second TRO to enjoin the holding of an AUP membership meeting and the election of a new Board of Trustees, capitalizing on the admission in the respondents' answer that he had been elected in 2001 to a five-year term of office. He argued that the admission estopped the respondents from insisting to the contrary.The respondents filed in the CA a verified urgent motion for a TRO and to set a hearing on the application for preliminary injunction to enjoin the RTC from implementing the assailed order granting a writ of preliminary injunction and from further proceeding in the case. The petitioner opposed the motion for TRO, but did not object to the scheduling of preliminary injunctive hearings.On February 24, 2004, the CA issued a TRO to enjoin the RTC from proceeding for a period of 60 days, and declared that the prayer for injunctive relief would be resolved along with the merits of the main case.The petitioner sought a clarification of the TRO issued by the CA, considering that his cause of action in his petitions to cite the respondents in indirect contempt dated March 5, 2004 and March 16, 2004 filed in the RTC involved the election of a certain Robin Saban as the new President of AUP in blatant and malicious violation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC. In clarifying the TRO, the CA explained that it did not go beyond the reliefs prayed for in the respondents' motion for TRO and preliminary injunctive hearings.On August 5, 2004, the CA rendered its decision nullifying the RTC's writ of preliminary injunction. It rejected the petitioner's argument that Article IV, Section 3 of AUP's Constitution and By-Laws and Working Policy of the Conference provided a five-year term for him, because the provision was inexistent. It ruled that the petitioner's term of office had expired on January 22, 2003, or two years from his appointment, based on AUP's amended By-Laws; that, consequently, he had been a mere de facto officer appointed by the members of the Board of Trustees; and that he held no legal right warranting the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction.The CA declared that the rule on judicial admissions admitted of exceptions, as held in National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals,[14] where the Court held that admissions were not evidence that prevailed over documentary proof; that the petitioner's being able to answer the results of the special audit point-by-point belied his allegation of denial of due process; that AUP was the party that stood to be injured by the issuance of the injunctive writ in the form of a \"demoralized administration, studentry, faculty and staff, sullied reputation, and dishonest leadership;\" and that the assailed RTC order sowed confusion and chaos because the RTC thereby chose to subordinate the interest of the entire AUP community to that of the petitioner who had been deemed not to have satisfied the highest ideals required of his office.IssuesUndeterred, the petitioner has appealed, contending that:I.THE COURT OF APPPEALS HAS DECIDED CONTRARY TO LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT RULED THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY WRIT OF CERTIORARI APPLIED IN THE CASE AT BAR.II.THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE ESTABLISHED LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE THAT \"ADMISSIONS, VERBAL OR WRITTEN, MADE BY A PARTY IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE SAME CASE, DOES NOT REQUIRE PROOF,\" BY REQUIRING PETITIONER BARAYUGA TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT HIS TERM AS PRESIDENT OF AUP IS FOR FIVE (5) YEARS.III.THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED FACTS WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER BARAYUGA HAS ONLY A TERM OF TWO (2) YEARS INSTEAD OF FIVE (5) YEARS AS CLEARLY ADMITTED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT AUP IN ITS ANSWER.IV.THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE BY SOLELY RELYING ON THE CASE OF NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS, WHICH INVOLVE FACTS DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT CASE.V.THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED FACTS WHEN IT UNJUSTIFIABLY ALLOWED THE WAIVER OF NOTICE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.VI.THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED FACTS WHEN IT ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDED THAT PETITIONER BARAYUGA WAS MERELY OCCUPYING THE POSITION OF AUP PRESIDENT IN A HOLD-OVER CAPACITY.The petitioner argues that the assailed RTC order, being supported by substantial evidence, accorded with law and jurisprudence; that his tenure as President under the Constitution, By-Laws and the Working Policy of the Conference was for five years, contrary to the CA's findings that he held the position in a hold-over capacity; that instead, the CA should have applied the rule on judicial admission, because the holding in National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals, cited by the CA, did not apply, due to AUP not having presented competent evidence to prove that he had not been elected by the Board of Trustees as President of AUP; and that his removal during the special board meeting that was invalidly held for lack of notice denied him due process.AUP counters that:IPETITIONER IS NOT AN ELECTED TRUSTEE OF THE AUP BOARD, NOR WAS (HE) ELECTED AS PRESIDENT, AND AS SUCH, HE CAN CLAIM NO RIGHT TO THE AUP PRESIDENCY, BEING TWICE DISQUALIFIED BY LAW, WHICH RENDERS MOOT AND ACAMEDIC ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS IN THIS PETITION.IIEVEN IF WE FALSELY ASSUME EX GRATIA THAT PETITIONER IS AN ELECTED TRUSTEE AND ELECTED PRESIDENT, THE TWO (2) YEAR TERM PROVIDED IN AUP'S BY-LAWS - REQUIRED BY THE CORPORATION CODE AND APPROVED BY THE SEC - IS WHAT GOVERNS THE INTRA-CORPORATE CONTROVERSY, THE AUP'S ADMISSION IN ITS ANSWER THAT HE HAS A FIVE (5) YEAR TERM BASED ON HIS INVOKED SAMPLE CONSTITUTION, BY-LAWS AND POLICY OF THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST NOTWITHSTANDING.IIIPURSUANT TO THE RULES AND SETTLED JURISPRUDENCE, THE ADMISSION IN THE ANSWER IS NOT EVEN PREJUDICIAL AT ALL.IVEVEN IF WE FALSELY ASSUME, JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, THAT THE PETITIONER HAD A FIVE (5) YEAR TERM AS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT, HE WAS NONETHELESS VALIDLY TERMINATED FOR LOSS OF CONFIDENCE, GIVEN THE NUMEROUS ADMITTED ANOMALIES HE COMMITTED.VPETITIONER CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT NOTICES OF THE BOARD MEETING WERE NOT SENT TO ALL \"THE TWENTY FIVE (25) TRUSTEES OF THE AUP BOARD\", SINCE: [1] AS THE AUP SECRETARY, IT WAS HE WHO HAD THE DUTY TO SEND THE NOTICES; [2] WORSE, HE ATTENDED AND EXHAUSTIVELY DEFENDED HIS WRITTEN ANSWER IN THE AUP BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING, THUS, WAIVING ANY \"NOTICE OBJECTION\"; [3] WORST OF ALL, HIS AFTERTHOUGHT OBJECTION IS DECEPTIVELY FALSE IN FACT.The decisive question is whether the CA correctly ruled that the petitioner had no legal right to the position of President of AUP that could be protected by the injunctive writ issued by the RTC.RulingWe deny the petition for review for lack of merit.1.Petition is already mootThe injunctive writ issued by the RTC was meant to protect the petitioner's right to stay in office as President. Given that the lifetime of the writ of preliminary injunction was co-extensive with the duration of the act sought to be prohibited,[15] this injunctive relief already became moot in the face of the admission by the petitioner himself, through his affidavit,[16] that his term of office premised on his alleged five-year tenure as President had lasted only until December 2005. In short, the injunctive writ granted by the RTC had expired upon the end of the term of office (as posited by him).The mootness of the petition warranted its denial. When the resolution of the issue submitted in a case has become moot and academic, and the prayer of the complaint or petition, even if granted, has become impossible of enforcement - for there is nothing more to enjoin - the case should be dismissed.[17] No useful purpose would then be served by passing on the merits of the petition, because any ruling could hardly be of any practical or useful purpose in the premises. It is a settled rule that a court will not determine a moot question or an abstract proposition, nor express an opinion in a case in which no practical relief can be granted.[18] Indeed, moot and academic cases cease to present any justiciable controversies by virtue of supervening events,[19] and the courts of law will not determine moot questions,[20] for the courts should not engage in academic declarations and determine a moot question.[21]2.RTC acted in patently grave abuse of discretionin issuing the TRO and writ of injunctionNonetheless, the aspect of the case concerning the petitioner's claim for damages has still to be decided. It is for this reason that we have to resolve whether or not the petitioner had a right to the TRO and the injunctive writ issued by the RTC.A valid writ of preliminary injunction rests on the weight of evidence submitted by the plaintiff establishing: (a) a present and unmistakable right to be protected; (b) the acts against which the injunction is directed violate such right; and (c) a special and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages.[22] In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive writ constitutes grave abuse of discretion[23] and will result to nullification thereof. Where the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage sans proof of an actual existing right is not a ground for a preliminary injunction.[24]It is clear to us, based on the foregoing principles guiding the issuance of the TRO and the writ of injunction, that the issuance of the assailed order constituted patently grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC, and that the CA rightly set aside the order of the RTC.To begin with, the petitioner rested his claim for injunction mainly upon his representation that he was entitled to serve for five years as President of AUP under the Constitution, By-Laws and Working Policy of the General Conference of the Seventh Day Adventists (otherwise called the Bluebook). All that he presented in that regard, however, were mere photocopies of pages 225-226 of the Bluebook, which read:Article IV-Board of DirectorsSec. 1. This school operated by the _____________ Union Conference/Mission of Seventh-Day Adventists shall be under the direct control of a board of directors, elected by the constituency in its quinquennial sessions. The board of directors shall consist of 15 to 21 members, depending on the size of the institution. Ex officio members shall be the union president as chairperson, the head of the school as secretary, the union secretary, the union treasurer, the union director of education, the presidents of the conferences/missions within the union. xxx.Sec. 2. The term of office of members of the board of directors shall be five years to coincide with the ______________ Union Conference/Mission quinquennial period.Sec. 3. The duties of the board of directors shall be to elect quinquenially the president, xxx.Yet, the document had no evidentiary value. It had not been officially adopted for submission to and approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was nothing but an unfilled model form. As such, it was, at best, only a private document that could not be admitted as evidence in judicial proceedings until it was first properly authenticated in court.Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court requires authentication as a condition for the admissibility of a private document, to wit:Section 20. Proof of private document. - Before any private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved either:(a) By anyone who saw the document executed or written; or(b) By evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.Any other private document need only be identified as that which it is claimed to be. (21 a)For the RTC to base its issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction on the mere photocopies of the document, especially that such document was designed to play a crucial part in the resolution of the decisive issue on the length of the term of office of the petitioner, was gross error.Secondly, even assuming that the petitioner had properly authenticated the photocopies of the Bluebook, the provisions contained therein did not vest the right to an office in him. An unfilled model form creates or establishes no rights in favor of anyone.Thirdly, the petitioner's assertion of a five-year duration for his term of office lacked legal basis.Section 108 of the Corporation Code determines the membership and number of trustees in an educational corporation, viz:Section 108. Board of trustees. - Trustees of educational institutions organized as educational corporations shall not be less than five (5) nor more than fifteen (15): Provided, however, That the number of trustees shall be in multiples of five (5).Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or the by-laws, the board of trustees of incorporated schools, colleges, or other institutions of learning shall, as soon as organized, so classify themselves that the term of office of one-fifth (1/5) of their number shall expire every year. Trustees thereafter elected to fill vacancies, occurring before the expiration of a particular term, shall hold office only for the unexpired period. Trustees elected thereafter to fill vacancies caused by expiration of term shall hold office for five (5) years. A majority of the trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The powers and authority of trustees shall be defined in the by-laws.For institutions organized as stock corporations, the number and term of directors shall be governed by the provisions on stock corporations.The second paragraph of the provision, although setting the term of the members of the Board of Trustees at five years, contains a proviso expressly subjecting the duration to what is otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the educational corporation. That contrary provision controls on the term of office.[25]In AUP's case, its amended By-Laws provided the term of the members of the Board of Trustees, and the period within which to elect the officers, thusly:Article IBoard of TrusteesSection 1. At the first meeting of the members of the corporation, and thereafter every two years, a Board of Trustees shall be elected. It shall be composed of fifteen members in good and regular standing in the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, each of whom shall hold his office for a term of two years, or until his successor has been elected and qualified. If a trustee ceases at any time to be a member in good and regular standing in the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, he shall thereby cease to be a trustee.xxxxArticle IVOfficersSection 1. Election of officers. - At their organization meeting, the members of the Board of Trustees shall elect from among themselves a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, a President, a Secretary, a Business Manager, and a Treasurer. The same persons may hold and perform the duties of more than one office, provided they are not incompatible with each other.[26]In light of foregoing, the members of the Board of Trustees were to serve a term of office of only two years; and the officers, who included the President, were to be elected from among the members of the Board of Trustees during their organizational meeting, which was held during the election of the Board of Trustees every two years. Naturally, the officers, including the President, were to exercise the powers vested by Section 2 of the amended By-Laws for a term of only two years, not five years.Ineluctably, the petitioner, having assumed as President of AUP on January 23, 2001, could serve for only two years, or until January 22, 2003. By the time of his removal for cause as President on January 27, 2003, he was already occupying the office in a hold-over capacity, and could be removed at any time, without cause, upon the election or appointment of his successor. His insistence on holding on to the office was untenable, therefore, and with more reason when one considers that his removal was due to the loss of confidence on the part of the Board of Trustees.4.Petitioner was not denied due processThe petitioner complains that he was denied due process because he was deprived of the right to be heard and to seek reconsideration; and that the proceedings of the Board of Trustees were illegal due to its members not being properly notified of the meeting.Still, the petitioner fails to convince us.The requirements of due process in an administrative context are satisfied when the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their respective sides of the controversy,[27] for the essence of due process is an opportunity to be heard.[28] Here, the petitioner was accorded the full opportunity to be heard, as borne by the fact that he was granted the opportunity to refute the adverse findings contained in the GCAS audit report and that the Board of Trustees first heard his side during the board meetings before his removal. After having voluntarily offered his refutations in the proceedings before the Board of Trustees, he should not now be permitted to denounce the proceedings and to plead the denial of due process after the decision of the Board of Trustees was adverse to him.Nor can his urging that the proceedings were illegal for lack of prior notification be plausible in light of the fact that he willingly participated therein without raising the objection of lack of notification. Thereby, he effectively waived his right to object to the validity of the proceedings based on lack of due notice.[29]5.ConclusionThe removal of the petitioner as President of AUP, being made in accordance with the AUP Amended By-Laws, was valid. With that, our going into the other issues becomes unnecessary. We conclude that the order of the RTC granting his application for the writ of preliminary injunction was tainted with manifestly grave abuse of discretion; that the CA correctly nullified and set aside the order; and that his claim for damages, being bereft of factual and legal warrant, should be dismissed.WHEREFORE, we DENY the petition for review on certiorari for lack of merit, and hereby DISMISS SEC Case No. 028-03 entitled Dr. Petronilo Barayuga v.

DAYSON, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nBERSAMIN, J.:\n\nThe injunctive relief protects only a right in esse . Where the plaintiff does not demonstrate that he has an existing right to be protected by injunction, his suit for injunction must be dismissed for lack of a cause of action.\n\nThe dispute centers on whether the removal of the petitioner as President of respondent Adventist University of the Philippines (AUP) was valid, and whether his term in that office was five years, as he insists, or only two years, as AUP insists.\n\nWe hereby review the decision promulgated on August 5, 2004, [1] by which the Court of Appeals (CA) nullified and set aside the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 21, in Imus, Cavite to prevent AUP from removing the petitioner.\n\nAntecedents\n\nAUP, a non-stock and non-profit domestic educational institution incorporated under Philippine laws on March 3, 1932, was directly under the North Philippine Union Mission (NPUM) of the Southern Asia Pacific Division of the Seventh Day Adventists. During the 3 rd Quinquennial Session of the General Conference of Seventh Day Adventists held from November 27, 2000 to December 1, 2000, the NPUM Executive Committee elected the members of the Board of Trustees of AUP, including the Chairman and the Secretary.\u00a0 Respondent Nestor D. Dayson was elected Chairman while the petitioner was chosen Secretary.\n\nOn January 23, 2001, almost two months following the conclusion of the 3 rd Quinquennial Session, the Board of Trustees appointed the petitioner President of AUP. [2] During his tenure, or from November 11 to November 13, 2002, a group from the NPUM conducted an external performance audit. The audit revealed the petitioner's autocratic management style, like making major decisions without the approval or recommendation of the proper committees, including the Finance Committee; and that he had himself done the canvassing and purchasing of materials and made withdrawals and reimbursements for expenses without valid supporting receipts and without the approval of the\u00a0 Finance Committee. The audit concluded that he had\n\ncommitted serious violations of fundamental rules and procedure in the disbursement and use of funds.\n\nThe NPUM Executive Committee and the Board of Trustees decided to immediately request the services of the General Conference Auditing Service (GCAS) to determine the veracity of the audit findings. Accordingly, GCAS auditors worked in the campus from December 4 to December 20, 2002 to review the petitioner's transactions during the period from April 2002 to October 2002. On December 20, 2002, CGAS auditors reported the results of their review, and submitted their observations and recommendations to the Board of Trustees.\n\nUpon receipt of the CGAS report that confirmed the initial findings of the auditors on January 8, 2003, the NPUM informed the petitioner of the findings and required him to explain.\n\nOn January 15, 2003, Chairman Dayson and the NPUM Treasurer likewise informed the petitioner inside the NPUM office on the findings of the auditors in the presence of the AUP Vice-President for Financial Affairs, and reminded him of the possible consequences should he fail to satisfactorily explain the irregularities cited in the report.\u00a0 He replied that he had already prepared his written explanation.\n\nThe Board of Trustees set a special meeting at 2 p.m. on January 22, 2003.\u00a0 Being the Secretary, the petitioner himself prepared the agenda and included an item on his case.\u00a0 In that meeting, he provided copies of the auditors' report and his answers to the members of the Board of Trustees.\u00a0 After hearing his explanations and oral answers to the questions raised on issues arising from the report, the members of the Board of Trustees requested him to leave to allow them to analyze and evaluate the report and his answers. Despite a long and careful deliberation, however, the members of the Board of Trustees decided to adjourn that night and to set another meeting in the following week considering that the meeting had not been specifically called for the purpose of deciding his case. The adjournment would also allow the Board of Trustees more time to ponder on the commensurate disciplinary measure to be meted on him.\n\nOn January 23, 2003, Chairman Dayson notified the petitioner in writing that the Board of Trustees would hold in abeyance its deliberation on his answer to the auditors' report and would meet again at 10:00 a.m. on January 27, 2003. Chairman Dayson indicated that some sectors in the campus had not been properly represented in the January 22, 2003 special meeting, and requested the petitioner as Secretary to ensure that all sectors are duly represented in the next meeting of the Board of Trustees. [3]\n\nIn the January 27, 2003 special meeting, the petitioner sent a letter to the Board of Trustees. The members, by secret ballot, voted to remove him as President because of his serious violations of fundamental rules and procedures in the disbursement and use of funds as revealed by the special audit; to appoint an interim committee consisting of three members to assume the powers and functions of the President; and to recommend him to the NPUM for consideration as Associate Director for Secondary Education. [4]\n\nOn January 28, 2003, the petitioner was handed inside the NPUM office a letter, together with a copy of the minutes of the special meeting held the previous day. In turn, he handed to Chairman Dayson a letter requesting two weeks within which to seek a reconsideration, stating that he needed time to obtain supporting documents because he was then attending to his dying mother. [5]\n\nIn the evening of January 28, 2003, the Board of Trustees, most of whose members had not yet left Cavite, reconvened to consider and decide the petitioner's request for reconsideration. During the meeting, he made an emotional appeal to allow him to continue as President, promising to immediately vacate his office should he again commit any of the irregularities cited in the auditors' report. He added that should the Board of Trustees not favor his appeal, he would settle for a retirement package for him and his wife and would leave the church.\n\nThe Board of Trustees denied the petitioner's request for reconsideration because his reasons were not meritorious. Board Member Elizabeth Role served the notice of the denial on him the next day, but he refused to receive the notice, simply saying Alam ko na yan . [6]\n\nThe petitioner later obtained a copy of the inter-school memorandum dated January 31, 2003 informing AUP students, staff, and faculty members about his relief as President and the appointment of an interim committee to assume the powers and duties of the President.\n\nOn February 4, 2003, the petitioner brought his suit for injunction and damages in the RTC, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), impleading AUP and its Board of Trustees, represented by Chairman Dayson, and the interim committee. His complaint alleged that the Board of Trustees had relieved him as President without valid grounds despite his five-year term; that the Board of Trustees had thereby acted in bad faith; and that his being denied ample and reasonable time to present his evidence deprived him of his right to due process. [7]\n\nThe suit being intra-corporate and summary in nature, the application for TRO was heard by means of affidavits.\u00a0 In the hearing of February 7, 2003, the parties agreed not to harass each other. The RTC used the mutual agreement as its basis to issue a status quo order on February 11, 2003. [8]\n\nIn their answer with counterclaim, the respondents denied the allegations of the petitioner, and averred that he had been validly removed for cause; and that he had been granted ample opportunity to be heard in his defense. [9]\n\nOrder of the RTC\n\nOn March 21, 2003, after summary hearing, the RTC issued the TRO enjoining the respondents and persons acting for and in their behalf from implementing the resolution removing him as President issued by the Board of Trustees during the January 27, 2003 special meeting, and enjoining the interim committee from performing the functions of President of AUP.\u00a0 The RTC did not require a bond. [10]\n\nAfter further hearing, the RTC issued on April 25, 2003 its controversial order, [11] granting the petitioner's application for a writ of preliminary injunction. It thereby resolved three issues, namely: ( a ) whether the special board meetings were valid; ( b ) whether the conflict-of-interest provision in the By-Laws and Working Policy was violated; and ( c ) whether the petitioner was denied due process. It found for the petitioner upon all the issues. On the first issue, it held that there was neither a written request made by any two\u00a0 members of the Board of Trustees nor proper notices sent\n\nto the members as required by AUP's By-Laws, which omissions, being patent defects, tainted the special board meetings with nullity. Anent the second issue, it ruled that the purchase of coco lumber from his balae ( i.e ., mother-in-law of his son) was not covered by the conflict-of-interest provision, for AUP's Model Statement of Acceptance form mentioned only the members of the immediate family and did not extend to the relationship between him and his balae . On the third issue, it concluded that he was deprived of due process when the Board of Trustees refused to grant his motion for reconsideration and his request for additional time to produce his evidence, and instead immediately implemented its decision by relieving him from his position without according him the treatment befitting a university President.\n\nProceedings in the CA\n\nWith the Interim Rules for Intra-Corporate Controversies prohibiting a motion for reconsideration, the respondents forthwith filed a petition for certiorari in the CA, [12] contending that the petitioner's complaint did not meet the requirement that an injunctive writ should be anchored on a legal right; and that he had been merely appointed, not elected, as President for a term of office of only two years, not five years, based on AUP's amended By-Laws.\n\nIn the meanwhile, on September 17, 2003, the petitioner filed a supplemental petition in the CA, [13] alleging that after the commencement of his action, he filed in the RTC an urgent motion for the issuance of a second TRO to enjoin the holding of an AUP membership meeting and the election of a new Board of Trustees, capitalizing on the admission in the respondents' answer that he had been elected in 2001 to a five-year term of office. He argued that the admission estopped the respondents from insisting to the contrary.\n\nThe respondents filed in the CA a verified urgent motion for a TRO and to set a hearing on the application for preliminary injunction to enjoin the RTC from implementing the assailed order granting a writ of preliminary injunction and from further proceeding in the case. The petitioner opposed the motion for TRO, but did not object to the scheduling of preliminary injunctive hearings.\n\nOn February 24, 2004, the CA issued a TRO to enjoin the RTC from proceeding for a period of 60 days, and declared that the prayer for injunctive relief would be resolved along with the merits of the main case.\n\nThe petitioner sought a clarification of the TRO issued by the CA, considering that his cause of action in his petitions to cite the respondents in indirect contempt dated March 5, 2004 and March 16, 2004 filed in the RTC involved the election of a certain Robin Saban as the new President of AUP in blatant and malicious violation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC. In clarifying the TRO, the CA explained that it did not go beyond the reliefs prayed for in the respondents' motion for TRO and preliminary injunctive hearings.\n\nOn August 5, 2004, the CA rendered its decision nullifying the RTC's writ of preliminary injunction. It rejected the petitioner's argument that Article IV, Section 3 of AUP's Constitution and By-Laws and Working Policy of the Conference provided a five-year term for him, because the provision was inexistent. It ruled that the petitioner's term of office had expired on January 22, 2003, or two years from his appointment, based on AUP's amended By-Laws; that, consequently, he had been a mere de facto officer appointed by the members of the Board of Trustees; and that he held no legal right warranting the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction.\n\nThe CA declared that the rule on judicial admissions admitted of exceptions, as held in National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals, [14] where the Court held that admissions were not evidence that prevailed over documentary proof;\u00a0 that the petitioner's being able to answer the results of the special audit point-by-point belied his allegation of denial of due process; that AUP was the party that stood to be injured by the issuance of the injunctive writ in the form of a \"demoralized administration, studentry, faculty and staff, sullied reputation, and dishonest leadership;\" and that the assailed RTC order sowed confusion and chaos because the RTC thereby chose to subordinate the interest of the entire AUP community to that of the petitioner who had been deemed not to have satisfied the highest ideals required of his office.\n\nIssues\nUndeterred, the petitioner has appealed, contending that:\n\nI.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPPEALS HAS DECIDED CONTRARY TO LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT RULED THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY WRIT OF CERTIORARI APPLIED IN THE CASE AT BAR.\n\nII.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE ESTABLISHED LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE THAT \"ADMISSIONS, VERBAL OR WRITTEN, MADE BY A PARTY IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE SAME CASE, DOES NOT REQUIRE PROOF,\" BY REQUIRING PETITIONER BARAYUGA TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT HIS TERM AS PRESIDENT OF AUP IS FOR FIVE (5) YEARS.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED FACTS WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER BARAYUGA HAS ONLY A TERM OF TWO (2) YEARS INSTEAD OF FIVE (5) YEARS AS CLEARLY ADMITTED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT AUP IN ITS ANSWER.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE BY SOLELY RELYING ON THE CASE OF NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS , WHICH INVOLVE FACTS DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT CASE.\n\nV.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED FACTS WHEN IT UNJUSTIFIABLY ALLOWED THE WAIVER OF NOTICE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.\n\nVI.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED FACTS WHEN IT ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDED THAT PETITIONER BARAYUGA WAS MERELY OCCUPYING THE POSITION OF AUP PRESIDENT IN A HOLD-OVER CAPACITY.\n\nThe petitioner argues that the assailed RTC order, being supported by substantial evidence, accorded with law and jurisprudence; that his tenure as President under the Constitution, By-Laws and the Working Policy of the Conference was for five years, contrary to the CA's findings that he held the position in a hold-over capacity; that instead, the CA should have applied the rule on judicial admission, because the holding in National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals, cited by the CA, did not apply, due to AUP not having presented competent evidence to prove that he had not been elected by the Board of Trustees as President of AUP; and that his removal during the special board meeting that was invalidly held for lack of notice denied him due process.\n\nAUP counters that:\n\nI\n\nPETITIONER IS NOT AN ELECTED TRUSTEE OF THE AUP BOARD, NOR WAS (HE) ELECTED AS PRESIDENT, AND AS SUCH, HE CAN CLAIM NO RIGHT TO THE AUP PRESIDENCY, BEING TWICE DISQUALIFIED BY LAW, WHICH RENDERS MOOT AND ACAMEDIC ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS IN THIS PETITION.\n\nII\n\nEVEN IF WE FALSELY ASSUME EX GRATIA THAT PETITIONER IS AN ELECTED TRUSTEE AND ELECTED PRESIDENT, THE TWO (2) YEAR TERM PROVIDED IN AUP'S BY-LAWS - REQUIRED BY THE CORPORATION CODE AND APPROVED BY THE SEC - IS WHAT GOVERNS THE INTRA-CORPORATE CONTROVERSY, THE AUP'S ADMISSION IN ITS ANSWER THAT HE HAS A FIVE (5) YEAR TERM BASED ON HIS INVOKED SAMPLE CONSTITUTION, BY-LAWS AND POLICY OF THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST NOTWITHSTANDING.\n\nIII\n\nPURSUANT TO THE RULES AND SETTLED JURISPRUDENCE, THE ADMISSION IN THE ANSWER IS NOT EVEN PREJUDICIAL AT ALL.\n\nIV\n\nEVEN IF WE FALSELY ASSUME, JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, THAT THE PETITIONER HAD A FIVE (5) YEAR TERM AS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT, HE WAS NONETHELESS VALIDLY TERMINATED FOR LOSS OF CONFIDENCE, GIVEN THE NUMEROUS ADMITTED ANOMALIES HE COMMITTED.\n\nV\n\nPETITIONER CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT NOTICES OF THE BOARD MEETING WERE NOT SENT TO ALL \"THE TWENTY FIVE (25) TRUSTEES OF THE AUP BOARD\", SINCE: [1] AS THE AUP SECRETARY, IT WAS HE WHO HAD THE DUTY TO SEND THE NOTICES; [2] WORSE, HE ATTENDED AND EXHAUSTIVELY DEFENDED HIS WRITTEN ANSWER IN THE AUP BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING, THUS, WAIVING ANY \"NOTICE OBJECTION\"; [3] WORST OF ALL, HIS AFTERTHOUGHT OBJECTION IS DECEPTIVELY FALSE IN FACT.\n\nThe decisive question is whether the CA correctly ruled that the petitioner had no legal right to the position of President of AUP that could be protected by the injunctive writ issued by the RTC.\n\nRuling\n\nWe deny the petition for review for lack of merit.\n\n1.\nPetition is already moot\n\nThe injunctive writ issued by the RTC was meant to protect the petitioner's right to stay in office as President. Given that the lifetime of the writ of preliminary injunction was co-extensive with the duration of the act sought to be prohibited, [15] this injunctive relief already became moot in the face of the admission by the petitioner himself, through his affidavit, [16] that his term of office premised on his alleged five-year tenure as President had lasted only until December 2005. In short, the injunctive writ granted by the RTC had expired upon the end of the term of office (as posited by him).\n\nThe mootness of the petition warranted its denial. When the resolution of the issue submitted in a case has become moot and academic, and the prayer of the complaint or petition, even if granted, has become impossible of enforcement - for there is nothing more to enjoin - the case should be dismissed. [17] No useful purpose would then be served by passing on the merits of the petition, because any ruling could hardly be of any practical or useful purpose in the premises.\u00a0 It is a settled rule that a court will not determine a moot question or an abstract proposition, nor express an opinion in a case in which no practical relief can be granted. [18] Indeed, moot and academic cases cease to present any justiciable controversies by virtue of supervening events, [19] and the courts of law will not determine moot questions, [20] for the courts should not engage in academic declarations and determine a moot question. [21]\n\n2.\nRTC acted in patently grave abuse of discretion\nin issuing the TRO and writ of injunction\n\nNonetheless, the aspect of the case concerning the petitioner's claim for damages has still to be decided. It is for this reason that we have to resolve whether or not the petitioner had a right to the TRO and the injunctive writ issued by the RTC.\n\nA valid writ of preliminary injunction rests on the weight of evidence submitted by the plaintiff establishing: ( a ) a present and unmistakable right to be protected; ( b ) the acts against which the injunction is directed violate such right; and ( c ) a special and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages. [22] In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive writ constitutes grave abuse of discretion [23] and will result to nullification thereof.\u00a0 Where the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage sans proof of an actual existing right is not a ground for a preliminary injunction. [24]\n\nIt is clear to us, based on the foregoing principles guiding the issuance of the TRO and the writ of injunction, that the issuance of the assailed order constituted patently grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC, and that the CA rightly set aside the order of the RTC.\n\nTo begin with, the petitioner rested his claim for injunction mainly upon his representation that he was entitled to serve for five years as President of AUP under the Constitution, By-Laws and Working Policy of the General Conference of the Seventh Day Adventists (otherwise called the Bluebook ). All that he presented in that regard, however, were mere photocopies of pages 225-226 of the Bluebook , which read:\n\nArticle IV-Board of Directors\n\nSec. 1. This school operated by the _____________ Union Conference/Mission of Seventh-Day Adventists shall be under the direct control of a board of directors, elected by the constituency in its quinquennial sessions. The board of directors shall consist of 15 to 21 members, depending on the size of the institution. Ex officio members shall be the union president as chairperson, the head of the school as secretary, the union secretary, the union treasurer, the union director of education, the presidents of the conferences/missions within the union. xxx.\n\nSec. 2. The term of office of members of the board of directors shall be five years to coincide with the ______________ Union Conference/Mission quinquennial period.\n\nSec. 3. The duties of the board of directors shall be to elect quinquenially the president, xxx.\nYet, the document had no evidentiary value. It had not been officially adopted for submission to and approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u00a0 It was nothing but an unfilled model form. As such, it was, at best, only a private document that could not be admitted as evidence in judicial proceedings until it was first properly authenticated in court.\n\nSection 20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court requires authentication as a condition for the admissibility of a private document, to wit:\n\nSection 20. Proof of private document . - Before any private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved either:\n\n(a) By anyone who saw the document executed or written; or\n\n(b) By evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.\n\nAny other private document need only be identified as that which it is claimed to be. (21 a)\nFor the RTC to base its issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction on the mere photocopies of the document, especially that such document was designed to play a crucial part in the resolution of the decisive issue on the length of the term of office of the petitioner, was gross error.\n\nSecondly, even assuming that the petitioner had properly authenticated the photocopies of the Bluebook , the provisions contained therein did not vest the right to an office in him. An unfilled model form creates or establishes no rights in favor of anyone.\n\nThirdly, the petitioner's assertion of a five-year duration for his term of office lacked legal basis.\n\nSection 108 of the Corporation Code determines the membership and number of trustees in an educational corporation, viz :\n\nSection 108. Board of trustees . - Trustees of educational institutions organized as educational corporations shall not be less than five (5) nor more than fifteen (15): Provided, however, That the number of trustees shall be in multiples of five (5).\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or the by-laws, the board of trustees of incorporated schools, colleges, or other institutions of learning shall, as soon as organized, so classify themselves that the term of office of one-fifth (1/5) of their number shall expire every year. Trustees thereafter elected to fill vacancies, occurring before the expiration of a particular term, shall hold office only for the unexpired period. Trustees elected thereafter to fill vacancies caused by expiration of term shall hold office for five (5) years . A majority of the trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The powers and authority of trustees shall be defined in the by-laws.\n\nFor institutions organized as stock corporations, the number and term of directors shall be governed by the provisions on stock corporations.\nThe second paragraph of the provision, although setting the term of the members of the Board of Trustees at five years, contains a proviso expressly subjecting the duration to what is otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the educational corporation. That contrary provision controls on the term of office. [25]\n\nIn AUP's case, its amended By-Laws provided the term of the members of the Board of Trustees, and the period within which to elect the officers, thusly:\n\nArticle I\nBoard of Trustees\n\nSection 1. At the first meeting of the members of the corporation, and thereafter every two years, a Board of Trustees shall be elected. It shall be composed of fifteen members in good and regular standing in the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, each of whom shall hold his office for a term of two years, or until his successor has been elected and qualified. If a trustee ceases at any time to be a member in good and regular standing in the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, he shall thereby cease to be a trustee.\n\nxxxx\n\nArticle IV\nOfficers\n\nSection 1. Election of officers . - At their organization meeting , the members of the Board of Trustees shall elect from among themselves a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, a President, a Secretary, a Business Manager, and a Treasurer. The same persons may hold and perform the duties of more than one office, provided they are not incompatible with each other. [26]\n\nIn light of foregoing, the members of the Board of Trustees were to serve a term of office of only two years; and the officers, who included the President, were to be elected from among the members of the Board of Trustees during their organizational meeting, which was held during the election of the Board of Trustees every two years . Naturally, the officers, including the President, were to exercise the powers vested by Section 2 of the amended By-Laws for a term of only two years, not five years.\n\nIneluctably, the petitioner, having assumed as President of AUP on January 23, 2001, could serve for only two years, or until January 22, 2003. By the time of his removal for cause as President on January 27, 2003, he was already occupying the office in a hold-over capacity, and could be removed at any time , without cause , upon the election or appointment of his successor. His insistence on holding on to the office was untenable, therefore, and with more reason when one considers that his removal was due to the loss of confidence on the part of the Board of Trustees.\n\n4.\nPetitioner was not denied due process\n\nThe petitioner complains that he was denied due process because he was deprived of the right to be heard and to seek reconsideration; and that the proceedings of the Board of Trustees were illegal due to its members not being properly notified of the meeting.\n\nStill, the petitioner fails to convince us.\n\nThe requirements of due process in an administrative context are satisfied when the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their respective sides of the controversy, [27] for the essence of due process is an opportunity to be heard. [28] Here, the petitioner was accorded the full opportunity to be heard, as borne by the fact that he was granted the opportunity\u00a0 to\u00a0 refute\u00a0 the adverse findings contained in the GCAS audit report and that the Board of Trustees first heard his side during the board meetings before his removal. After having voluntarily offered his refutations in the proceedings before the Board of Trustees, he should not now be permitted to denounce the proceedings and to plead the denial of due process after the decision of the Board of Trustees was adverse to him.\n\nNor can his urging that the proceedings were illegal for lack of prior notification be plausible in light of the fact that he willingly participated therein without raising the objection of lack of notification. Thereby, he effectively waived his right to object to the validity of the proceedings based on lack of due notice. [29]\n\n5.\nConclusion\n\nThe removal of the petitioner as President of AUP, being made in accordance with the AUP Amended By-Laws, was valid. With that, our going into the other issues becomes unnecessary. We conclude that the order of the RTC granting his application for the writ of preliminary injunction was tainted with manifestly grave abuse of discretion; that the CA correctly nullified and set aside the order; and that his claim for damages, being bereft of factual and legal warrant, should be dismissed.\n\nWHEREFORE , we DENY the petition for review on certiorari for lack of merit, and hereby DISMISS SEC Case No. 028-03 entitled Dr. Petronilo Barayuga v.

PRESIDING JUDGE OF RTC, QUEZON CITY, BR. 105 AND MANILA BANKING CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.[G.R. No. 128422] DOLORES V. MOLINA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND EPIMACO ORETA, RESPONDENTS. [G.R. No. 128911] THE MANILA BANKING CORPORATION AND ALBERTO V. REYES, PETITIONERS, VS. DOLORES V. MOLINA AND HON. MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.DECISION LEONEN, J.: These consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994.[1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration.[2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.[4]In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00.[5]On August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco).[6]In order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.I G.R. No. 109645[7]On November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088.[8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\"[9]Several days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case.[10]On April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\"[11] The Motion was granted on the same date.[12]The Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified.[13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties.[14]On July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\"[15]However, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing.[16]At this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition.[17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18](2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19](3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:[T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition.[21]During the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988.[22]On September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name.[23]Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[24]Meanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\"[25]Judge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287.[27]The Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:the Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him[28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late.[29]The Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\"[30]Molina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc.[31]Ortigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order.[32] Ortigas prayed that this court:(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\"[33]IIG.R. No. 112564[34]G.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\"[35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920.[36]TMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\"[37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\"[38]Molina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\"[39]Molina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\"[40]The trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss.[41]Molina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993.[42]Molina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC.[43]Molina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993.[44]IIIRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564In the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:WHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[45]This court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties.[46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13.[47]In addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees.[48]As to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.(2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53](3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54](4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:(a)Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55](b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56](c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57](d) Navarro v. Ortigas[58](e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General[61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[62]The filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.[63]Ortigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\"[64] was not granted.On the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994.[65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645.[66]Also, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\"[67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them.[68]Despite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[69]The second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:TO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.IT IS SO ORDERED.[70]In the Resolution dated July 24, 1995,[71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and(3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]Despite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);(b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and(c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]TMBC filed a Motion for Contempt[74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996,[75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:It is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[76] (Emphasis in the original)With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary.[77]TMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108.[78]In the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:WHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.SO ORDERED.[79] (Emphasis in the original)IVFacts of G.R. No. 128422Respondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint,[80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\"[81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\"[82]Oreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands.[83]The registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas.[84]The one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\"[85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.TMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership.[86]In 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\"[87]Molina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\"[88]Molina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael.[89]However, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\"[90]Several of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina.[91]Oreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos,[92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:Psd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated.[93](2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau,[94] stating that:The procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents.[95](3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:from which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings.[96](4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967.[97]Oreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287[98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167,[99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him.[100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\"[101]Molina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939.[102]In September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\"[103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau.[104]Molina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint.[105]In the Resolution dated July 21, 1994,[106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case.[107]Oreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994.[108]Oreta filed a Petition for Review[109] before the Department of Justice.Oreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court.[110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina.[111]With regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088.[112]Molina filed a Comment,[113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088[114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis.[115]Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996.[116]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents.[117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996.[118]Undaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[119] before the Court of Appeals.In her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:Whether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding?[120]Molina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her.[121]The Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:It appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.SO ORDERED.[122]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition.[123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\"[124]The Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997.[125]The Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed.[126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\"[127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals,[128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case.[129]From the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[130] before this court.V Facts of G.R. No. 128911On January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564.[131]The action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856.[132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title.[133]TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court.[134]Molina opposed the Motion to Dismiss.[135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997.[136]TMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes)[137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:Before this Court are the following:Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997TMBC Motion to DismissBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to DismissTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.Considering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.Accordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.Let summons be served on the newly named defendant.There is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.SO ORDERED.[138]TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.[139]TMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order.[140]TMBC and Reyes argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint.[141]TMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina.[142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping.[143]VI Procedural developmentIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment.[144]Oreta filed a Motion to Consolidate[145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997.[146]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate[147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.[148]Molina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate.[149]In the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate.[150]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases.[151]In the Resolution dated June 23, 1997,[152] this court noted the following:(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;(b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;(c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and(d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997.[154]On August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction].[155]TMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920.[157]TMBC and Reyes also argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice.[158]In the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\"[159]In the Resolution dated September 3, 1997,[160] this court noted the following:(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina.(b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder[161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997)[162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder.[163]In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.][165]In the same Resolution,[166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.[167]TMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997].[168]TMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket[169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\"[170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic.[171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997.[172]From the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance[173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911.[174]VIIIssuesIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and](2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal.[175]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176] over TMBC's properties; and(2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.VIIIArguments of the partiesG.R. No. 128422Molina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition,[178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office.[179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\"[180]Molina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[181]Molina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\"[182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process.[183]On the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment.[184]Molina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088.[185]Oreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\"[186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:[187]Section 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)Molina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside.[188]Since an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\"[189]Oreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed.[190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment.[191]In her Reply,[192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\"[193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088.[194]Molina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[195]Oreta filed a Rejoinder[196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review.[197]G.R. No. 128911TMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.][198]Ownership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina,[199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation,[200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta,[201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol.[202]Despite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title[203] and an Amended Complaint.[204]TMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:That I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof.[205]Molina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void.[206]In her Comment,[207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court.[208]She filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party.[209]The Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes.[210]The trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes.[211]TMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997.[212]Molina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was.[213]Molina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss.[214]This court now rules as follows:G.R. No. 128422The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997[215] and March 11, 1997[216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.Section 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:Section 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.b. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.d. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96[217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.In Donato v. Court of Appeals,[218] this court held that:[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration.[219]The ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David[220] and Valdecantos v. People[221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.In this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:In the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration.[222] (Emphasis supplied)Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.However, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.Prior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her.[223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996.[224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997.[225]In other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.In Crespo v. Judge Mogul:[226][t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.In order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court.[227]The ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al.[228]In subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts.[229]Chan v. Formaran III, et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.[230] It was further discussed that:[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion.[231]Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.In any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).Chief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\"[232] He discussed the following:Contrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.We have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title.[233]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:After an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor.[234]Chief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.This court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata:[235][T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well.[236]G.R. No. 128911In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:In its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"The case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.Now, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.SO ORDERED.[238]TMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997.[239]Molina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation[240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case:[241]3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC.[242]Molina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases.[243]In addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier.[244]Judge Bacalla also filed his explanation.[245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina, he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997.[246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997.[247]Molina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated.[248]This court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.In the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:WHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.In G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[249]That Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.Forum shopping is defined as:[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court.[250]Forum shopping consists of the following elements:(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.[251]All the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.For the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:ascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.[252]In this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership.[253]Molina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.Further, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.The elements of res judicata are:(a) the former judgment must be final;(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and(d) there must be between the first and the second actions (i) identity of parties, (ii) identity of subject matter, and (iii) identity of cause of action.[254]These requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.This court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00.[256]This court held that:[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \"no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.Apart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.Evidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.Evidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[257] (Emphasis in the original)Regarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997.[258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:(1)DECLARE Dolores V. Molina GUILTY of contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;(2) The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is made PERMANENT; and(3) Treble costs[259] are imposed against Dolores V. Molina.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr.,* Del Castillo (Acting Chairperson), Villarama, Jr.,** and Mendoza, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting Member per S.O.

MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nLEONEN, J.:\n\nThese consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.\n\nG.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994. [1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration. [2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration. [4]\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00. [5]\n\nOn August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco). [6]\n\nIn order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.\n\nI\nG.R. No. 109645 [7]\n\nOn November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088. [8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\" [9]\n\nSeveral days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case. [10]\n\nOn April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\" [11] The Motion was granted on the same date. [12]\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified. [13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties. [14]\n\nOn July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:\n(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\" [15]\nHowever, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing. [16]\n\nAt this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition. [17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18]\n | \n(2) | Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19]\n | \n(3) | The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:\n | \n | [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\" [18] (2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina. [19] (3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that: [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc. [20] Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition. [21]\n\nDuring the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:\n[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988. [22]\nOn September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name. [23]\n\nOrtigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [24]\n\nMeanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\" [25]\n\nJudge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287. [27]\n\nThe Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:\nthe Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him [28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late. [29]\nThe Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\" [30]\n\nMolina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc. [31]\n\nOrtigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. [32] Ortigas prayed that this court:\n(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and\n\n(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\" [33]\nII\nG.R. No. 112564 [34]\n\nG.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\" [35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920. [36]\n\nTMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\" [37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\" [38]\n\nMolina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\" [39]\n\nMolina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\" [40]\n\nThe trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss. [41]\n\nMolina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993. [42]\n\nMolina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC. [43]\n\nMolina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993. [44]\n\nIII\nRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564\n\nIn the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [45]\nThis court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties. [46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13. [47]\n\nIn addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:\n[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees. [48]\nAs to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49]of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.\n | | \n(2) | As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50]She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51]Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52]She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53]\n | | \n(3) | The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54]\n | | \n(4) | Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:\n | | \n | (a) | Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55]\n | (b) | Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56]\n | (c) | Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57]\n | (d) | Navarro v. Ortigas[58]\n | (e) | Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59]The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\" [49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs. (2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\" [50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her. [51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088. [52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\" [53] (3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\" [54] (4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely: (a) Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo [55] (b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz [56] (c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas [57] (d) Navarro v. Ortigas [58] (e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085. [59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\" [60] This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General [61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [62]\n\nThe filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt. [63]\n\nOrtigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\" [64] was not granted.\n\nOn the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994. [65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645. [66]\n\nAlso, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\" [67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them. [68]\n\nDespite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [69]\n\nThe second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:\nTO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [70]\nIn the Resolution dated July 24, 1995, [71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(2) | To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and\n | \n(3) | To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and (3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition. [72]\nDespite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);\n | \n(b) | [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and\n | \n(c) | [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995); (b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and (c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\" [73]\nTMBC filed a Motion for Contempt [74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, [75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:\nIt is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [76] (Emphasis in the original) With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary. [77]\n\nTMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108. [78]\n\nIn the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:\nWHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [79] (Emphasis in the original)\nIV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128422\n\nRespondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint, [80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\" [81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\" [82]\n\nOreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands. [83]\n\nThe registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas. [84]\n\nThe one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\" [85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.\n\nTMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership. [86]\n\nIn 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\" [87]\n\nMolina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\" [88]\n\nMolina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael. [89]\n\nHowever, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\" [90]\n\nSeveral of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina. [91]\n\nOreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:\n\n(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos, [92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:\nPsd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated. [93]\n(2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau, [94] stating that:\nThe procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents. [95]\n(3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:\nfrom which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings. [96]\n(4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967. [97]\n\nOreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287 [98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167, [99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him. [100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\" [101]\n\nMolina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939. [102]\n\nIn September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\" [103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau. [104]\n\nMolina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint. [105]\n\nIn the Resolution dated July 21, 1994, [106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case. [107]\n\nOreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994. [108]\n\nOreta filed a Petition for Review [109] before the Department of Justice.\n\nOreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court. [110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina. [111]\n\nWith regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088. [112]\n\nMolina filed a Comment, [113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088 [114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis. [115]\n\nChief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996. [116]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents. [117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996. [118]\n\nUndaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [119] before the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:\nWhether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding? [120]\nMolina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her. [121]\n\nThe Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:\nIt appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.\n\nSO ORDERED. [122]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition. [123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\" [124]\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997. [125]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed. [126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\" [127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals , [128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case. [129]\n\nFrom the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [130] before this court.\n\nV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128911\n\nOn January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564. [131]\n\nThe action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856. [132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title. [133]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court. [134]\n\nMolina opposed the Motion to Dismiss. [135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997. [136]\n\nTMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes) [137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:\nBefore this Court are the following:\nSupplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997\n\nTMBC Motion to Dismiss\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to Dismiss\n\nTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.\nConsidering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.\n\nAccordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.\n\nLet summons be served on the newly named defendant.\n\nThere is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.\n\nSO ORDERED. [138]\nTMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. [139]\n\nTMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order. [140]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint. [141]\nTMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina. [142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping. [143]\n\nVI\nProcedural development\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment. [144]\n\nOreta filed a Motion to Consolidate [145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997. [146]\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate [147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. [148]\n\nMolina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate. [149]\n\nIn the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate. [150]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases. [151]\n\nIn the Resolution dated June 23, 1997, [152] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;\n(b) | Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;\n(c) | Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and\n(d) | Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction; (b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina; (c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and (d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911. [153] TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997. [154]\n\nOn August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction]. [155]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. [157]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice. [158]\nIn the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\" [159]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 3, 1997, [160] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | In G.R. No. 128911:\n | (i) | TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and\n | (ii) | Comment filed by Dolores Molina.\n(b) | In G.R. No. 128422:\n | (i) | Comment filed by Oreta;\n | (ii) | Reply filed by Molina; and\n | (iii) | Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina. (b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply. Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder [161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997) [162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder. [163]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.] [165]\nIn the same Resolution, [166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment. [167]\nTMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997]. [168]\n\nTMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket [169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\" [170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic. [171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:\n6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;\n\n6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997. [172]\nFrom the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance [173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911. [174]\n\nVII\nIssues\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:\n(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and]\n\n(2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal. [175]\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176]over TMBC's properties; and\n | \n(2) | Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177]and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\" [176] over TMBC's properties; and (2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, [177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\nVIII\nArguments of the parties\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nMolina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition, [178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office. [179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\" [180]\n\nMolina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [181]\n\nMolina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\" [182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process. [183]\n\nOn the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment. [184]\n\nMolina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088. [185]\n\nOreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\" [186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure: [187]\nSection 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:\n\n(a)\u00a0 In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;\n\n(b)\u00a0 In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and\n\n(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)\nMolina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside. [188]\n\nSince an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\" [189]\n\nOreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed. [190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment. [191]\n\nIn her Reply, [192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\" [193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088. [194]\n\nMolina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [195]\n\nOreta filed a Rejoinder [196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review. [197]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nTMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:\n2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.] [198]\nOwnership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina , [199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation , [200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta , [201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol . [202]\n\nDespite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title [203] and an Amended Complaint. [204]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:\nThat I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof. [205]\nMolina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void. [206]\n\nIn her Comment, [207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court. [208]\n\nShe filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party. [209]\n\nThe Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes. [210]\n\nThe trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes. [211]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997. [212]\n\nMolina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was. [213]\n\nMolina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. [214]\n\nThis court now rules as follows:\n\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nThe Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997 [215] and March 11, 1997 [216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.\n\nSection 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:\nSection 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.\n\nb. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.\n\nd. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.\n\n(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.\nSupreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96 [217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:\n1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.\n\n3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.\n\n4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.\n\n5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.\nIn Donato v. Court of Appeals , [218] this court held that:\n[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration. [219]\nThe ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David [220] and Valdecantos v. People [221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.\n\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:\nIn the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration. [222] (Emphasis supplied)\nThus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.\n\nHowever, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.\n\nPrior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her. [223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996. [224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997. [225]\n\nIn other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.\n\nIn Crespo v. Judge Mogul : [226]\n[t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.\n\nIn order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court. [227]\nThe ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al . [228]\nIn subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. [229]\nChan v. Formaran III , et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65. [230] It was further discussed that:\n[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion. [231]\nThus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.\n\nIn any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).\n\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\" [232] He discussed the following:\nContrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.\n\nWe have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title. [233]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:\nAfter an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor. [234]\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThis court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata : [235]\n\n[T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well. [236]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:\nIn its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\n\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.\n\n(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"\nThe case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.\n\nNow, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.\n\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;\n\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [238]\nTMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997. [239]\n\nMolina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation [240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case: [241]\n3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC. [242]\nMolina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases. [243]\n\nIn addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier. [244]\n\nJudge Bacalla also filed his explanation. [245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina , he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997. [246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997. [247]\n\nMolina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated. [248]\n\nThis court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [249]\nThat Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.\n\nForum shopping is defined as:\n[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court. [250]\nForum shopping consists of the following elements:\n(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;\n\n(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and\n\n(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration. [251]\nAll the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.\n\nFor the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:\nascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. [252]\nIn this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership. [253]\n\nMolina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nFurther, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.\n\nThe elements of res judicata are:\n(a) the former judgment must be final;\n\n(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;\n\n(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and\n\n(d) there must be between the first and the second actions\n\n(i) identity of parties,\n\n(ii) identity of subject matter, and\n\n(iii) identity of cause of action. [254]\nThese requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nThis court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00. [256]\n\nThis court held that:\n[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \" no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.\n\nApart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.\n\nEvidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.\n\nEvidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [257] (Emphasis in the original)\nRegarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997. [258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | DECLAREDolores V. MolinaGUILTYof contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;\n | \n(2) | The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is madePERMANENT; and\n | \n(3) | Treble costs[259]are imposed against Dolores V.

CALAYOAN, PROCESS SERVER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 2, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nNICETAS TANIEZA-CALAYOAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ELMER JERRY C. CALAYOAN, PROCESS SERVER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 2, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\nBefore the Court is an administrative complaint for Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct filed by Nicetas Tanieza-Calayoan (Nicetas) against her husband, Elmer Jerry C. Calayoan (Elmer Jerry), a Process Server of Branch 2, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Bangued, Abra.\n\nThe Antecedent Facts\nNicetas and Elmer Jerry were married on 18 March 1993 and they subsequently had two children, Michael Jessie T. Calayoan (Michael Jessie) and Jenny Ann T. Calayoan (Jenny Ann). In a sworn Letter-Complaint dated 15 August 2005, [1] Nicetas alleged that Elmer Jerry abandoned her and their children since 18 May 2005 and that he was having an illicit affair with Rina Balboa (Rina). Nicetas further alleged that on 5 August 2005, she and her daughter Jenny Ann saw Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal, where the latter admitted to Nicetas that she was then three months pregnant. [2]\n\nIn his Comment dated 18 January 2006, [3] Elmer Jerry denied that he had any illicit relations with Rina and maintained that Rina was simply a neighbor. Elmer Jerry insisted that the complaint filed by Nicetas was merely a result of her jealousy and suspicion. He further denied the allegation that he was seen with Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005 because on this date, a Friday, he was on duty at Branch 2, RTC, Bangued, Abra. To support his claim, Elmer Jerry submitted a certified photocopy of his Daily Time Record (DTR). [4] Elmer Jerry also denied the allegation that he has abandoned his wife and children. On the contrary, Elmer Jerry claimed that he was still living in their family home in Barangay Deet, Tayum, while his wife and children left him to live in Bangued. [5]\n\nOn 10 October 2005, a criminal complaint for Concubinage [6] was filed against Elmer Jerry and Rina in the Municipal Trial Court of Tayum-Pe\u00f1arrubia, Abra. This, however, was subsequently dismissed on a technicality as the criminal complaint was improperly filed. [7] No other criminal complaint for Concubinage was filed against Elmer Jerry and Rina. [8]\n\nIn a letter dated 7 February 2006, [9] Nicetas wrote to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), reiterating her allegation that (1) she and her daughter saw Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005; (2) when Elmer Jerry and Rina found out that Nicetas had filed an administrative complaint, they transferred to live in the family home of Rina's mother in Bagalay, Tayum, Abra; (3) when Elmer Jerry and Rina became aware of the criminal complaint for Concubinage that was filed against them, they moved back to the house of Rina in Turod, Tayum, Abra, where it was of common knowledge that they were cohabiting as husband and wife; (4) Rina gave birth to a baby girl on 21 January 2006; and (5) Elmer Jerry had had several other illicit relations, one of which was with Rosemarie Jacquias (Rosemarie), a nursing student of Abra Valley Colleges. In support of the allegation that Elmer Jerry had illicit relations with Rosemarie, Nicetas attached the Minutes of Meeting dated 15 June 2000 between the school officials of Abra Valley Colleges, and Rosemarie and her parents. [10] Nicetas also attached Rosemarie's promissory note wherein she promised to stop her \"illicit relationship with Jerry Calayoan.\" [11]\n\nIn his Comment dated 11 September 2006, [12] Elmer Jerry again insisted that his alleged illicit relationships with other women, including that with Rosemarie, were all imaginary and merely the suspicions of his wife Nicetas. As to the picture of Elmer Jerry and Rina, which Nicetas attached to her letter to the OCA, Elmer Jerry explained that it was a simple group picture taken when he was attending a wedding during which Rina was also present as a godmother for a baptism. Finally, as to the daughter of Rina, Elmer Jerry alleged that he had \"no knowledge sufficient to form a belief about this fact\" and that Nicetas was merely speculating that he sired the child.\n\nOn 17 July 2006, in accordance with the recommendation of the OCA dated 22 May 2006, [13] the Court referred the instant administrative matter to the Executive Judge of the RTC at Bucay, Abra for investigation, report and recommendation. [14]\n\nThen Acting Presiding Judge Charito B. Gonzales (Judge Gonzales) initially presided over the investigation of this matter. Thereafter, upon appointment of Judge Elpidio C. Cablayan (Judge Cablayan) to Branch 58, RTC, Bucay, Judge Gonzales turned over this administrative matter to Judge Cablayan. Judge Cablayan, however, retired from the service without completing the investigation. Thus, in a Resolution dated 20 August 2008, the Court referred this case to Acting Presiding Judge Gabino B. Balbin, Jr. (Judge Balbin) for investigation, report and recommendation within sixty (60) days from notice thereof. This period lapsed without any report from Judge Balbin. In an Order dated 27 August 2010, Judge Balbin \"relieved himself of any responsibility in trying and deciding\" the case as Judge Jaime L. Dojillo, Jr. (Judge Dojillo) was appointed as the new presiding judge of Branch 58, RTC, Bucay. Judge Dojillo immediately set the case for presentation of evidence. Thereafter, Judge Dojillo began to hear the testimonies of the parties.\n\nHowever, in a Resolution dated 28 February 2011, the Court directed Judge Balbin to continue with the investigation of the case and to decide the same with dispatch. On 23 March 2011, Judge Balbin filed a Motion to be Relieved as Investigating Judge. Pending resolution of this motion, Judge Balbin heard the testimonies of the parties, continuing from where Judge Dojillo left off. Judge Balbin was able to conclude the investigation and thereafter, he submitted his Findings and Recommendation to the Court. His Motion to be Relieved as Investigating Judge, which had become moot and academic, was subsequently denied.\n\nReport of Investigating Judge\n\nJudge Balbin submitted his Findings and Recommendation dated 10 November 2011, [15] recommending that Elmer Jerry be suspended for one (1) year without pay. While Judge Balbin found the DTR of Elmer Jerry a reasonable defense against the alleged sighting of Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005, he gave much credence to the testimony of Michael Jessie in finding that Elmer Jerry and Rina were indeed maintaining an illicit relationship, and thus guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct:\n\nHowever, the testimony of Michael Jessie Calayoan, the son of the complainant and the respondent, is too revealing to be ignored. He testified that on several occasions, his father, Jerry Calayoan, brought him and his sibling, Jenny Ann, to a house in Bagalay, Tayum, Abra where they ate lunch with Rina Balboa. Jerry Calayoan, Rina Balboa and their daughter, Elagerryn, are the occupants of the bungalow. Jerry Calayoan told them that Rina Balboa is his wife and that, Elagerryn, is their daughter . All of these gave him the impression that they are living together as a family. [16] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nJudge Balbin also took note of the name of the daughter of Rina, Elagerryn, which seemed to be derived from the names of Elmer Jerry and Rina:\n\nFurther, the birth certificate of Rina Balboa's child shows that the father's name was recorded as \"unknown\". There is no need to register name [sic] of the biological father. His name and Rina Balboa's name are all over the child's first name, which is a common practice among Filipino couples. The child's first name is \"ELAGERRYN\". \"ELAGERRYN\" was coined from the respondent's fist name \"ELMER JERRY\", while \"xxxRYN\" was added thereto after \"RINA\", Rina Balboa's first name. That the respondent and Rina Balboa flaunted their illicit relationship by naming their child after them, even after a criminal complaint was filed against them, is the height of insensitivity, for which reason the maximum penalty for the offense should be imposed. [17]\n\nThe Recommendation of the OCA\nThe OCA considered the findings of the Investigating Judge well-taken. In a Memorandum dated 3 March 2014, the OCA also relied heavily on the testimony of Michael Jessie in finding truth in Elmer Jerry and Rina's illicit relationship:\n\nxxx Indeed the testimony of Michael Jessie is compelling enough to hold respondent administratively liable for the offense charged. Michael Jessie personally witnessed respondent and Rina living together as husband and wife when respondent himself brought Michael Jessie on several\u00a0 occasions to the house where he and Rina were cohabiting, along with their child. Michael Jessie may have harbored a grudge towards respondent, but the same may be considered justified. As correctly pointed out by Judge Balbin, such feeling of resentment is a common expression of children like Michael Jessie who have been abandoned by their father to live with another woman. Besides, there is no showing that Michael Jessie was unduly pressured by complainant or anyone to testify against respondent. Hence, his testimony is entitled to full faith and credence. [18]\nThe OCA also took note of Elmer Jerry's alleged past relationship with Rosemarie, which he never denied:\n\nIt bears stressing that this is not the first time that respondent has had an illicit relationship. On cross-examination, complainant testified that before Rina, respondent had an extra-marital relationship with Rosemarie, a nursing student, which respondent never denied. Pieces of evidence were presented during the investigation in support of this allegation like the \"Minutes of Meeting at the Abra Valley College on June 15, 2000\" and \"Promissory Note of Rosemarie,\" which were marked as Exhibits \"H\" and \"I\" for complainant. Both exhibits show that Rosemarie expressly admitted that she had an illicit relationship with respondent. Judge Balbin, however, declared that the promissory note was not admitted in evidence because it was not identified by its author or anybody who has personal knowledge of its execution. Nonetheless, respondent's failure to deny his alleged immoral dalliance with Rosemarie is a tacit admission that such relationship existed and renders inconsequential the exclusion of the promissory note as evidence. [19]\nThe OCA also agreed with the finding of Judge Balbin that the name of Rina's daughter, Elagerryn, reflected the illicit relationship between Elmer Jerry and Rina:\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Judge Balbin, respondent and Rina have flaunted their illicit relationship by naming their child after them by combining the first and last syllables of their respective first names even after a criminal complaint for concubinage was filed against them by complainant. Although the case was dismissed due to a technicality, there is enough reason to warrant respondent's suspension from the service for one (1) year. [20]\nBased on the foregoing, the OCA recommended that: (a) the matter be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter; and (b) Elmer Jerry be adjudged guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct and be suspended from the service without pay and other benefits for one (1) year.\n\nIn a Resolution dated 13 August 2014, the Court resolved to re-docket the matter as a regular administrative matter against Elmer Jerry.\n\nThe Issue\nThe sole issue in this case is whether Elmer Jerry is guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe Court finds the report of the OCA in order.\n\nEvery official and employee in the public service is expected to observe a good degree of morality if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the government in the enforcement of the law. [21] Elmer Jerry was expected to adhere to the standard of decency expected of employees in the public service - this is more so because he is an employee of the court. The image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the women and men who work in the judiciary, from the judge to the lowest of its personnel. [22]\n\nElmer Jerry's act of maintaining an illicit relationship with Rina, and previously with Rosemarie, is hardly the behavior expected of court employees. His actions fall under the definition of disgraceful and immoral conduct, provided in the Revised Rules on the Administrative Offense of Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct, to wit:\n\nSection 1. Definition of Disgraceful and Immoral conduct - Disgraceful and Immoral conduct refers to an act which violates the basic norm of decency, morality and decorum abhorred and condemned by the society. It refers to conduct which is willful, flagrant or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to the opinions of the good and respectable members of the community. [23]\nThis Court, on several occasions, has held that abandonment of one's wife and children, and cohabitation with a woman not his wife, constitutes disgraceful and immoral conduct which should be subject to proper disciplinary action. [24] As established by the evidence on record, Elmer Jerry and Rina were living together as husband and wife, and had a daughter whom they named after themselves. In fact, according to Michael Jessie, Elmer Jerry even introduced Elagerryn and Rina as his daughter and wife, respectively. [25]\n\nElmer Jerry abandoned his wife Nicetas and their two children when he started to live together with Rina and Elagerryn. Not only this, but it seems that he has also been remiss in his duty to provide financially for his children with Nicetas. [26] Elmer Jerry's illicit relations with Rina and his abandonment of his family are defmitely contrary to the acceptable norms of morality, especially since he is expected to maintain a certain degree of decency and morality. His conduct shows moral indifference to the opinion of the good and respectable members of the community. He should be held administratively liable for his disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nThe Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, [27] which govern the conduct of disciplinary and non-disciplinary proceedings in administrative cases, provide that disgraceful and immoral conduct is a grave offense for which the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year shall be imposed for the first offense and dismissal for the second. [28]\n\nWhile this may be Elmer Jerry's first offense, his alleged previous relationship with Rosemarie - which seemed to have ceased in accordance with the promissory note issued by the latter, should nonetheless be taken into consideration in imposing the proper penalty. His conduct is serious enough to warrant the maximum penalty for his offense. The recommended penalty of suspension for one (1) year is in order.\n\nWHEREFORE , we find respondent Elmer Jerry C. Calayoan, Process Server, Regional Trial Court, Branch 2, Bangued, Abra, GUILTY of disgraceful and immoral conduct and SUSPEND him for one (1) year from the service without pay and other benefits with a STERN WARNING that a commission of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nBrion, Del Castillo, Mendoza, and Leonen, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Exhibit \"A,\" rollo , p. 5.\n\n[2] Exhibit \"N,\" id. at 65.\n\n[3] Id. at 47.\n\n[4] Exhibit \"E-l,\" id. at 15.\n\n[5] Id. at 56.\n\n[6] Id. at 18.\n\n[7] Id. at 200.\n\n[8] Id.\n\n[9] Exhibit \"G,\" id. at 20.\n\n[10] Exhibit\"H,\"id. at 21.\n\n[11] Exhibit\"I,\" id. at 22.\n\n[12] Id. at 45-46.\n\n[13] Id. at 33-34.\n\n[14] Id. at 36.\n\n[15] Id. at 276-283.\n\n[16] Id. at 281.\n\n[17] Id. at 282.\n\n[18] Id. at 290.\n\n[19] Id.\n\n[20] Id.\n\n[21] Babante-Capales v.

ANISHA* MAGAYOONG-MACABATO WITH HER SPOUSE DATU KHALIQUZZAMAN MACABATO, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF CATAMANAN MAMA, REPRESENTED BY HASAN MAMA, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseG.R. No. 208586 is a petition for review[1] assailing the Decision[2] promulgated on 25 September 2012 as well as the Resolution[3] promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated 25 March 2009[4] of Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur (RTC) in Civil Case No. 1073-93.In its 25 March 2009 Decision, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of petitioners Heirs of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong (petitioners) and against respondents Heirs of Catamanan Mama (respondents). The RTC quieted petitioners' title over the land described in their complaint and ordered respondents to pay damages to petitioners.In its 25 September 2012 Decision, the CA granted respondents' appeal and set aside the RTC's decision. The CA dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of cause of action.The FactsThe CA recited the facts as follows:The disputed piece of land at Lilod-Madaya, Marawi City is -A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast comer of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of Moslem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; x x x.Sometime in 1963, Datu Muslim Ayo executed a \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" of the disputed property in favor of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong for the price of P800.00. Some three years later, the corresponding Original Certificate of Title [OCT] No. P-189 dated 18 November 1966 was issued in the name of Mamalinding Magayoong.On 4 September 1985, Datu Mamalinding Magayoong died intestate. Before he died, though, he declared that the disputed property must be preserved and reserved for his daughters, petitioners-appellees Maimona and Anisah.On 5 September 1985, Baih Dinganoman Magayoong filed with the Regional Trial Court [RTC], Branch IX of Lanao del Sur a Petition for Perpetuation of Testimony of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong regarding the property.Petitioners-appellees Maimona Magayoong, married to Rasid Pangarungan, and Anisah Magayoong, married to Khaliquzaman Macabato occupied the property, where they both built their homes. Sometime in 1980, Maimona and her husband started a clinic in that lot, the Mamalinding Memorial Specialist Clinic.On 17 September 1993, respondents-appellants, the heirs of Catamanan Mama sent a letter demanding that petitioners vacate the property and to pay accrued rent. Attached to the letter was an Alias Writ of Execution dated 4 September 1979 in Civil Case No. 1953 for Partition of Real Property entitled Maroki Asar Ayo Munder versus Muslim Ayo.On 24 September 1993, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 1073-93 before Branch IX of the Regional Trial Court of Marawi City against the heirs of Catamanan Mama for Quieting of Title over the property.Petitioners aver that they are the actual possessors of the subject property since 1963. In fact, in 1981, they mortgaged it with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank for the sum of P10,000.00 to develop the medical clinic built on the property.In their Answer, respondents stated that the subject property was a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.] in the name of Muslim Ayo. They further stated that Mamalinding Magayoong purchased a residential property from Muslim Ayo which apparently was part of Lot 38 under Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. [T-]254 and registered in the name of Daria [sic] Adiong. Mamalinding Magayoong obtained title to the property under OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].A partition proceeding was instituted by Maroki Asar Ayo Munder before the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur, Branch 1 and docketed as Civil Case No. 1953. Lot 38 was partitioned between Muslim Ayo [Lot 38-A], Maroki Ayo [Lot 38-B], and Babai Asar Ayo [Lot 38-C]. The land in question is a portion of Lot 38-C. If at all, respondents aver, petitioners' possession of their portion of the property was by mere tolerance of their predecessors-in-interest.On 25 November 1993, there being no stipulation of facts and no request for admissions, the trial court issued an order declaring the pre-trial terminated.On 28 February 1994, in view of respondents' admission of the material facts in their answer, petitioners moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court rendered its 14 November 1994 decision granting petitioners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and upholding petitioners' position. Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated 20 March 1995. Unperturbed, respondents filed their notice of appeal from the trial court's decision.On 29 December 1999, the Court of Appeals, Manila rendered its decision, to wit:WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and this case is REMANDED to the lower court for reception of the evidence of the parties.SO ORDERED.Hence, trial ensued in the lower court. After the parties submitted their memoranda, the case was submitted for decision.[5]The RTC's RulingThe RTC issued the assailed decision dated 25 March 2009 and ruled in favor of petitioners. The RTC ruled that the evidence proved that petitioners are the owners of the subject land. The RTC stated:As copiously borne by the records, petitioners have preponderantly, if not overwhelmingly, shown that they are the absolute, lawful and true owner [sic] of the parcel of land described in their petition with an area of Five Hundred Ten (510) square meters and covered by OCT No. P-189 (Exhibits \"C,\" \"C-1\" and \"C-2\") issued by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City in the name of the late Mamalinding F. Magayoong in 1966. Said property was acquired by the late Mamalinding Magayoong by purchase from its former owner, Muslim Ayo, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of a Residential Lot (Exhibits \"A\" and \"A-1\" to \"A-9\") which described with particularity its technical descriptions and boundaries, with its exact location and portion being clearly underscored and delineated in the sketch plan (Exhibit \"A-9\") drawn and/or found at the dorsal side of said deed of sale.[6]The RTC further considered that the following facts and circumstances, taken together, prove that petitioners' predecessor-in-interest had exercised right of ownership over the subject property.\"[I]n 1963, he immediately took possession thereof and occupied it openly, publicly, adversely and uninterruptedly by having it fenced with hollow blocks and had constructed a house thereon which has long been used up to the present to house the Mamalinding Specialists' Clinic established by him for his daughters Dra. Maimona Magayoong-Pangarungan and Dra. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato. He had it declared for taxation purposes as shown by the Tax Declarations marked as Exhibits \"D\", \"D-1\", \"D-2\" and \"D-3\"; and thereafter, he paid the corresponding realty taxes thereon as shown not only by the Official Receipts marked as Exhibits \"E,\" \"E-1,\" \"E-2,\" \"E-3,\" \"E-4,\" \"E-5,\" \"E-6,\" \"E-7,\" \"E-8,\" \"E-9,\" and \"E-10,\" but also by the Tax Clearance marked as Exhibit \"F.\" Moreover, he had it, at one time, mortgaged with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank as a security for a P10,000.00 loan he obtained from said bank sometime in 1981 or 1982. As further indicia of possession and ownership over the property in question, the late Mamalinding Magayoong and Denganuman Magayoong (petitioners' parents and predecessors-in-interest) were even interred on the same parcel of land. Above all, their possession of said property was never disturbed for more than thirty (30) years by anybody, much less the respondents. All these facts and circumstances, taken together, deafeningly and eloquently speak of the stark truth that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest were the true and legitimate owners of the parcel of land in question.[7]The RTC pointed out that the land referred to as covered by TCT No. T-254 in the deed of sale is not the same land referred to as TCT No. T-254 registered in the name of Diaria Adiong.Respondents' protestation, however, cannot be taken hook, line, and sinker so to speak. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-254 (Exhibit \"2\") clearly shows on it [sic] face that it was issued only on October 12, 1967, or almost four (4) years after the aforesaid deed of sale (Exhibits \"A\" and \"3\") was executed on November 19, 1963, and it covers a parcel of land located at the Dansalan Townsite with an area of Three Hundred Eighteen (318) square meters. Clearly and undoubtedly, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 by and between Muslim Ayo and the late Mamalinding Magayoong, TCT No. T-254 was not yet existing as it was not yet issued. Besides, the area of the land as reflected in TCT No. T-254 is only 318 square meters, whereas the area of the land sold under the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 was 510 square meters. Thus, no other logical conclusion can be drawn from the aforesaid discrepancies than the fact that Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong did not have in mind TCT No. T-254 at the time they executed the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963.[8]The RTC considered respondents' attempt to cast doubt on the propriety of the deed of sale as an indirect attack on OCT No. P-189 issued to petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Mamalinding Magayoong, by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City on 18 November 1966.The RTC also dismissed respondents' presentation of an Alias Writ of Execution of a decision for the partition of Lot No. 38 in Civil Case No. 1953. The decision was rendered on 2 June 1971, and the Alias Writ of Execution was dated 4 September 1979. Respondents, however, did not register the writ of execution with the Register of Deeds and did not annotate it on OCT No. P-189. Moreover, respondents never filed an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the date of registration of the deed of sale, or the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the subject property. The deed of sale was executed on 19 November 1963, and registered on 2 June 1964. OCT No. P-189 was issued to Mamalinding Magayoong on 18 November 1966.Finally, the RTC ruled that petitioners proved by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, as follows:1. Quieting petitioners' title over the parcel of land described in their petition dated September 22, 1993 and removing any cloud of doubt that may be cast upon it; and2. Ordering the respondents, particularly Hassan Mama, to pay petitioners the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, and P20,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.SO ORDERED.[9]Respondents filed their appellants' brief dated 25 November 2009 through the Public Attorney's Office.The CA's RulingThe CA granted respondents' appeal and reversed the RTC's 25 March 2009 Decision. The CA rejected the RTC's ruling that petitioners' complaint qualified as one for quieting of title.At the outset, it must be stated that had the lower court thoroughly considered the complaint filed, it would have had no other course of action under the law but to dismiss it. Petitioners went no further than to allege in their complaint before the trial court that they received a letter with an attached Writ of Execution from the respondents demanding that they vacate and surrender the property and to pay accrued rentals. The allegation is vague and unconvincing. The trial court could not be reasonably expected to supply the missing details in their complaint. The complaint failed to allege that an \"instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding\" beclouded the petitioners' title over the property involved.They then proceeded to claim that the writ of execution could not be enforced as they were not made a party to the case and prayed, aside from removing clouds on their title, for damages and litigation costs. Hence, through their allegations, what petitioners imagined as clouds cast on their title to the property were respondents' alleged act of ejecting them from their purported property. Clearly, the acts alleged may be considered grounds for a petition for certiorari but definitely not one for quieting of title.[10]The CA ruled that petitioners do not have the requisite title to avail themselves of the remedy of quieting of title. Petitioners claim ownership of the subject property through the deed of sale between Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong and through OCT No. P-189 registered in Mamalinding Magayoong's name. The CA emphasized that the RTC ignored an irregularity in the transaction involving the subject property. The property described in the deed of sale was allegedly covered by a TCT No. T-254, but Mamalinding Magayoong, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, registered the property as OCT No. P-189. The CA also found a disparity between the boundaries of the land described in the deed of sale and the boundaries of the land described in OCT No. P-189.First, it must be remembered that petitioners staunchly claimed that their ownership to the disputed property can be traced to Mamalinding Magayoong who bought the property for P800.00 from Muslim Ayo as evidenced by the 19 November 1963 deed of sale. That instrument states that the subject land was a portion of Lot 38 and covered by TCT No. [T-]254. They allege private ownership, as evidenced by the deed of sale. It must also be emphasized that petitioners are asserting that subsequent to the sale, their predecessor was issued a title to the same property and this time covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic]. The records do not show, that it was ever an alienable land of the public domain. Clearly, the Original Transfer Certificate of Title [sic] must then be void because based on the deed of sale, Lot 38 is a private land covered by TCT No. [T-]254 which, therefore, can no longer be the subject of a free patent.Second, the description of the disputed property as found in the deed of sale does not coincide with the technical description of the land covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic], to wit:Deed of Sale:A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of M[o]slem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by TCT No. [T-]254; x x x.OCT No. P-185 [sic]:Beginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09E.; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.Containing an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE [503] SQUARE METERS.All points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.Bounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala [Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124]; on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak [Lot 51 Dansalan Cad...., along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Musl[e]m [Lot 38-B, Csd-9914].Bearings true.This lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.[11]The CA further stated that petitioners' payment of real property taxes on the subject land for more than 30 years does not prove ownership. The CA reiterated that petitioners are not holders of any legal or equitable title of the subject property, and they failed to meet this requisite for an action to quiet title. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision reads:FOR THE REASONS STATED, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del [Sur], Branch 09 dated 25 March 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new judgment will be entered in Civil Case No. 1073-93 dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action.[12]Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration[13] dated 22 October 2012. The CA denied the motion in a Resolution[14] dated 10 July 2013.The IssuesPetitioners enumerated the following grounds warranting allowance of their petition:With all due respect, it is humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has overlooked factors of substance and value which, if considered in their best lights, would affect the decision herein sought to be reconsidered.With all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners do not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.With all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners failed to establish the identity of the land sought to be quieted.With all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in not finding that herein petitioners are the absolute owners and possessors of the land in dispute.With all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in reversing and setting aside the decision dated March 25, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 09 in Civil Case No. 1073-93, and in dismissing said complaint.[15]The Court's RulingWe remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey to identify the metes and bounds of the subject property, which is referred to by petitioners as the lot covered by TCT No. T-254 and previously registered as OCT No. P-189, and by respondents as a portion of Lot No. 38-C, or \"a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\"Petitioners have been occupying a particular piece of land since 1963, or for more than half a century. However, the evidence submitted by petitioners does not clearly identify the land being claimed.The CA's finding of fact recites the technical description of the subject land. The deed of sale refers to the subject land as follows:A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai Mering, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and lot of Moslem Ayo (part of Lot No. 38) measuring 30 meters, more or less; or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less; assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; the sketch of the portion sold is further made at the back of this instrument and forming part and parcel of this deed[.][16]On the other hand, OCT No. P-189, covered by Free Patent No. 320224 and dated 18 November 1966, refers to the following land:Lot No. 38-C, Csd-9914Beginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21 E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20 W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09 E; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.Containing an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE (503) SQUARE METERS.All points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.Bounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala (Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124); on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak (Lot 51, Dansalan Cad. x x x), along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Muslem (Lot 38-B, Cad-9914).Bearings true.This lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.Note: Lot 38-C is identical to Lot 5005 Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, and is covered by FPA-VII-5-1211.[17]Conduct of a Relocation SurveyConsidering that the real property subject of the present action was never identified with certainty, we remand the present case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey by a team of surveyors to determine the identity of the land claimed by petitioners and respondents.Survey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and its boundaries and contents ascertained; also a map, plat or statement of the result of such survey, with the courses and distances and the quantity of the land. A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a reliable, if not accurate, verification survey. To settle the present dispute, the parties agreed to the conduct of a relocation survey. The Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines (MLSP) provides for the following rules in conducting relocation surveys:Section 593 \u2014 The relocation of corners or re-establishment of boundary lines shall be made using the bearings, distances and areas approved by the Director of Lands or written in the lease or Torrens title.Section 594 \u2014 The data used in monumenting or relocating corners of approved surveys shall be submitted to the Bureau of Lands for verification and approval. New corner marks set on the ground shall be accurately described in the field notes and indicated on the original plans on file in the Bureau of Lands.[18] (Italicization in the original)The team of surveyors shall be composed of a surveyor designated by the petitioners, a surveyor designated by the respondents, and a surveyor designated by the RTC. The survey shall be conducted in the presence of both parties and/or their authorized representatives. The cost of the survey shall be jointly shouldered by both parties.[19]WHEREFORE, the Decision promulgated on 25 September 2012 and the Resolution promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN are SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 9, for the conduct of a relocation survey to determine the property subject of this case, and thereafter to decide the case accordingly.SO ORDERED.Brion, Mendoza, and Leonen, JJ., concur.Del Castillo, J., on official leave.* Also referred to in some parts of the records as Dr. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato.[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.[2] Rollo, pp. 47-59.

No. 208586 is a petition for review [1] assailing the Decision [2] promulgated on 25 September 2012 as well as the Resolution [3] promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated 25 March 2009 [4] of Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur (RTC) in Civil Case No. 1073-93.\n\nIn its 25 March 2009 Decision, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of petitioners Heirs of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong (petitioners) and against respondents Heirs of Catamanan Mama (respondents). The RTC quieted petitioners' title over the land described in their complaint and ordered respondents to pay damages to petitioners.\n\nIn its 25 September 2012 Decision, the CA granted respondents' appeal and set aside the RTC's decision. The CA dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of cause of action.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe CA recited the facts as follows:\nThe disputed piece of land at Lilod-Madaya, Marawi City is -\n\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast comer of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of Moslem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; x x x.\nSometime in 1963, Datu Muslim Ayo executed a \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" of the disputed property in favor of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong for the price of P800.00. Some three years later, the corresponding Original Certificate of Title [OCT] No. P-189 dated 18 November 1966 was issued in the name of Mamalinding Magayoong.\n\nOn 4 September 1985, Datu Mamalinding Magayoong died intestate. Before he died, though, he declared that the disputed property must be preserved and reserved for his daughters, petitioners-appellees Maimona and Anisah.\n\nOn 5 September 1985, Baih Dinganoman Magayoong filed with the Regional Trial Court [RTC], Branch IX of Lanao del Sur a Petition for Perpetuation of Testimony of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong regarding the property.\n\nPetitioners-appellees Maimona Magayoong, married to Rasid Pangarungan, and Anisah Magayoong, married to Khaliquzaman Macabato occupied the property, where they both built their homes. Sometime in 1980, Maimona and her husband started a clinic in that lot, the Mamalinding Memorial Specialist Clinic.\n\nOn 17 September 1993, respondents-appellants, the heirs of Catamanan Mama sent a letter demanding that petitioners vacate the property and to pay accrued rent. Attached to the letter was an Alias Writ of Execution dated 4 September 1979 in Civil Case No. 1953 for Partition of Real Property entitled Maroki Asar Ayo Munder versus Muslim Ayo .\n\nOn 24 September 1993, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 1073-93 before Branch IX of the Regional Trial Court of Marawi City against the heirs of Catamanan Mama for Quieting of Title over the property.\n\nPetitioners aver that they are the actual possessors of the subject property since 1963. In fact, in 1981, they mortgaged it with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank for the sum of P10,000.00 to develop the medical clinic built on the property.\n\nIn their Answer, respondents stated that the subject property was a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.] in the name of Muslim Ayo. They further stated that Mamalinding Magayoong purchased a residential property from Muslim Ayo which apparently was part of Lot 38 under Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. [T-]254 and registered in the name of Daria [sic] Adiong. Mamalinding Magayoong obtained title to the property under OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\n\nA partition proceeding was instituted by Maroki Asar Ayo Munder before the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur, Branch 1 and docketed as Civil Case No. 1953. Lot 38 was partitioned between Muslim Ayo [Lot 38-A], Maroki Ayo [Lot 38-B], and Babai Asar Ayo [Lot 38-C]. The land in question is a portion of Lot 38-C. If at all, respondents aver, petitioners' possession of their portion of the property was by mere tolerance of their predecessors-in-interest.\n\nOn 25 November 1993, there being no stipulation of facts and no request for admissions, the trial court issued an order declaring the pre-trial terminated.\n\nOn 28 February 1994, in view of respondents' admission of the material facts in their answer, petitioners moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court rendered its 14 November 1994 decision granting petitioners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and upholding petitioners' position. Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated 20 March 1995. Unperturbed, respondents filed their notice of appeal from the trial court's decision.\n\nOn 29 December 1999, the Court of Appeals, Manila rendered its decision, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and this case is REMANDED to the lower court for reception of the evidence of the parties.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nHence, trial ensued in the lower court. After the parties submitted their memoranda, the case was submitted for decision. [5]\nThe RTC's Ruling\n\nThe RTC issued the assailed decision dated 25 March 2009 and ruled in favor of petitioners. The RTC ruled that the evidence proved that petitioners are the owners of the subject land. The RTC stated:\nAs copiously borne by the records, petitioners have preponderantly, if not overwhelmingly, shown that they are the absolute, lawful and true owner [sic] of the parcel of land described in their petition with an area of Five Hundred Ten (510) square meters and covered by OCT No. P-189 (Exhibits \"C,\" \"C-1\" and \"C-2\") issued by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City in the name of the late Mamalinding F. Magayoong in 1966. Said property was acquired by the late Mamalinding Magayoong by purchase from its former owner, Muslim Ayo, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of a Residential Lot (Exhibits \"A\" and \"A-1\" to \"A-9\") which described with particularity its technical descriptions and boundaries, with its exact location and portion being clearly underscored and delineated in the sketch plan (Exhibit \"A-9\") drawn and/or found at the dorsal side of said deed of sale. [6]\nThe RTC further considered that the following facts and circumstances, taken together, prove that petitioners' predecessor-in-interest had exercised right of ownership over the subject property.\n\"[I]n 1963, he immediately took possession thereof and occupied it openly, publicly, adversely and uninterruptedly by having it fenced with hollow blocks and had constructed a house thereon which has long been used up to the present to house the Mamalinding Specialists' Clinic established by him for his daughters Dra. Maimona Magayoong-Pangarungan and Dra. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato. He had it declared for taxation purposes as shown by the Tax Declarations marked as Exhibits \"D\", \"D-1\", \"D-2\" and \"D-3\"; and thereafter, he paid the corresponding realty taxes thereon as shown not only by the Official Receipts marked as Exhibits \"E,\" \"E-1,\" \"E-2,\" \"E-3,\" \"E-4,\" \"E-5,\" \"E-6,\" \"E-7,\" \"E-8,\" \"E-9,\" and \"E-10,\" but also by the Tax Clearance marked as Exhibit \"F.\" Moreover, he had it, at one time, mortgaged with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank as a security for a P10,000.00 loan he obtained from said bank sometime in 1981 or 1982. As further indicia of possession and ownership over the property in question, the late Mamalinding Magayoong and Denganuman Magayoong (petitioners' parents and predecessors-in-interest) were even interred on the same parcel of land. Above all, their possession of said property was never disturbed for more than thirty (30) years by anybody, much less the respondents. All these facts and circumstances, taken together, deafeningly and eloquently speak of the stark truth that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest were the true and legitimate owners of the parcel of land in question. [7]\nThe RTC pointed out that the land referred to as covered by TCT No. T-254 in the deed of sale is not the same land referred to as TCT No. T-254 registered in the name of Diaria Adiong.\nRespondents' protestation, however, cannot be taken hook, line, and sinker so to speak. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-254 (Exhibit \"2\") clearly shows on it [sic] face that it was issued only on October 12, 1967, or almost four (4) years after the aforesaid deed of sale (Exhibits \"A\" and \"3\") was executed on November 19, 1963, and it covers a parcel of land located at the Dansalan Townsite with an area of Three Hundred Eighteen (318) square meters. Clearly and undoubtedly, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 by and between Muslim Ayo and the late Mamalinding Magayoong, TCT No. T-254 was not yet existing as it was not yet issued. Besides, the area of the land as reflected in TCT No. T-254 is only 318 square meters, whereas the area of the land sold under the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 was 510 square meters. Thus, no other logical conclusion can be drawn from the aforesaid discrepancies than the fact that Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong did not have in mind TCT No. T-254 at the time they executed the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963. [8]\nThe RTC considered respondents' attempt to cast doubt on the propriety of the deed of sale as an indirect attack on OCT No. P-189 issued to petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Mamalinding Magayoong, by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City on 18 November 1966.\n\nThe RTC also dismissed respondents' presentation of an Alias Writ of Execution of a decision for the partition of Lot No. 38 in Civil Case No. 1953. The decision was rendered on 2 June 1971, and the Alias Writ of Execution was dated 4 September 1979. Respondents, however, did not register the writ of execution with the Register of Deeds and did not annotate it on OCT No. P-189. Moreover, respondents never filed an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the date of registration of the deed of sale, or the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the subject property. The deed of sale was executed on 19 November 1963, and registered on 2 June 1964. OCT No. P-189 was issued to Mamalinding Magayoong on 18 November 1966.\n\nFinally, the RTC ruled that petitioners proved by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, as follows:\n\n1. Quieting petitioners' title over the parcel of land described in their petition dated September 22, 1993 and removing any cloud of doubt that may be cast upon it; and\n\n2. Ordering the respondents, particularly Hassan Mama, to pay petitioners the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, and P20,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.\n\nSO ORDERED. [9]\nRespondents filed their appellants' brief dated 25 November 2009 through the Public Attorney's Office.\n\nThe CA's Ruling\n\nThe CA granted respondents' appeal and reversed the RTC's 25 March 2009 Decision. The CA rejected the RTC's ruling that petitioners' complaint qualified as one for quieting of title.\nAt the outset, it must be stated that had the lower court thoroughly considered the complaint filed, it would have had no other course of action under the law but to dismiss it. Petitioners went no further than to allege in their complaint before the trial court that they received a letter with an attached Writ of Execution from the respondents demanding that they vacate and surrender the property and to pay accrued rentals. The allegation is vague and unconvincing. The trial court could not be reasonably expected to supply the missing details in their complaint. The complaint failed to allege that an \"instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding\" beclouded the petitioners' title over the property involved.\n\nThey then proceeded to claim that the writ of execution could not be enforced as they were not made a party to the case and prayed, aside from removing clouds on their title, for damages and litigation costs. Hence, through their allegations, what petitioners imagined as clouds cast on their title to the property were respondents' alleged act of ejecting them from their purported property. Clearly, the acts alleged may be considered grounds for a petition for certiorari but definitely not one for quieting of title. [10]\nThe CA ruled that petitioners do not have the requisite title to avail themselves of the remedy of quieting of title. Petitioners claim ownership of the subject property through the deed of sale between Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong and through OCT No. P-189 registered in Mamalinding Magayoong's name. The CA emphasized that the RTC ignored an irregularity in the transaction involving the subject property. The property described in the deed of sale was allegedly covered by a TCT No. T-254, but Mamalinding Magayoong, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, registered the property as OCT No. P-189. The CA also found a disparity between the boundaries of the land described in the deed of sale and the boundaries of the land described in OCT No. P-189.\nFirst, it must be remembered that petitioners staunchly claimed that their ownership to the disputed property can be traced to Mamalinding Magayoong who bought the property for P800.00 from Muslim Ayo as evidenced by the 19 November 1963 deed of sale. That instrument states that the subject land was a portion of Lot 38 and covered by TCT No. [T-]254. They allege private ownership, as evidenced by the deed of sale. It must also be emphasized that petitioners are asserting that subsequent to the sale, their predecessor was issued a title to the same property and this time covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic]. The records do not show, that it was ever an alienable land of the public domain. Clearly, the Original Transfer Certificate of Title [sic] must then be void because based on the deed of sale, Lot 38 is a private land covered by TCT No. [T-]254 which, therefore, can no longer be the subject of a free patent.\n\nSecond, the description of the disputed property as found in the deed of sale does not coincide with the technical description of the land covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic], to wit:\nDeed of Sale:\n\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of M[o]slem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by TCT No. [T-]254; x x x.\n\nOCT No. P-185 [sic]:\n\nBeginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09E.; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.\n\nContaining an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE [503] SQUARE METERS.\n\nAll points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.\n\nBounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala [Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124]; on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak [Lot 51 Dansalan Cad...., along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Musl[e]m [Lot 38-B, Csd-9914].\n\nBearings true.\n\nThis lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966. [11]\nThe CA further stated that petitioners' payment of real property taxes on the subject land for more than 30 years does not prove ownership. The CA reiterated that petitioners are not holders of any legal or equitable title of the subject property, and they failed to meet this requisite for an action to quiet title. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision reads:\nFOR THE REASONS STATED, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del [Sur], Branch 09 dated 25 March 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new judgment will be entered in Civil Case No. 1073-93 dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action. [12]\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration [13] dated 22 October 2012. The CA denied the motion in a Resolution [14] dated 10 July 2013.\n\nThe Issues\n\nPetitioners enumerated the following grounds warranting allowance of their petition:\nWith all due respect, it is humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has overlooked factors of substance and value which, if considered in their best lights, would affect the decision herein sought to be reconsidered.\n\nWith all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners do not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.\n\nWith all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners failed to establish the identity of the land sought to be quieted.\n\nWith all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in not finding that herein petitioners are the absolute owners and possessors of the land in dispute.\n\nWith all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in reversing and setting aside the decision dated March 25, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 09 in Civil Case No. 1073-93, and in dismissing said complaint. [15]\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nWe remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey to identify the metes and bounds of the subject property, which is referred to by petitioners as the lot covered by TCT No. T-254 and previously registered as OCT No. P-189, and by respondents as a portion of Lot No. 38-C, or \"a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\"\n\nPetitioners have been occupying a particular piece of land since 1963, or for more than half a century. However, the evidence submitted by petitioners does not clearly identify the land being claimed.\n\nThe CA's finding of fact recites the technical description of the subject land. The deed of sale refers to the subject land as follows:\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai Mering, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and lot of Moslem Ayo (part of Lot No. 38) measuring 30 meters, more or less; or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less; assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; the sketch of the portion sold is further made at the back of this instrument and forming part and parcel of this deed[.] [16]\nOn the other hand, OCT No. P-189, covered by Free Patent No. 320224 and dated 18 November 1966, refers to the following land:\nLot No. 38-C, Csd-9914\n\nBeginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21 E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20 W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09 E; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.\n\nContaining an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE (503) SQUARE METERS.\n\nAll points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.\n\nBounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala (Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124); on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak (Lot 51, Dansalan Cad. x x x), along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Muslem (Lot 38-B, Cad-9914).\n\nBearings true.\n\nThis lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.\n\nNote: Lot 38-C is identical to Lot 5005 Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, and is covered by FPA-VII-5-1211. [17]\nConduct of a Relocation Survey\n\nConsidering that the real property subject of the present action was never identified with certainty, we remand the present case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey by a team of surveyors to determine the identity of the land claimed by petitioners and respondents.\nSurvey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and its boundaries and contents ascertained; also a map, plat or statement of the result of such survey, with the courses and distances and the quantity of the land. A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a reliable, if not accurate, verification survey. To settle the present dispute, the parties agreed to the conduct of a relocation survey. The Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines (MLSP) provides for the following rules in conducting relocation surveys:\n\nSection 593 \u2014 The relocation of corners or re-establishment of boundary lines shall be made using the bearings, distances and areas approved by the Director of Lands or written in the lease or Torrens title .\n\nSection 594 \u2014 The data used in monumenting or relocating corners of approved surveys shall be submitted to the Bureau of Lands for verification and approval . New corner marks set on the ground shall be accurately described in the field notes and indicated on the original plans on file in the Bureau of Lands. [18] (Italicization in the original)\nThe team of surveyors shall be composed of a surveyor designated by the petitioners, a surveyor designated by the respondents, and a surveyor designated by the RTC. The survey shall be conducted in the presence of both parties and/or their authorized representatives. The cost of the survey shall be jointly shouldered by both parties. [19]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision promulgated on 25 September 2012 and the Resolution promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN are SET ASIDE . The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 9, for the conduct of a relocation survey to determine the property subject of this case, and thereafter to decide the case accordingly.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nBrion, Mendoza , and Leonen, JJ. , concur.\nDel Castillo, J. , on official leave.\n\n* Also referred to in some parts of the records as Dr. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato.\n\n[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 47-59.

No. 9209, April 18, 2017 ]\n\nNENITA DE GUZMAN FERGUSON, COMPLAINANT, ATTY. SALVADOR P. RAMOS, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nNENITA DE GUZMAN FERGUSON, COMPLAINANT, ATTY. SALVADOR P. RAMOS, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nBefore the Court is the Complaint-Affidavit, [1] filed by Nenita De Guzman Ferguson (complainant), seeking the disbarment of Atty. Salvador P. Ramos (Atty. Ramos) for falsification, violation of notarial law and engaging in private practice while employed in the government service.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nComplainant alleged that on November 25, 2007, she purchased a house and lot located in San Rafael, Bulacan, for the sum of P800,000.00; that without her knowledge, the seller obtained a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) mainly to transfer the title of the said property to her name; that the seller was unaware that the said CLOA was void ab initio as the subject land was not an agricultural land and there existed a 10-year prohibition to transfer the subject land; that in 2009; complainant instituted a petition for the cancellation of the CLOA before the DAR Office; that the\u00a0 defendants were represented by Atty. Ramos, who was the Chief Legal Officer of DAR-Provincial Office in Bulacan; that complainant withdrew the petition before the DAR and filed the case before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Malolos City (RTC); that upon receipt of the Answer, complainant found out that it was strikingly similar to the one filed by the defendants in the DAR, which was prepared by Atty. Ramos; that complainant discovered that the Deed of Sale [2] dated April 24, 2009, which became the basis of the transfer of title was fraudulently altered as it only covered the sale of the land, not the house and lot, and the price indicated was only P188,340.00, not the amount of P800,000.00 [3] that she actually paid; that her signature and that of her husband, Douglas Ferguson (Douglas), were forged; that Atty. Ramos notarized the deed of sale without their presence; and that complainant and her husband neither appeared, executed nor acknowledged any document before Atty. Ramos as they never met him in person.\n\nIn his Comment, [4] Atty. Ramos denied that he represented the defendants in the case before the DAR but he admitted that he notarized their Answer. With respect to the charge of falsification of the April 24, 2009 Deed of Sale and the notarization of the aforementioned deed, Atty. Ramos likewise denied any participation and countered that his signature as a notary public was forged. Atty. Ramos, nonetheless, admitted that he notarized the \"genuine\" Deed of Sale, [5] dated May 12, 2009, executed between vendor Alfredo Inosanto, and vendees complainant and her spouse, involving the Same property for the amount of P300,000.00. [6] Atty. Ramos surmised that whoever benefited from such dastardly act could be the culprit in the falsification of the document as the forged deed of sale which indicated a lesser purchase price was the one presented in the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan in order to evade payment of a higher capital gains tax.\n\nIn its Resolution, [7] dated February 29, 2012 the Court referred the complaint to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nThe case was then set by the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the IBP for mandatory conference. Thereafter, parties were required to submit their respective position papers.\n\nIn its Report and Recommendation, [8] dated November 21, 2014, the CBD found Atty. Ramos guilty of violating the law on notarial practice and recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year and, in case he held a commission as a notary public; that it be revoked and that he be disqualified to act as a notary public for a period of two (2) years to be counted after his suspension. The CBD stated that the defense of forgery, without any corroborative evidence, was not credible. As to the charge. that of engaging in a private practice while employed in the government service against Atty. Ramos, the CBD opined that it should be addressed to the Civil Service Commission for the determination of his appropriate administrative liability.\n\nIn its Notice of Resolution No. XXI-2015-458, [9] dated June 6, 2015, the IBP-Board of Governors adopted and approved with modification the report and recommendation of the CBD, as follows:\n\nRESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex \"A\", finding the recommendation to be fully supported by the evidence on record and applicable laws and Respondent's notarization of a document in the absence of the parties' in violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Thus, Respondent Atty. Salvador P. Ramos' notarial commission, if presently commissioned, is immediately REVOKED. Furthermore, he is DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a Notary Public for two (2) years and is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months.\n\nThe Court agrees with the findings of the IBP but differs on the imposed penalty.\n\nSection 1, Public Act No. 2103, otherwise known as the Notarial Law states:\n\nThe acknowledgment shall be before a notary public or an officer duly authorized by law of the country to take acknowledgements of instruments or documents in the place where the act is done. The notary public or the officer taking the acknowledgment shall certify that the person acknowledging the instrument or document is known to him and that he is the same person who executed it, acknowledged that the same is his free act and deed. The certificate shall be made under the official seal, if he is required by law to keep a seal, and if not, his certificate shall so state.\nThe importance of the affiant's personal appearance was further emphasized in Section 2 (b), Rule IV of the Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004 which specifically provides that:\n\nA person shall not perform a notarial act if the person involved as signatory to the instrument or document \u2013\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization; and\n | \n(2) | is not personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization; and (2) is not personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules.\nThe afore-quoted rules clearly mandate that a notary public, before notarizing a document, should require the presence of the very person who executed the same. Thus, he certifies that it was the same person who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the contents and truth of what were stated therein. [10] The presence of the parties to the deed is necessary to enable the notary public to verify the genuineness of the signature of the affiant. [11]\n\nIn the present case, Atty. Ramos denied having notarized the April 24, 2009 deed of sale and claimed that his signature was forged. He even alluded that the person who benefited from it could be the forger as the capital gains tax liability was reduced. He, nonetheless, admitted notarizing the \"genuine\" deed of sale, dated May 12, 2009.\n\nRegardless of who the culprit was and the motive of such forgery, Atty. Ramos cannot be exonerated from liability. A perusal of the record would reveal that Douglas, one of the parties in the deed of sale, was not in the Philippines on May 12, 2009, the day the \"genuine\" deed of sale was notarized. Complainant presented a copy of Douglas' passport indicating that he entered the Philippines only on May 26, 2001 and left on June 12, 2001. This substantially established that indeed Douglas could not have personally appeared before Atty. Ramos when he notarized the deed.\n\nMoreover, an examination of the April 24, 2009 and May 12, 2009 deeds of sale disclosed that both documents bore the same document number, page number and book number of the notarial registry of Atty. Ramos. If, indeed, the April 24, 2009 deed of sale, which was issued earlier was forged, how would the purported culprit know the detail of Atty. Ramos' notarial registry?\n\nIt must be emphasized that notarization is not an empty, meaningless and routinary act. It is imbued with public interest. and only those who are qualified and authorized may act as notaries public. [12] In the case of Gonzales v. Ramos, [13] the Court explained the significance of the act of notarization, thus:\n\nBy affixing his notarial seal on the instrument, the respondent converted the Deed of Absolute Sale, from a private document into a public document. Such act is no empty gesture. The principal function of a notary public is to authenticate documents. When a notary public certifies to the due execution and delivery of a document under his hand and seal, he gives the document the force of evidence. Indeed, one of the purposes of requiring documents to be acknowledged before a notary public, in addition to the solemnity which should surround the execution and delivery of documents, is to authorize such documents to be given without further proof of their execution and delivery. A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. Courts, administrative agencies and the public at large must be able to rely upon the acknowledgement executed before a notary public and appended to a private instrument. Hence, a notary public must discharge his powers and duties, which are impressed with public interest, with accuracy and fidelity.\n\nNot only did Atty. Ramos fail to comply with the Rule on Notarial Practice when he notarized the deed of sale without the presence of the parties but he likewise violated Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which obliges a lawyer to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for the law and legal processes; and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which proscribes a lawyer from engaging in any unlawful, dishonest, immoral and deceitful conduct. [14]\n\nAs a lawyer commissioned as notary public, Atty. Ramos was mandated to exercise the function of his office and must observe with utmost care the basic formalities of his office and requisites in the performance of his duties. [15] When Atty. Ramos affixed his signature and notarial seal on the deed of sale, he led us to believe that the parties personally appeared before him and attested to the truth and veracity of the contents thereof. His conduct was fraught with dangerous possibilities considering the conclusiveness on the due execution of a document that our courts and the public accord on notarized documents. [16] Certainly, Atty. Ramos failed to exercise the functions of the office and to comply with the mandates of the law.\n\nIn the case of Santuyo v. Atty. Hidalgo, [17] the respondent lawyer similarly denied having notarized the subject deed of sale. The Court found him negligent not only in the supposed notarization but in allowing the office secretaries to make the necessary entries in his notarial registry which was supposed to be done and kept by him alone. He was suspended from his commissioned as notary public and was disqualified from being commissioned as notary public for a period of two years.\n\nIn the case of Ocampo-Ingcoco v. Atty. Yrreverre, Jr., [18] the respondent lawyer was suspended from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months for notarizing a document without the appearance of the parties. The Court held that a notary public should not notarize a document unless the persons who signed it are the very same persons who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the truth of the contents therein.\n\nIn line with these cases, the Court finds the suspension of Atty. Ramos for six (6) months in order.\n\nWith respect to the allegation that Atty. Ramos was engaged in a private practice while employed in the government service, the Court agrees with the CBD that the issue should be brought before the Civil Service Commission for the determination of his appropriate administrative liability, if any.\n\nFinally, this Court cannot ignore the averments of Atty. Ramos that there were two (2) deeds of sale covering Transfer Certificate of Title No. CLOA-T-15831. One was the April 24, 2009 Deed of Sale which was presented to the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan, and the other one was the May 12, 2009 Deed of Sale which was kept on file at the Notarial Section of the RTC. Both deeds were registered in the Notarial Registry of Atty. Ramos with document number 354, page number 71 and Book VII series of 2009. Because of this irregularity, the Court deems it proper to refer this matter to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for the assessment of the correct tax and for investigation for possible prosecution of the criminal liability of the culprits under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nWHEREFORE, finding Atty. Salvador P. Ramos GUILTY of violating the Rule on Notarial Practice and Rule 1.01 and Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Court hereby SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for six (6) months; REVOKES his notarial commission, effective immediately; and PERMANENTLY BARS him from being commissioned as notary public, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar conduct will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet copies of this decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be attached to the personal record of Atty. Salvador P. Ramos; the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all lower courts; and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, for proper guidance and information.\n\nThe Civil Service Commission and the Bureau of Internal Revenue should likewise be given copies of this decision for their appropriate actions.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nSereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Del Castillo, Mendoza, Reyes, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Martires, and Tijam, JJ., concur.\n\nBersamin, J., no part.\n\nNOTICE OF JUDGMENT\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on April 18, 2017 a Decision /Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled administrative matters, the original of which was received by this Office on may 25, 2017 at 9:30 a.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

      "title": "PHILIPPINE GEOTHERMAL, INC. EMPLOYEES UNION (PGIEU), PETITIONER, CHEVRON GEOTHERMAL PHILS. HOLDINGS, INC., RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N REYES, JR., J: This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated November 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 115796, dismissing the Petition for Review entitled \"Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union (PGIEU) vs. Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc.'' as well as the Resolution[3] dated May 17, 2013 denying Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union's (petitioner) Motion[4] for Reconsideration dated November 27, 2012. The Facts Petitioner is a legitimate labor organization and the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc. (respondent).[5] On July 31, 2008, the petitioner and respondent formally executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was made effective for the period from November 1, 2007 until October 31, 2012. Under Article VII, Section 1 thereof, there is a stipulation governing salary increases of the respondent's rank-and-file employees, as follows: Section 1. WAGE INCREASE The COMPANY will grant the following: - Effective Nov. 1, 2007, P260,000.00 - lump sum payment for the 1st year of this agreement (taxable). - Effective Nov. 1, 2008, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00. - Effective Nov. 1, 2009, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00.[6] In implementing the foregoing provision, the parties agreed on the following guidelines appended as Annex D of said CBA, viz.: Employment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / / Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X / On October 6, 2009, a letter dated September 20, 2009 was sent by the petitioner's President to respondent expressing, on behalf of its members, the concern that the aforesaid CBA provision and implementing rules were not being implemented properly pursuant to the guidelines and that, if not addressed, might result to a salary distortion among union members.[7] On even date, respondent responded by letter denying any occurrence of salary distortion among union members and reiterating its remuneration philosophy of having \"similar values for similar jobs\", which means that employees in similarly-valued jobs would have similar salary rates. It explained that to attain such objective, it made annual reviews and necessary adjustments of the employees' salaries and hiring rates based on the computed values for each job.[8] Finding the explanation not satisfactory, petitioner, with respondent's approval, referred the subject dispute to the Voluntary Arbitration of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). It averred that respondent breached their CBA provision on worker's wage increase because it granted salary increase even to probationary employees in contravention of the express mandate of that particular CBA article and implementing guidelines that salary increases were to be given only to regular employees.[9] To cite an example, petitioner alleged that respondent granted salary increases of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) each to then probationary employees Sherwin Lanao (Lanao) and Jonel Cordovales (Cordovales) at a time when they have not yet attained regular status. They (Lanao and Cordovales) were regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, yet they were given salary increase for November 1, 2008. As a consequence of their accelerated increases, wages of said probationary workers equated the wage rates of the regular employees, thereby obliterating the wage rates distinction based on merit, skills and length of service. Therefore, the petitioner insisted that its members' salaries must necessarily be increased so as to maintain the higher strata of their salaries from those of the probationary employees who were given the said premature salary increases.[10] On the other hand, respondent maintained that it did not commit any violation of that CBA provision and its implementing guidelines; in fact, it complied therewith. It reasoned that the questioned increases given to Lanao and Cordovales' salaries were granted, not during their probationary employment, but after they were already regularized. It further asseverated that there was actually no salary distortion in this case since the disparity or difference of salaries between Lanao and Cordovales with that of the other company employees were merely a result of their being hired on different dates, regularization at different occasions, and differences in their hiring rates at the time of their employment.[11] After due proceedings, the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a Decision[12] dated August 16, 2010 in favor of respondent, ruling that petitioner failed to duly substantiate its allegations that the former prematurely gave salary increases to its probationary employees and that there was a resultant distortion in the salary scale of its regular employees.[13] Thereafter, a Petition[14] for Review under Rule 65 was filed with the CA on September 22, 2010. On November 5, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision.[15] It dismissed the petition for review and sustained the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision. The pertinent and dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads as follows: In fine, We hold that the Voluntary Arbitrator of NCMB did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner union's complaint against respondent company. Settled is the rule that factual findings of labor officials who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality, and they are binding when supported by substantial evidence. In this case, these findings are supported by competent and convincing evidence. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED. The Decision dated 16 August 2010 of the Voluntary Arbitrator of the NCMB Regional Branch No. IV is SUSTAINED. SO ORDERED.[16] On November 28, 2012, petitioner filed its Motion[17] for Reconsideration. This was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution[18] dated May 17, 2013. Hence, this petition. The Issues I. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE CBA IN GRANTING WAGE INCREASE OF P1,500.00 TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD NOT YET ATTAINED REGULAR STATUS II. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GRANT OF WAGE INCREASE TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES IS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVES BY RESPONDENT III. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA ERRED IN NOT ORDERING RESPONDENT TO LIKEWISE INCREASE THE RATES OF OTHER REGULAR EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RATES AND THOSE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY GRANTED PREMATURE WAGE INCREASES Ruling of the Court The petition is devoid of merit. Petitioner and respondent entered into an agreement whereby employees will be granted a wage increase depending on the date of their regularization, viz.: Employment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / / Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X / Petitioner claims that Lanao and Cordovales having been regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, are not covered by the P260,000.00 lump sum and the initial P1500.00 wage increase effective on Nov. 1, 2008. It appears, however, that based on the actual pay slips of union members, Lanao and Cordovales both received wage increase in the amount of P1500.00 effective Nov. 1, 2008 and that such increase was immediately granted to them at the time of their hiring which resulted to the increase of their salaries to P36,500.00 per month. It is further stressed by petitioner that the increase granted by respondent to Lanao and Cordovales are violative of the terms of the CBA, specifically Section 1, Article VII and Annex D, for the reason that these employees have not yet attained \"Regular\" status at the time they were granted a wage increase and thus resulting to a salary/wage distortion. Respondent, for its part, claims that the alleged \"increase\" in the wages of these employees was not due to application of the provisions of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather it was brought about by the increase in the hiring rates at the time these employees were hired. As a matter of fact, a careful scrutiny of the records reveals that respondent have complied with the terms agreed upon in the CBA. Notably, respondent's reply to the petitioner's letter accusing them of violation of the terms of the CBA and holding them responsible for the alleged wage distortion, clarified the ambiguity with regard to the hiring rates, viz.: As for the perceived salary distortion among Union members resulting from the non-implementation of the guidelines on Article VH-Salaries and Allowances, Section 1 - Wage Increase, Annex D of the CBA 2007-2012, we would like to reiterate our discussion during the recent NLMC meeting of September 16, on Chevron's remuneration philosophy of having \"similar value for similar jobs\" which simply states that employees in similarly valued jobs will have similar salary rates. Salaries and hiring rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on the computed values of each job, an employee's tenure or seniority in his/her current position will not influence the value of the job.[19] (Underlining Ours) Clearly then, the increase in the salaries of Lanao and Cordovales was not pursuant to the wage increase agreed upon in CBA 2007-2012 rather it was the result of the increase in hiring rates at the time they were hired. To illustrate, in its Reply,[20] respondent discussed the difference in the hiring rates of employees Lanao and Robert Gawat, viz.: Mr. Robert Gawat was regularized on April 16, 2007 having been hired on October 16, 2007 while Mr. Lanao as shown in the Company's position paper was regularized on January 1, 2010, having been hired only on July 1, 2009. At the time of Mr. Gawat's hiring, the hiring rate for Pay Grade 12 was P31,800.00. On April 16, 2007, Mr. Gawat was given a CBA salary increase under the 2002-2007 CBA of P1,700.00 per month which increased his pay to P33,500.00 per month. He received another CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA on November 1, 2008, thus increasing his pay to P35,000.00. On November 1, 2009, he received another salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA which further increased his pay to P36,500.00 per month until the present. On the other hand, when Mr. Lanao was hired on July 9, 2009, the hiring rate at the time for employees falling under Pay Grade 12 was already P35,000.00, having been adjusted by the company in accordance with market and industry practice. On January 1, 2010, Mr. Lanao was regularized and as dictated by the CBA, he was given a CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 per month effective January 1, 2010 which increased his monthly pay at the present to P36,500.00.[21] (Emphasis and underlining Ours) As shown above, the respondent never violated the CBA and in fact, complied with it to the letter. Clearly, the petitioner only used the respondent's alleged violation of the CBA when its true gripe is related to the respondent's prerogative of setting the hiring rate of the employees over which the petitioner neither has the personality nor the privilege to meddle or interfere with.[22] The second and third issue, being interrelated, shall be discussed jointly. Upon the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act, amending among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term \"Wage Distortion\" was explicitly defined as \"a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rate between and among employee groups an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service or other logical bases of differentiation.\"[23] Contrary to petitioner's claim of alleged \"wage distortion\", Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines only cover wage adjustments and increases due to a prescribed law or wage order, viz.: Article 124. Standards/Criteria for Minimum Wage Fixing. x x x x Where the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law or Wage Order issued by any Regional Board results in distortions of the wage structure within an establishment, the employer and union shall negotiate to correct the distortions. Any dispute arising from the wage distortions shall be resolved through the grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreement and, if it remains unresolved, through voluntary arbitration.[24] (Emphasis Ours) Prubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company[25] laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1) an existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) a significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) the elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) the existence of the distortion in the same region of the country. The apparent increase in Lanao and Cordovales' salaries as compared to the other company workers who also have the same salary/pay grade with them should not be interpreted to mean that they were given a premature increase for November 1, 2008, thus resulting to a wage distortion. The alleged increase in their salaries was not a result of the erroneous application of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather, it was because when they were hired by respondent in 2009, when the hiring rates were relatively higher as compared to those of the previous years. Verily, the setting and implementation of such various engagement rates were purely an exercise of the respondent's business prerogative in order to attract or lure the best possible applicants in the market and which We will not interfere with, absent any showing that it was exercised in bad faith. Management prerogative gives an employer freedom to regulate according to their discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment including work assignment, working methods, the processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers.[26] This right is tempered only by these limitations: that it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employees.[27] Petitioner claims that the wages of other employees should also be increased in order to maintain the difference between their salaries and those of employees granted a \"premature\" wage increase. Such a situation may be remedied if it falls under the concept of a wage distortion as defined by Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines. However, as already discussed, there is no wage distortion in the case at bench. Not all increases in salary which obliterate the salary differences of certain employees should be perceived as wage distortion. In the case of Bankard Employees Union-Workers Alliance Trade Unions v. National Labor Relations Commission,[28] the Court discussed the possible implication of an expanded interpretation of the concept of Wage Distortion, to wit: If the compulsory mandate under Article 124 to correct \"wage distortion\" is applied to voluntary and unilateral increases by the employer in fixing hiring rates which is inherently a business judgment prerogative, then the hands of the employer would be completely tied even in cases where an increase in wages of a particular group is justified due to a re-evaluation of the high productivity of a particular group, or as in the present case, the need to increase the competitiveness of Bankard's hiring rate. An employer would be discouraged from adjusting the salary rates of a particular group of employees for fear that it would result to a demand by all employees for a similar increase, especially if the financial conditions the business cannot address an across-the-board increase.[29] The Court's ruling in the case of Bankard seek to address and resolve conflicting opinions regarding the true concept of a wage distortion like the one presented in this case whereby a legitimate exercise by an employer of its management prerogative is being taken against it in the guise of an allegation that it is circumventing labor laws. An employer should not be held hostage by the whims and caprices of its employees especially when it has faithfully complied with and executed the terms of the CBA. It is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or agreements and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite.[30] On a final note, the Court has ruled time and again that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality by the courts when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the CA, in the exercise of its expanded jurisdiction to review findings of the National Labor Relations Commission.

HOLDINGS, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nREYES, JR., J:\n\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari [1] pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision [2] dated November 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 115796, dismissing the Petition for Review entitled \" Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union (PGIEU) vs. Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc .'' as well as the Resolution [3] dated May 17, 2013 denying Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union's (petitioner) Motion [4] for Reconsideration dated November 27, 2012.\n\nThe Facts\n\nPetitioner is a legitimate labor organization and the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc. (respondent). [5]\n\nOn July 31, 2008, the petitioner and respondent formally executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was made effective for the period from November 1, 2007 until October 31, 2012. Under Article VII, Section 1 thereof, there is a stipulation governing salary increases of the respondent's rank-and-file employees, as follows:\n\nSection 1. WAGE INCREASE\n\nThe COMPANY will grant the following:\n\n- Effective Nov. 1, 2007, P260,000.00 - lump sum payment for the 1 st year of this agreement (taxable).\n- Effective Nov. 1, 2008, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00.\n- Effective Nov. 1, 2009, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00. [6]\n\nIn implementing the foregoing provision, the parties agreed on the following guidelines appended as Annex D of said CBA, viz .:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nEmployment Status | P260K | P1500 | P1500\n | Lump Sum | (Nov. 1, 2008) | (Nov. 1, 2009)\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2008 | / | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 | X | / | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 | X | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 | X | X | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 | X | X | /\n[END_TABLE]\n\nEmployment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / /\n/ Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X /\n\nOn October 6, 2009, a letter dated September 20, 2009 was sent by the petitioner's President to respondent expressing, on behalf of its members, the concern that the aforesaid CBA provision and implementing rules were not being implemented properly pursuant to the guidelines and that, if not addressed, might result to a salary distortion among union members. [7]\n\nOn even date, respondent responded by letter denying any occurrence of salary distortion among union members and reiterating its remuneration philosophy of having \"similar values for similar jobs\", which means that employees in similarly-valued jobs would have similar salary rates. It explained that to attain such objective, it made annual reviews and necessary adjustments of the employees' salaries and hiring rates based on the computed values for each job. [8]\n\nFinding the explanation not satisfactory, petitioner, with respondent's approval, referred the subject dispute to the Voluntary Arbitration of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). It averred that respondent breached their CBA provision on worker's wage increase because it granted salary increase even to probationary employees in contravention of the express mandate of that particular CBA article and implementing guidelines that salary increases were to be given only to regular employees. [9]\n\nTo cite an example, petitioner alleged that respondent granted salary increases of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) each to then probationary employees Sherwin Lanao (Lanao) and Jonel Cordovales (Cordovales) at a time when they have not yet attained regular status. They (Lanao and Cordovales) were regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, yet they were given salary increase for November 1, 2008. As a consequence of their accelerated increases, wages of said probationary workers equated the wage rates of the regular employees, thereby obliterating the wage rates distinction based on merit, skills and length of service. Therefore, the petitioner insisted that its members' salaries must necessarily be increased so as to maintain the higher strata of their salaries from those of the probationary employees who were given the said premature salary increases. [10]\n\nOn the other hand, respondent maintained that it did not commit any violation of that CBA provision and its implementing guidelines; in fact, it complied therewith. It reasoned that the questioned increases given to Lanao and Cordovales' salaries were granted, not during their probationary employment, but after they were already regularized. It further asseverated that there was actually no salary distortion in this case since the disparity or difference of salaries between Lanao and Cordovales with that of the other company employees were merely a result of their being hired on different dates, regularization at different occasions, and differences in their hiring rates at the time of their employment. [11]\n\nAfter due proceedings, the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a Decision [12] dated August 16, 2010 in favor of respondent, ruling that petitioner failed to duly substantiate its allegations that the former prematurely gave salary increases to its probationary employees and that there was a resultant distortion in the salary scale of its regular employees. [13]\n\nThereafter, a Petition [14] for Review under Rule 65 was filed with the CA on September 22, 2010.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision. [15] It dismissed the petition for review and sustained the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision. The pertinent and dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads as follows:\n\nIn fine, We hold that the Voluntary Arbitrator of NCMB did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner union's complaint against respondent company. Settled is the rule that factual findings of labor officials who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality, and they are binding when supported by substantial evidence. In this case, these findings are supported by competent and convincing evidence.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED . The Decision dated 16 August 2010 of the Voluntary Arbitrator of the NCMB Regional Branch No. IV is SUSTAINED .\n\nSO ORDERED. [16]\n\nOn November 28, 2012, petitioner filed its Motion [17] for Reconsideration. This was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution [18] dated May 17, 2013.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nThe Issues\n\nI.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE CBA IN GRANTING WAGE INCREASE OF P1,500.00 TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD NOT YET ATTAINED REGULAR STATUS\n\nII.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GRANT OF WAGE INCREASE TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES IS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVES BY RESPONDENT\n\nIII.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA ERRED IN NOT ORDERING RESPONDENT TO LIKEWISE INCREASE THE RATES OF OTHER REGULAR EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RATES AND THOSE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY GRANTED PREMATURE WAGE INCREASES\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe petition is devoid of merit.\n\nPetitioner and respondent entered into an agreement whereby employees will be granted a wage increase depending on the date of their regularization, viz .:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nEmployment Status | P260K | P1500 | P1500\n | Lump Sum | (Nov. 1, 2008) | (Nov. 1, 2009)\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2008 | / | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 | X | / | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 | X | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 | X | X | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 | X | X | /\n[END_TABLE]\n\nEmployment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X /\n/\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 X /\n/\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X /\n\nPetitioner claims that Lanao and Cordovales having been regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, are not covered by the P260,000.00 lump sum and the initial P1500.00 wage increase effective on Nov. 1, 2008. It appears, however, that based on the actual pay slips of union members, Lanao and Cordovales both received wage increase in the amount of P1500.00 effective Nov. 1, 2008 and that such increase was immediately granted to them at the time of their hiring which resulted to the increase of their salaries to P36,500.00 per month.\n\nIt is further stressed by petitioner that the increase granted by respondent to Lanao and Cordovales are violative of the terms of the CBA, specifically Section 1, Article VII and Annex D, for the reason that these employees have not yet attained \"Regular\" status at the time they were granted a wage increase and thus resulting to a salary/wage distortion.\n\nRespondent, for its part, claims that the alleged \"increase\" in the wages of these employees was not due to application of the provisions of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather it was brought about by the increase in the hiring rates at the time these employees were hired. As a matter of fact, a careful scrutiny of the records reveals that respondent have complied with the terms agreed upon in the CBA.\n\nNotably, respondent's reply to the petitioner's letter accusing them of violation of the terms of the CBA and holding them responsible for the alleged wage distortion, clarified the ambiguity with regard to the hiring rates, viz .:\n\nAs for the perceived salary distortion among Union members resulting from the non-implementation of the guidelines on Article VH-Salaries and Allowances, Section 1 - Wage Increase, Annex D of the CBA 2007-2012, we would like to reiterate our discussion during the recent NLMC meeting of September 16, on Chevron's remuneration philosophy of having \"similar value for similar jobs\" which simply states that employees in similarly valued jobs will have similar salary rates. Salaries and hiring rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on the computed values of each job, an employee's tenure or seniority in his/her current position will not influence the value of the job. [19] (Underlining Ours)\n\nClearly then, the increase in the salaries of Lanao and Cordovales was not pursuant to the wage increase agreed upon in CBA 2007-2012 rather it was the result of the increase in hiring rates at the time they were hired.\n\nTo illustrate, in its Reply , [20] respondent discussed the difference in the hiring rates of employees Lanao and Robert Gawat, viz .:\n\nMr. Robert Gawat was regularized on April 16, 2007 having been hired on October 16, 2007 while Mr. Lanao as shown in the Company's position paper was regularized on January 1, 2010, having been hired only on July 1, 2009. At the time of Mr. Gawat's hiring, the hiring rate for Pay Grade 12 was P31,800.00 . On April 16, 2007, Mr. Gawat was given a CBA salary increase under the 2002-2007 CBA of P1,700.00 per month which increased his pay to P33,500.00 per month. He received another CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA on November 1, 2008, thus increasing his pay to P35,000.00. On November 1, 2009, he received another salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA which further increased his pay to P36,500.00 per month until the present.\n\nOn the other hand, when Mr. Lanao was hired on July 9, 2009, the hiring rate at the time for employees falling under Pay Grade 12 was already P35,000.00 , having been adjusted by the company in accordance with market and industry practice. On January 1, 2010, Mr. Lanao was regularized and as dictated by the CBA, he was given a CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 per month effective January 1, 2010 which increased his monthly pay at the present to P36,500.00. [21] (Emphasis and underlining Ours)\n\nAs shown above, the respondent never violated the CBA and in fact, complied with it to the letter. Clearly, the petitioner only used the respondent's alleged violation of the CBA when its true gripe is related to the respondent's prerogative of setting the hiring rate of the employees over which the petitioner neither has the personality nor the privilege to meddle or interfere with. [22]\n\nThe second and third issue, being interrelated, shall be discussed jointly.\n\nUpon the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act, amending among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term \" Wage Distortion\" was explicitly defined as \"a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rate between and among employee groups an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service or other logical bases of differentiation. \" [23]\n\nContrary to petitioner's claim of alleged \"wage distortion\", Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines only cover wage adjustments and increases due to a prescribed law or wage order , viz .:\n\nArticle 124. Standards/Criteria for Minimum Wage Fixing .\n\nx x x x\n\nWhere the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law or Wage Order issued by any Regional Board results in distortions of the wage structure within an establishment, the employer and union shall negotiate to correct the distortions. Any dispute arising from the wage distortions shall be resolved through the grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreement and, if it remains unresolved, through voluntary arbitration. [24] (Emphasis Ours)\n\nPrubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company [25] laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1) an existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) a significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) the elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) the existence of the distortion in the same region of the country.\n\nThe apparent increase in Lanao and Cordovales' salaries as compared to the other company workers who also have the same salary/pay grade with them should not be interpreted to mean that they were given a premature increase for November 1, 2008, thus resulting to a wage distortion. The alleged increase in their salaries was not a result of the erroneous application of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather, it was because when they were hired by respondent in 2009, when the hiring rates were relatively higher as compared to those of the previous years. Verily, the setting and implementation of such various engagement rates were purely an exercise of the respondent's business prerogative in order to attract or lure the best possible applicants in the market and which We will not interfere with, absent any showing that it was exercised in bad faith.\n\nManagement prerogative gives an employer freedom to regulate according to their discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment including work assignment, working methods, the processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers. [26] This right is tempered only by these limitations: that it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employees. [27]\n\nPetitioner claims that the wages of other employees should also be increased in order to maintain the difference between their salaries and those of employees granted a \"premature\" wage increase. Such a situation may be remedied if it falls under the concept of a wage distortion as defined by Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines. However, as already discussed, there is no wage distortion in the case at bench. Not all increases in salary which obliterate the salary differences of certain employees should be perceived as wage distortion.\n\nIn the case of Bankard Employees Union-Workers Alliance Trade Unions v. National Labor Relations Commission , [28] the Court discussed the possible implication of an expanded interpretation of the concept of Wage Distortion, to wit:\n\nIf the compulsory mandate under Article 124 to correct \"wage distortion\" is applied to voluntary and unilateral increases by the employer in fixing hiring rates which is inherently a business judgment prerogative, then the hands of the employer would be completely tied even in cases where an increase in wages of a particular group is justified due to a re-evaluation of the high productivity of a particular group, or as in the present case, the need to increase the competitiveness of Bankard's hiring rate. An employer would be discouraged from adjusting the salary rates of a particular group of employees for fear that it would result to a demand by all employees for a similar increase, especially if the financial conditions the business cannot address an across-the-board increase. [29]\n\nThe Court's ruling in the case of Bankard seek to address and resolve conflicting opinions regarding the true concept of a wage distortion like the one presented in this case whereby a legitimate exercise by an employer of its management prerogative is being taken against it in the guise of an allegation that it is circumventing labor laws. An employer should not be held hostage by the whims and caprices of its employees especially when it has faithfully complied with and executed the terms of the CBA.\n\nIt is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or agreements and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite. [30]\n\nOn a final note, the Court has ruled time and again that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality by the courts when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the CA, in the exercise of its expanded jurisdiction to review findings of the National Labor Relations Commission.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is DENIED .

On April 23, 2008, respondent paid P2,000.00 to the BIR in relation to FAN No. LTDO-122-PEN-2002-00002 for compromise penalties on alleged failure to file summary of sales and purchase from the first and second quarters of 2002.On May 5, 2008, respondent informed the BIR Large Taxpayers District Office (LTDO) of Makati City in a letter dated April 28, 2008, that it availed of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480 and furnished the LTDO with copies of the tax amnesty documents.[9] The said letter was received by the BIR LTDO of Makati City on the same day.On July 10, 2008, petitioner wrote respondent, advising the latter that under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 19-2008, those \"with delinquent accounts/accounts receivable considered as assets of the BIR/ Government, including self-assessed tax,\" are not allowed to avail of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480.[10]On September 8, 2008, petitioner issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDAL) directing the seizure of respondent's goods, chattels or effects, and other personal properties, and/or levy of its real property and interest in/or rights to real property to the extent of P563,168,996.70.[11] A copy of the WDAL was constructively served on respondent's offices on September 11, 2008. On the same day, the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) informed respondent that the latter's account was being put on hold because of the WDAL.The CTA First Division RulingIn an Amended Decision[12] dated February 28, 2012, the CTA First Division ruled that the CTA has jurisdiction not only over decisions or inactions of the CIR in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, but also over other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or other laws administered by the BIR. It declared that petitioner is already barred from collecting from respondent the alleged tax liabilities because it is undisputed that respondent had complied with all the legal requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR its Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN, and Tax Amnesty Payment Form together with the BIR Tax Payment Deposit Slip evidencing payment of amnesty tax amounting to P112,500.00. The CTA First Division added that when respondent complied with all the requirements of R.A. No. 9480, it is deemed to have settled in full all its tax liabilities for the years covered by the tax amnesty. It held that the July 10, 2008 Letter of petitioner is void as it disqualifies respondent from availing of the immunity from payment of tax liabilities under R.A. No. 9480 on the ground that its account has been considered delinquent or receivable asset of the government, which reason is not in consonance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9480. The fallo reads:WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration (from the Decision dated 20 September 2011) dated October 11, 2011 filed by petitioner is hereby GRANTED.Consequently, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 08, 2008 is hereby declared NULL and VOID and of no legal effect. Respondent is now precluded from collecting the amount of P563,168,996.70, representing petitioner's tax liability for taxable year 2002, which is deemed settled.SO ORDERED.[13]Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA First Division in a Resolution[14] dated May 14, 2012. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review before the CTA En Banc.The CTA En Banc RulingIn a Decision[15] dated August 5, 2013, the CTA En Banc opined that it has jurisdiction to rule on the petition because it is not an appeal of the disputed assessment which is subject to a reglementary period, but it is a case to determine whether the issuance of the WDAL is proper. It added that the issue to be addressed is not the timeliness of the protest, but rather, whether petitioner may validly collect taxes from respondent despite the latter having availed of the tax amnesty. The CTA En Banc concluded that respondent properly availed of the immunity from payment of taxes under R.A. No. 9480, and as such, the issuance of a WDAL was invalid, which justified the filing of a petition within 30 days from receipt of the warrant. It disposed the case in this wise:WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Amended Decision dated February 28, 2012, rendered by the First Division of this Court in CTA Case No. 7842, and its Resolution dated May 14, 2012 are AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.SO ORDERED.[16]Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA En Banc on February 19, 2014. Hence, this petition for review on certiorari, wherein petitioner raises the following issues: WHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ASSUMED JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE. WHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO THE IMMUNITIES UNDER THE TAX AMNESTY PROGRAM PROVIDED IN REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9480.[17] Petitioner argues that Section 9 of R.A. No. 9282 provides that a party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the CIR may file an appeal with the CTA within 30 days after the receipt of such decision or ruling; that the 30-day period for filing an appeal with the CTA should be reckoned from respondent's receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, its receipt of the Letter dated July 10, 2008; that it is erroneous to consider receipt of the WDAL as the date of reckoning the period to file an appeal to the CTA because the WDAL is merely a means, an instrument, or a mechanism to implement the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, the July 10, 2008 Letter; that whatever decision, action, or ruling petitioner had with respect to respondent's claims and/or defenses was set forth in the aforementioned issuances and not in the WDAL; and that in providing for the exception that delinquent accounts, or accounts receivable considered assets of the government are not eligible under the tax amnesty program, RMC No. 19-2008 merely supplied the gap in the law where assessments have become final and incontestable upon the lapse of the reglementary period for appeal.[18]In its Comment,[19] respondent counters that the CTA is vested with jurisdiction to determine whether a taxpayer is immune from the payment of taxes insofar as it is given the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal matters arising from the laws administered by the BIR such as tax amnesty statutes; that in Pantoja v. David,[20] the Court ruled that petitions for the annulment of distraint orders of the BIR do not violate the prohibition against injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes because the proceedings were not directed against the right of the BIR to collect per se, but against the right of the BIR to do so by distraint and levy; that while it did not file any petition for review from its receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or the July 10, 2008 Letter, it availed of the tax amnesty on February 29, 2008 by complying with the requirements of R.A. No. 9480; that in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[21] the Court ruled that a taxpayer immediately enjoys the immunities granted by R.A. No. 9480 as soon as the taxpayer complies with the conditions under the law and the BIR may not prevent or delay a taxpayer from immediately enjoying immunity from the payment of taxes by making the tax amnesty application contingent on the BIR's confirmation or agreement; that in Union Bank of the Philippines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[22] decided by the CTA, the latter held that Section 4 of R.A. No. 9480 limits petitioner's remedy to assailing the taxpayer's SALN within a period of one year from the date of filing; that after the one-year period mandated by R.A. No. 9480, the tax amnesty could no longer be disputed by the BIR; and that to allow petitioner to enforce collection of assessments covered by the amnesty availed by respondent through the perfunctory and summary issuance of a WDAL would sanction a disregard of the law, and to punish respondent for its compliance therewith.In its Reply,[23] petitioner contends that the July 10, 2008 Letter was the adverse decision or ruling appealable to the CTA and respondent's receipt of the letter is the proper reckoning point for filing a petition for review with the CTA; that respondent received the said letter on August 5, 2008, thus, it was already apprised of petitioner's adverse decision regarding its application for tax amnesty at that time; that respondent had until September 4, 2008 to appeal the decision, however, respondent's petition for review was filed with the CTA only on October 10, 2008; and that assessments which have become final and executory upon the taxpayer's failure to appeal therefrom are outside the coverage of R.A. No. 9480.The Court's RulingI.A tax amnesty operates as a general pardon or intentional overlooking by the State of its authority to impose penalties on persons otherwise guilty of evasion or violation of a revenue or tax law. It is an absolute forgiveness or waiver by the government of its right to collect what is due it and to give tax evaders who wish to relent a chance to start with a clean slate. A tax amnesty, much like a tax exemption, is never favored nor presumed in law. The grant of a tax amnesty is akin to a tax exemption; thus, it must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.[24]On May 24, 2007, R.A. No. 9480 took effect and authorized the grant of a tax amnesty to qualified taxpayers for all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, that have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005.[25] The pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9480 are:SEC. 1. Coverage. \u2014 There is hereby authorized and granted a tax amnesty which shall cover all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, That have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005: Provided, however, that the amnesty hereby authorized and granted shall not cover persons or cases enumerated under Section 8 hereof.x x x xSEC. 6. Immunities and Privileges. \u2014 Those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty under Section 5 hereof, and have fully complied with all its conditions shall be entitled to the following immunities and privileges:(a) The taxpayer shall be immune from the payment of taxes, as well as additions thereto, and the appurtenant civil, criminal or administrative penalties under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years. (Emphases supplied)x x x xTo implement R.A. No. 9480, the Department of Finance (DOF) issued DOF Department Order No. 29-07 (DO 29-07). Section 6 thereof outlines the method for availing a tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480, viz.:SEC. 6. Method of Availment of Tax Amnesty.1. Forms/Documents to be filed. \u2014 To avail of the general tax amnesty, concerned taxpayers shall file the following documents/requirements:a. Notice of Availment in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR;b. Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005 in such [form], as may be prescribed by the BIR;c. Tax Amnesty Return in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR.2. Place of Filing of Amnesty Tax Return. \u2014 The Tax Amnesty Return, together with the other documents stated in Sec. 6 (1) hereof, shall be filed as follows:a. Residents shall file with the Revenue District Officer (RDO)/Large Taxpayer District Office of the BIR which has jurisdiction over the legal residence or principal place of business of the taxpayer, as the case may be.b. Non-residents shall file with the office of the Commissioner of the BIR, or with the RDO.c. At the option of the taxpayer, the RDO may assist the taxpayer in accomplishing the forms and computing the taxable base and the amnesty tax payable, but may not look into, question or examine the veracity of the entries contained in the Tax Amnesty Return, [SALN], or such other documents submitted by the taxpayer.3. Payment of Amnesty Tax and Full Compliance. \u2014 Upon filing of the Tax Amnesty Return in accordance with Sec. 6 (2) hereof, the taxpayer shall pay the amnesty tax to the authorized agent bank or in the absence thereof, the Collection Agents or duly authorized Treasurer of the city or municipality in which such person has his legal residence or principal place of business.The RDO shall issue sufficient Acceptance of Payment Forms, as may be prescribed by the BIR for the use of \u2014 or to be accomplished by \u2014 the bank, the collection agent or the Treasurer, showing the acceptance by the amnesty tax payment. In case of the authorized agent bank, the branch manager or the assistant branch manager shall sign the acceptance of payment form.The Acceptance of Payment Form, the Notice of Availment, the SALN, and the Tax Amnesty Return shall be submitted to the RDO, which shall be received only after complete payment. The completion of these requirements shall be deemed full compliance with the provisions of [R.A. No.] 9480. x x x (Emphasis supplied)In this case, it remains undisputed that respondent complied with all the requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR a Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN as of December 31, 2005 and Tax Amnesty Payment Form. Further, it paid the corresponding amnesty taxes. Hence, respondent has successfully availed itself of the tax amnesty benefits granted under R.A. No. 9480 which include immunity from \"the appurtenant civil, criminal, or administrative penalties under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years.\"II.The CIR, however, insists that respondent is still liable for deficiency taxes, contending that under RMC No. 19-2008, respondent is disqualified to avail of the tax amnesty because it falls under the exception of \"delinquent accounts or accounts receivable considered as assets by the BIR or the Government, including self-assessed tax.\" In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Aluminum Wheels, Inc.,[26] petitioner therein raised a similar argument which the Court did not sustain and instead ruled that \"in case there is a discrepancy between the law and a regulation issued to implement the law, the law prevails because the rule or regulation cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the law. x x x To give effect to the exception under RMC No. 19-2008 of delinquent accounts or accounts receivable by the BIR, as interpreted by the BIR, would unlawfully create a new exception for availing of the Tax Amnesty Program under [R.A. No.] 9480.\"[27]Moreover, it must be noted that under Section 8 of R.A. No. 9480, only the following persons are disqualified from availing of the tax amnesty:SEC. 8. Exceptions. \u2014 x x x(a) Withholding agents with respect to their withholding tax liabilities;(b) Those with pending cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Commission on Good Government;(c) Those with pending cases involving unexplained or unlawfully acquired wealth or under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act;(d) Those with pending cases filed in court involving violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law;(e) Those with pending criminal cases for tax evasion and other criminal offenses under Chapter II of Title X of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and the felonies of frauds, illegal exactions and transactions, and malversation of public funds and property under Chapters III and IV of Title VII of the Revised Penal Code; and(f) Tax cases subject of final and executory judgment by the courts.[28]It is a basic precept of statutory construction that the express mention of one person, thing, act, or consequence excludes all others as expressed in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In implementing tax amnesty laws, the CIR cannot now insert an exception where there is none under the law. Indeed, a tax amnesty must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. However, the rule-making power of administrative agencies cannot be extended to amend or expand statutory requirements or to embrace matters not originally encompassed by the law. Administrative regulations should always be in accord with the provisions of the statute they seek to implement, and any resulting inconsistency shall be resolved in favor of the basic law.[29]III.As regards the issue on the propriety and timeliness of the petition for review, suffice it to say that in this case, the reckoning point of the 30-day period to appeal the assessments is immaterial because the assessments have already been extinguished by respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480. To sustain petitioner's contention that respondent should have elevated an appeal to the CTA when it received the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at most, when it received the July 10, 2008 Letter of the BIR, would lead to an absurd and unjust situation wherein the taxpayer avails of the benefits of a tax amnesty law, yet the BIR still issues a WDAL simply because the taxpayer did not appeal the assessment to the CTA. The requirement of filing an appeal with the CTA even after the taxpayer has already complied with the requirements of the tax amnesty law negates the amnesty granted to the taxpayer and creates a condition which is not found in the law. It is worthy to note that respondent filed a protest to the assessments, but because of the passage of R.A. No. 9480, it no longer pursued its legal remedies against the assessments. Thus, respondent cannot be faulted for filing a petition for review with the CTA only upon receipt of the WDAL for it rightfully relied on the provision of R.A. No. 9480 that \"those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty x x x, and have fully complied with all its conditions x x x shall be immune from the payment of taxes x x x.\" Finally, in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[30] the Court pronounced that taxpayers may immediately enjoy the privileges and immunities under R.A. No. 9480 as soon as they fulfill the suspensive condition imposed therein, i.e., submission of 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty Form; 2) Tax Amnesty Return Form (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) SALN as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (Acceptance of Payment Form or BIR Form No. 0617). In fine, the deficiency taxes for Fiscal Year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 are deemed settled in view of respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480.WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.

JR., J.:\n\nAssailed in this petition for review on certiorari are the August 5, 2013 Decision [1] and the February 19, 2014 Resolution [2] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 907 which affirmed the February 28, 2012 Amended Decision [3] and the May 14, 2012 Resolution [4] of the CTA First Division in CTA Case No. 7842.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nOn May 30, 2007, respondent Transfield Philippines, Inc. (respondent) received copies of Final Assessment Notice (FAN) Nos. LTDO-122-IT-2002-00014, LTDO-122-WE-2002-00011, LTDO-122-VT-2002-00012, and LTDO-122-PEN-2002-00002 issued by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), through Nestor S. Valeroso, Officer-in-Charge, Assistant Commissioner for the Large Taxpayers Service. [5] Respondent was assessed the total sum of P563,168,996.70 for deficiency income tax, Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT), and Value-Added Tax (VAT), inclusive of interest and compromise penalties for the Fiscal Year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002.

[6] Without acting on respondent's protest, the BIR issued the First Collection Letter [7] dated August 3, 2007, demanding immediate payment of the assessments. Respondent received a copy of the First Collection Letter on August 28, 2007.\n\nThen, on January 17, 2008, petitioner constructively served a Final Notice Before Seizure [8] dated December 20, 2007, to respondent's office.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, respondent availed of the benefits of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9480 by submitting the following documents to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), an authorized agent bank of the BIR: 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty; 2) Tax Amnesty Return (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (BIR Form No. 0617). On the same day, respondent paid the BIR, through DBP, an amnesty tax in the amount of P112,500.00. On April 23, 2008, respondent paid P2,000.00 to the BIR in relation to FAN No. LTDO-122-PEN-2002-00002 for compromise penalties on alleged failure to file summary of sales and purchase from the first and second quarters of 2002.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, respondent informed the BIR Large Taxpayers District Office (LTDO) of Makati City in a letter dated April 28, 2008, that it availed of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480 and furnished the LTDO with copies of the tax amnesty documents. [9] The said letter was received by the BIR LTDO of Makati City on the same day.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, petitioner wrote respondent, advising the latter that under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 19-2008, those \"with delinquent accounts/accounts receivable considered as assets of the BIR/ Government, including self-assessed tax,\" are not allowed to avail of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480. [10]\n\nOn September 8, 2008, petitioner issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDAL) directing the seizure of respondent's goods, chattels or effects, and other personal properties, and/or levy of its real property and interest in/or rights to real property to the extent of P563,168,996.70. [11] A copy of the WDAL was constructively served on respondent's offices on September 11, 2008. On the same day, the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) informed respondent that the latter's account was being put on hold because of the WDAL.\n\nThe CTA First Division Ruling\n\nIn an Amended Decision [12] dated February 28, 2012, the CTA First Division ruled that the CTA has jurisdiction not only over decisions or inactions of the CIR in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, but also over other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or other laws administered by the BIR. It declared that petitioner is already barred from collecting from respondent the alleged tax liabilities because it is undisputed that respondent had complied with all the legal requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR its Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN, and Tax Amnesty Payment Form together with the BIR Tax Payment Deposit Slip evidencing payment of amnesty tax amounting to P112,500.00. The CTA First Division added that when respondent complied with all the requirements of R.A. No. 9480, it is deemed to have settled in full all its tax liabilities for the years covered by the tax amnesty. It held that the July 10, 2008 Letter of petitioner is void as it disqualifies respondent from availing of the immunity from payment of tax liabilities under R.A. No. 9480 on the ground that its account has been considered delinquent or receivable asset of the government, which reason is not in consonance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9480. The fallo reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration (from the Decision dated 20 September 2011) dated October 11, 2011 filed by petitioner is hereby GRANTED.\n\nConsequently, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 08, 2008 is hereby declared NULL and VOID and of no legal effect. Respondent is now precluded from collecting the amount of P563,168,996.70, representing petitioner's tax liability for taxable year 2002, which is deemed settled.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\n\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA First Division in a Resolution [14] dated May 14, 2012. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review before the CTA En Banc.\n\nThe CTA En Banc Ruling\n\nIn a Decision [15] dated August 5, 2013, the CTA En Banc opined that it has jurisdiction to rule on the petition because it is not an appeal of the disputed assessment which is subject to a reglementary period, but it is a case to determine whether the issuance of the WDAL is proper. It added that the issue to be addressed is not the timeliness of the protest, but rather, whether petitioner may validly collect taxes from respondent despite the latter having availed of the tax amnesty. The CTA En Banc concluded that respondent properly availed of the immunity from payment of taxes under R.A. No. 9480, and as such, the issuance of a WDAL was invalid, which justified the filing of a petition within 30 days from receipt of the warrant. It disposed the case in this wise:\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Amended Decision dated February 28, 2012, rendered by the First Division of this Court in CTA Case No. 7842, and its Resolution dated May 14, 2012 are AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [16]\n\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA En Banc on February 19, 2014. Hence, this petition for review on certiorari, wherein petitioner raises the following issues:\n\nWHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ASSUMED JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE.\n\nWHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO THE IMMUNITIES UNDER THE TAX AMNESTY PROGRAM PROVIDED IN REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9480. [17]\n\nPetitioner argues that Section 9 of R.A. No. 9282 provides that a party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the CIR may file an appeal with the CTA within 30 days after the receipt of such decision or ruling; that the 30-day period for filing an appeal with the CTA should be reckoned from respondent's receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, its receipt of the Letter dated July 10, 2008; that it is erroneous to consider receipt of the WDAL as the date of reckoning the period to file an appeal to the CTA because the WDAL is merely a means, an instrument, or a mechanism to implement the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, the July 10, 2008 Letter; that whatever decision, action, or ruling petitioner had with respect to respondent's claims and/or defenses was set forth in the aforementioned issuances and not in the WDAL; and that in providing for the exception that delinquent accounts, or accounts receivable considered assets of the government are not eligible under the tax amnesty program, RMC No. 19-2008 merely supplied the gap in the law where assessments have become final and incontestable upon the lapse of the reglementary period for appeal. [18]\n\nIn its Comment, [19] respondent counters that the CTA is vested with jurisdiction to determine whether a taxpayer is immune from the payment of taxes insofar as it is given the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal matters arising from the laws administered by the BIR such as tax amnesty statutes; that in Pantoja v. David, [20] the Court ruled that petitions for the annulment of distraint orders of the BIR do not violate the prohibition against injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes because the proceedings were not directed against the right of the BIR to collect per se, but against the right of the BIR to do so by distraint and levy; that while it did not file any petition for review from its receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or the July 10, 2008 Letter, it availed of the tax amnesty on February 29, 2008 by complying with the requirements of R.A. No. 9480; that in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [21] the Court ruled that a taxpayer immediately enjoys the immunities granted by R.A. No. 9480 as soon as the taxpayer complies with the conditions under the law and the BIR may not prevent or delay a taxpayer from immediately enjoying immunity from the payment of taxes by making the tax amnesty application contingent on the BIR's confirmation or agreement; that in Union Bank of the Philippines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [22] decided by the CTA, the latter held that Section 4 of R.A. No. 9480 limits petitioner's remedy to assailing the taxpayer's SALN within a period of one year from the date of filing; that after the one-year period mandated by R.A. No. 9480, the tax amnesty could no longer be disputed by the BIR; and that to allow petitioner to enforce collection of assessments covered by the amnesty availed by respondent through the perfunctory and summary issuance of a WDAL would sanction a disregard of the law, and to punish respondent for its compliance therewith.\n\nIn its Reply, [23] petitioner contends that the July 10, 2008 Letter was the adverse decision or ruling appealable to the CTA and respondent's receipt of the letter is the proper reckoning point for filing a petition for review with the CTA; that respondent received the said letter on August 5, 2008, thus, it was already apprised of petitioner's adverse decision regarding its application for tax amnesty at that time; that respondent had until September 4, 2008 to appeal the decision, however, respondent's petition for review was filed with the CTA only on October 10, 2008; and that assessments which have become final and executory upon the taxpayer's failure to appeal therefrom are outside the coverage of R.A. No. 9480.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nI.\n\nA tax amnesty operates as a general pardon or intentional overlooking by the State of its authority to impose penalties on persons otherwise guilty of evasion or violation of a revenue or tax law. It is an absolute forgiveness or waiver by the government of its right to collect what is due it and to give tax evaders who wish to relent a chance to start with a clean slate. A tax amnesty, much like a tax exemption, is never favored nor presumed in law. The grant of a tax amnesty is akin to a tax exemption; thus, it must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. [24]\n\nOn May 24, 2007, R.A. No. 9480 took effect and authorized the grant of a tax amnesty to qualified taxpayers for all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, that have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005. [25] The pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9480 are:\n\nSEC. 1. Coverage. \u2014 There is hereby authorized and granted a tax amnesty which shall cover all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, That have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005: Provided, however, that the amnesty hereby authorized and granted shall not cover persons or cases enumerated under Section 8 hereof.\n\nx x x x\n\nSEC. 6. Immunities and Privileges. \u2014 Those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty under Section 5 hereof, and have fully complied with all its conditions shall be entitled to the following immunities and privileges:\n\n(a) The taxpayer shall be immune from the payment of taxes, as well as additions thereto, and the appurtenant civil, criminal or administrative penalties under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years. (Emphases supplied)\n\nx x x x\n\nTo implement R.A. No. 9480, the Department of Finance (DOF) issued DOF Department Order No. 29-07 (DO 29-07). Section 6 thereof outlines the method for availing a tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480, viz.:\n\nSEC. 6. Method of Availment of Tax Amnesty.\n\n1. Forms/Documents to be filed. \u2014 To avail of the general tax amnesty, concerned taxpayers shall file the following documents/requirements:\na. Notice of Availment in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR;\n\nb. Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005 in such [form], as may be prescribed by the BIR;\n\nc. Tax Amnesty Return in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR.\n\n2. Place of Filing of Amnesty Tax Return. \u2014 The Tax Amnesty Return, together with the other documents stated in Sec. 6 (1) hereof, shall be filed as follows:\na. Residents shall file with the Revenue District Officer (RDO)/Large Taxpayer District Office of the BIR which has jurisdiction over the legal residence or principal place of business of the taxpayer, as the case may be.\n\nb. Non-residents shall file with the office of the Commissioner of the BIR, or with the RDO.\n\nc. At the option of the taxpayer, the RDO may assist the taxpayer in accomplishing the forms and computing the taxable base and the amnesty tax payable, but may not look into, question or examine the veracity of the entries contained in the Tax Amnesty Return, [SALN], or such other documents submitted by the taxpayer.\n\n3. Payment of Amnesty Tax and Full Compliance. \u2014 Upon filing of the Tax Amnesty Return in accordance with Sec. 6 (2) hereof, the taxpayer shall pay the amnesty tax to the authorized agent bank or in the absence thereof, the Collection Agents or duly authorized Treasurer of the city or municipality in which such person has his legal residence or principal place of business.\n\nThe RDO shall issue sufficient Acceptance of Payment Forms, as may be prescribed by the BIR for the use of \u2014 or to be accomplished by \u2014 the bank, the collection agent or the Treasurer, showing the acceptance by the amnesty tax payment. In case of the authorized agent bank, the branch manager or the assistant branch manager shall sign the acceptance of payment form.\n\nThe Acceptance of Payment Form, the Notice of Availment, the SALN, and the Tax Amnesty Return shall be submitted to the RDO, which shall be received only after complete payment. The completion of these requirements shall be deemed full compliance with the provisions of [R.A. No.] 9480. x x x (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn this case, it remains undisputed that respondent complied with all the requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR a Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN as of December 31, 2005 and Tax Amnesty Payment Form. Further, it paid the corresponding amnesty taxes. Hence, respondent has successfully availed itself of the tax amnesty benefits granted under R.A. No. 9480 which include immunity from \"the appurtenant civil, criminal, or administrative penalties under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years.\"\n\nII.\n\nThe CIR, however, insists that respondent is still liable for deficiency taxes, contending that under RMC No. 19-2008, respondent is disqualified to avail of the tax amnesty because it falls under the exception of \"delinquent accounts or accounts receivable considered as assets by the BIR or the Government, including self-assessed tax.\" In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Aluminum Wheels, Inc., [26] petitioner therein raised a similar argument which the Court did not sustain and instead ruled that \"in case there is a discrepancy between the law and a regulation issued to implement the law, the law prevails because the rule or regulation cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the law. x x x To give effect to the exception under RMC No. 19-2008 of delinquent accounts or accounts receivable by the BIR, as interpreted by the BIR, would unlawfully create a new exception for availing of the Tax Amnesty Program under [R.A. No.] 9480.\" [27]\n\nMoreover, it must be noted that under Section 8 of R.A. No. 9480, only the following persons are disqualified from availing of the tax amnesty:\n\nSEC. 8. Exceptions. \u2014 x x x\n\n(a) Withholding agents with respect to their withholding tax liabilities;\n\n(b) Those with pending cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Commission on Good Government;\n\n(c) Those with pending cases involving unexplained or unlawfully acquired wealth or under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act;\n\n(d) Those with pending cases filed in court involving violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law;\n\n(e) Those with pending criminal cases for tax evasion and other criminal offenses under Chapter II of Title X of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and the felonies of frauds, illegal exactions and transactions, and malversation of public funds and property under Chapters III and IV of Title VII of the Revised Penal Code; and\n\n(f) Tax cases subject of final and executory judgment by the courts. [28]\n\nIt is a basic precept of statutory construction that the express mention of one person, thing, act, or consequence excludes all others as expressed in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In implementing tax amnesty laws, the CIR cannot now insert an exception where there is none under the law. Indeed, a tax amnesty must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. However, the rule-making power of administrative agencies cannot be extended to amend or expand statutory requirements or to embrace matters not originally encompassed by the law. Administrative regulations should always be in accord with the provisions of the statute they seek to implement, and any resulting inconsistency shall be resolved in favor of the basic law. [29]\n\nIII.\n\nAs regards the issue on the propriety and timeliness of the petition for review, suffice it to say that in this case, the reckoning point of the 30-day period to appeal the assessments is immaterial because the assessments have already been extinguished by respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480. To sustain petitioner's contention that respondent should have elevated an appeal to the CTA when it received the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at most, when it received the July 10, 2008 Letter of the BIR, would lead to an absurd and unjust situation wherein the taxpayer avails of the benefits of a tax amnesty law, yet the BIR still issues a WDAL simply because the taxpayer did not appeal the assessment to the CTA. The requirement of filing an appeal with the CTA even after the taxpayer has already complied with the requirements of the tax amnesty law negates the amnesty granted to the taxpayer and creates a condition which is not found in the law. It is worthy to note that respondent filed a protest to the assessments, but because of the passage of R.A. No. 9480, it no longer pursued its legal remedies against the assessments. Thus, respondent cannot be faulted for filing a petition for review with the CTA only upon receipt of the WDAL for it rightfully relied on the provision of R.A. No. 9480 that \"those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty x x x, and have fully complied with all its conditions x x x shall be immune from the payment of taxes x x x.\" Finally, in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [30] the Court pronounced that taxpayers may immediately enjoy the privileges and immunities under R.A. No. 9480 as soon as they fulfill the suspensive condition imposed therein, i.e., submission of 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty Form; 2) Tax Amnesty Return Form (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) SALN as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (Acceptance of Payment Form or BIR Form No. 0617). In fine, the deficiency taxes for Fiscal Year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 are deemed settled in view of respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.

KIMURA AND YUICHIRO KIMURA, PETITIONERS.D E C I S I O N BERSAMIN, C.J.: The petitioners implore us to determine whether or not the illegitimate child of the spouse of an adopting alien falls within the ambit of the clause \"relative by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" contained in Section 7 (b)(i) and (iii), Article III, of Republic Act No. 8552, otherwise known as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998, which pertinently provides:SEC. 7. Who May Adopt. - The following may adopt:x x x x(b) Any alien possessing the same qualifications as above stated for Filipino nationals: Provided, That his/her country has diplomatic relations with the Republic of the Philippines, that he/she has been living in the Philippines for at least three (3) continuous years prior to the filing of the application for adoption and maintains such residence until the adoption decree is entered, that he/she has been certified by his/her diplomatic or consular office or any appropriate government agency that he/she has the legal capacity to adopt in his/her country, and that his/her government allows the adoptee to enter his/her country as his/her adopted son/daughter: Provided, further, That the requirements on residency and certification of the alien's qualification to adopt in his/her country may be waived for the following:(i) a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity; or(ii) one who seeks to adopt the legitimate son/daughter of his/her Filipino spouse; or(iii) one who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his/her spouse a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity of the Filipino spouses; x x x. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)The CaseThis appeal seeks to reverse and undo the judgment and order by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 33, in Davao City on February 14, 2012[1] and January 22, 2013,[2] respectively, dismissing their petition for the adoption of the minor Jan Aurel Maghanoy Bulayo (Jan Aurel) in SP. Proc. No. 10, 718-2010, and denying their motion for reconsideration.AntecedentsThe antecedent facts are as follows:Spouses Mary Jane B. Kimura, a Filipino national, and Yuichiro Kimura, a Japanese national, got married on June 12, 2004.Prior thereto, petitioner Mary Jane gave birth to her son Jan Aurel on November 24, 1997. However, she was not married to her son's biological father, Jun Baldoza, thus making Jan Aurel her illegitimate child. Her last communication with the minor's father was when she was four (4) months pregnant with [Jan Aurel]. From then on, she has no knowledge of his whereabouts.On March 15, 2009, petitioners filed a joint petition for adoption of Jan Aurel seeking, among others, to have him declared as their legitimate son, enjoying the rights and observing the duties of an adopted child as provided by law.During trial, petitioners presented the Department of Social Welfare and Development Minor's Case Study and Home Study Report which recommended approval of said petition.Likewise, petitioners presented the following documents to show that they are in possession of full civil capacity and legal rights to adopt, of good moral character, have not been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude, and emotionally and psychologically capable of caring for children, x x x.[3]Specifically, the petitioners presented the following documents to support their petition for adoption, namely; (1) the marriage contract of the petitioners; (2) the permanent registration in Japan of petitioner Yuichiro Kimura (Yuichiro); (3) the medical certificates issued to the petitioners; (4) the neuro-psychological reports for the petitioners; (5) the certificates of attendance in adoption orientation conducted by Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD); (6) the NBI clearances issued to the petitioners; (7) the police clearances of the petitioners; (8) the Prosecutor's clearances issued to the petitioners; (9) the court clearances of the petitioners; (10) the income tax return of Yuichiro; (11) the certificate of employment Yuichiro.Nonetheless, on February 14, 2012, the RTC denied the petition for adoption because Yuichiro, being a Japanese citizen, did not comply with the requirements laid down under Section 7 of R.A. No. 8552 and Section 7 of Administrative Matter No. 02-6-02-SC.[4] The RTC observed that Yuichiro was not exempt from the residency and certification requirements under Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 8552 because Jan Aurel was the illegitimate child of co-petitioner Mary Jane Kimura (Mary Jane).[5]Hence, this direct appeal by petition for review on certiorari.IssuesThe petitioners hereby raise the following questions of law, to wit:(1) Whether or not an illegitimate child is within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity in the contemplation of Section 7(b)(iii) of R.A. No. 8552;(2) Whether or not an illegitimate child is contemplated in Section 7(b)(ii) of R.A. No. 8552; and,(3) Whether or not the existence of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Japan is within judicial notice of the courts.[6]Decisive is the correct interpretation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552, particularly the clause \"a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity\"?Ruling of the CourtThe appeal has merit.I. Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. 8552 should extend and apply even to illegitimate childrenIn contending that the RTC should have granted their petition for adoption, the petitioners emphasize that they are exempt from the requirements for the reason that Jan Aurel was a relative by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree of Mary Jane. They insist that Section 7 necessarily includes all relatives \u2013 whether legitimate or illegitimate \u2013 within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity; that an illegitimate child is a relative within the first degree of consanguinity of the biological mother or father; that excluding an illegitimate child from the contemplation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552 is tantamount to saying that it is easier for an alien spouse to jointly adopt with the Filipino spouse the latter's cousin, a relative within the fourth degree, or the nephew or niece, a relative. within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity,[7] than the Filipino spouse's own biological child.The petitioners' insistence is upheld.A relative is either a \"kinsman\" or \"a person connected with another by blood or affinity.\"[8] Under the Civil Code, the degree of relationship is determined as follows:RelationshipARTICLE 963. Proximity of relationship is determined by the number of generations. Each generation forms a degree.ARTICLE 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.A direct line is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants.x x x xARTICLE 965. The direct line is either descending or ascending. x x x xARTICLE 966. In the line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations or persons, excluding the progenitor.In the direct line, ascent is made to the common ancestor. Thus, the child is one degree removed from the parent, two from the grandfather, and three from the great-grandparent.Pursuant to the foregoing, an illegitimate child is a relative within the first civil degree of consanguinity of his biological mother. Unlike a nephew and niece, an illegitimate child belongs to the direct maternal lineage, which is never uncertain,[9] and which is not as remote as the nephew and niece. The word \"child\" referred to in Article 966 of the Civil Code is used in a general term and is without qualification. This is so because the provision contemplates blood relation, not status. When the provision does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate relatives, we, too, must not. Let us adhere to the Latin maxim that declares: ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguera debemus (where the law does not distinguish, nor the interpreter must distinguish).To put more clarity on the legislative intent, we refer to the deliberations on Senate Bill No. 1523 (now, R.A. No. 8552) in identifying who can adopt and who may be adopted under Section 7(b), Article III, of R.A. No. 8552, to wit:The President. x x xIn respect to former Filipino citizen referred to in line 2 of page 6-- meaning the exception where aliens may adopt-- why are relatives here limited to those by consanguinity and it does not include those who are so by affinity?Senator Santiago. This is a reflection of a native cultural bias, or prejudice in favor of blood relations. This is a peculiarly Asian world view.The President. So, the committee has no intention of expanding this to include relatives by affinity.Senator Santiago. If there are reasonable grounds for advancing an argument, the committee would be happy to consider it.The President. Up to what degree of relatives by consanguinity or affinity, up to what degree?Senator Santiago. Generally, in trial courts, this phrase is construed in an open-ended way. As long as there is a tie of consanguinity, no matter how remote, then it falls under the coverage of this exception.The President. Is that the clear intention of this provision?Senator Santiago. Yes, Mr. President. x x x x Senator Maceda. x x xNow, I support the stand of the Senate President on the question of consanguinity or affinity, especially if this former Filipino citizen is probably going to leave again. If the idea is, as stated, to try to encourage more adoptions, especially for those who have some relations, the matter of allowing relatives by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree, in my opinion, should be allowed.So if the Senate President will propose that amendment, I shall certainly support it.Now, still on page 6 (b) and (c), I see the difference here. It says: \"(b) One who seeks to adopt the legitimate child OR CHILDREN of his or her Filipino spouse; [or]\"(c) One who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his or her spouse a relative by consanguinity of the latter.\"This is basically the same except, probably, the difference is the joint adoption. Would that be correct?Senator Santiago. Under paragraph (b), the subject is only the legitimate child. But under paragraph (c), the subject is a bigger group, because it covers relatives by consanguinity who do not necessarily have to be children.Senator Maceda. Exactly, Mr. President. On the other hand, a legitimate child is also within the ambit of relative by consanguinity. Is that not correct?Senator Santiago. That is correct, Mr. President.x x x x[10] (Emphasis supplied)GONZALES AMENDMENTSMay the Chair offer this amendment? In line 3, delete the semicolon (;) and add the following phrase: OR, AFFINITY WITHIN THE FOURTH CIVIL DEGREE.Senator Santiago. May I please just clarify? It would now read: \"...who seeks to adopt a relative by consanguinity OR AFFINITY WITHIN THE FOURTH CIVIL DEGREE.\" So the limitation on civil degree will apply to both consanguinity and affinity?The President. That is correct. That is the intention of the amendment.Senator Santiago. I am delighted to accept the amendment, Mr. President.The President. Is there any objection? [Silence] There being none, the amendment is approved.[11]Although Senate Bill No. 1523 originally indicated that the exception should only cover relatives by consanguinity, the lawmakers were in agreement during the period of individual amendments to include the phrase \"or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" in order to expand the coverage to more children or relatives under the preferential exception embodied in Section 7. The reason was stated in Section 2 of the law, which declares that it is the State's policy \"to ensure that every child remains under the care and custody of his/her parent(s) and be provided with love, care, understanding and security towards the full and harmonious development of his/her personality.\"R.A. No. 8552 undoubtedly intended to include Jan Aurel, the biological child of Mary Jane, in the term \"relatives\" under Section 7(b)(iii) because he was her relative within the first civil degree. Finding otherwise would engender a situation where the alien adopter would be able to undergo a speedy and less expensive adoption process by being able to adopt, say, his Filipina spouse's nephew or niece instead of the Filipino spouse's own child.It is relevant to note that the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) joins the petitioners' position, and emphasizes that \"if the law exempts the alien adopter from residency and certification requirements if he/she will adopt the brother/sister, nephew/niece or cousin of his/her Filipino spouse (who are within the 4th civil degree of consanguinity or affinity), then there is no reason to exclude the application of the said exemption if the adoptee is the illegitimate child of the said Filipino spouse.\"[12]At any rate, had the legislators intended that only the legitimate children were contemplated by Section 7(b)(i) and (iii), then Congress should have been written the law as explicitly. Indeed, Congress did so in Section 7(b)(ii)[13] by including the term \"legitimate\" to describe the children contemplated by that clause. Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) clearly covered both legitimate and illegitimate relatives as long as they were within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity.II Courts may take judicial notice of the existence of diplomatic relationsbetween the Philippines and JapanThe petitioners assert that their petition for adoption has indicated the existence of the diplomatic relations between Philippines and Japan, but they did not anymore prove the same during the trial because the existence of such diplomatic relations was within the judicial notice of the courts.[14]The OSG has not refuted the petitioners' assertion.Section 1 and Section 2, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court state:Section 1. Judicial notice, when mandatory. \u2014 A court shall take judicial notice, without the introduction of evidence, of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of the Philippines, the official acts of legislative, executive and judicial departments of the Philippines, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions. (1a)Section 2. Judicial notice, when discretionary. \u2014 A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable to unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions.The courts of the Philippines are bound to take judicial notice of the existence of the diplomatic relations between our country and Japan pursuant to both Section 1 and Section 2, supra. Diplomatic relations form part of the official acts of the Executive Department of our Government. They are also matters of public knowledge.There is no dispute, indeed, that the Philippines and Japan have had a long history of diplomatic relations.[15] In 1888, Japan already established a diplomatic office in Manila, and expanded it as a Consulate General in 1919. Eventually, Japan declared its office in Manila an embassy in 1943 during the Japanese occupation of the country. Both countries were also signatories to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an indication that they wished to have a more prominent diplomatic presence in each other by sending of diplomatic missions. This further shows that both countries, being signatories to the Vienna Convention, aimed to have the representation of the interests of the sending state and promoting friendly relations with the receiving state.[16] The countless efforts to maintain their diplomatic relations no longer required the presentation of proof of the existence of diplomatic relations.WHEREFORE, the Court GRANTS the petition for review on certiorari; REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the judgment and order rendered, respectively, on February 14, 2012 and January 22, 2013 by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 33, in Davao City in SP.

KIMURA AND YUICHIRO KIMURA, PETITIONERS.D E C I S I O N\nIN RE: PETITION FOR ADOPTION OF JAN AUREL MAGHANOY BULAYO WITH APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF NAME OF ADOPTEE FROM \"JAN AUREL MAGHANOY BULAYO\" TO \"JAN AUREL BULAYO KIMURA,\"\n\nSPOUSES MARY JANE B. KIMURA AND YUICHIRO KIMURA, PETITIONERS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nBERSAMIN, C.J.:\n\nThe petitioners implore us to determine whether or not the illegitimate child of the spouse of an adopting alien falls within the ambit of the clause \"relative by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" contained in Section 7 (b)(i) and (iii), Article III, of Republic Act No. 8552, otherwise known as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998 , which pertinently provides:\n\nSEC. 7. Who May Adopt. - The following may adopt:\n\nx x x x\n\n(b) Any alien possessing the same qualifications as above stated for Filipino nationals: Provided, That his/her country has diplomatic relations with the Republic of the Philippines, that he/she has been living in the Philippines for at least three (3) continuous years prior to the filing of the application for adoption and maintains such residence until the adoption decree is entered, that he/she has been certified by his/her diplomatic or consular office or any appropriate government agency that he/she has the legal capacity to adopt in his/her country, and that his/her government allows the adoptee to enter his/her country as his/her adopted son/daughter: Provided, further, That the requirements on residency and certification of the alien's qualification to adopt in his/her country may be waived for the following:\n\n(i) a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity ; or\n\n(ii) one who seeks to adopt the legitimate son/daughter of his/her Filipino spouse; or\n\n(iii) one who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his/her spouse a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity of the Filipino spouses; x x x. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)\n\nThe Case\n\nThis appeal seeks to reverse and undo the judgment and order by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 33, in Davao City on February 14, 2012 [1] and January 22, 2013, [2] respectively, dismissing their petition for the adoption of the minor Jan Aurel Maghanoy Bulayo (Jan Aurel) in SP. Proc. No. 10, 718-2010, and denying their motion for reconsideration.\n\nAntecedents\n\nThe antecedent facts are as follows:\n\nSpouses Mary Jane B. Kimura, a Filipino national, and Yuichiro Kimura, a Japanese national, got married on June 12, 2004.\n\nPrior thereto, petitioner Mary Jane gave birth to her son Jan Aurel on November 24, 1997. However, she was not married to her son's biological father, Jun Baldoza, thus making Jan Aurel her illegitimate child. Her last communication with the minor's father was when she was four (4) months pregnant with [Jan Aurel]. From then on, she has no knowledge of his whereabouts.\n\nOn March 15, 2009, petitioners filed a joint petition for adoption of Jan Aurel seeking, among others, to have him declared as their legitimate son, enjoying the rights and observing the duties of an adopted child as provided by law.\n\nDuring trial, petitioners presented the Department of Social Welfare and Development Minor's Case Study and Home Study Report which recommended approval of said petition.\n\nLikewise, petitioners presented the following documents to show that they are in possession of full civil capacity and legal rights to adopt, of good moral character, have not been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude, and emotionally and psychologically capable of caring for children, x x x. [3]\n\nSpecifically, the petitioners presented the following documents to support their petition for adoption, namely; (1) the marriage contract of the petitioners; (2) the permanent registration in Japan of petitioner Yuichiro Kimura (Yuichiro); (3) the medical certificates issued to the petitioners; (4) the neuro-psychological reports for the petitioners; (5) the certificates of attendance in adoption orientation conducted by Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD); (6) the NBI clearances issued to the petitioners; (7) the police clearances of the petitioners; (8) the Prosecutor's clearances issued to the petitioners; (9) the court clearances of the petitioners; (10) the income tax return of Yuichiro; (11) the certificate of employment Yuichiro.\n\nNonetheless, on February 14, 2012, the RTC denied the petition for adoption because Yuichiro, being a Japanese citizen, did not comply with the requirements laid down under Section 7 of R.A. No. 8552 and Section 7 of Administrative Matter No. 02-6-02-SC. [4] The RTC observed that Yuichiro was not exempt from the residency and certification requirements under Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 8552 because Jan Aurel was the illegitimate child of co-petitioner Mary Jane Kimura (Mary Jane). [5]\n\nHence, this direct appeal by petition for review on certiorari .\n\nIssues\n\nThe petitioners hereby raise the following questions of law, to wit:\n\n(1) Whether or not an illegitimate child is within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity in the contemplation of Section 7(b)(iii) of R.A. No. 8552;\n\n(2) Whether or not an illegitimate child is contemplated in Section 7(b)(ii) of R.A. No. 8552; and,\n\n(3) Whether or not the existence of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Japan is within judicial notice of the courts. [6]\n\nDecisive is the correct interpretation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552, particularly the clause \"a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity\" ?\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe appeal has merit.\n\nI.\nSection 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. 8552 should\nextend and apply even to illegitimate children\n\nIn contending that the RTC should have granted their petition for adoption, the petitioners emphasize that they are exempt from the requirements for the reason that Jan Aurel was a relative by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree of Mary Jane. They insist that Section 7 necessarily includes all relatives \u2013 whether legitimate or illegitimate \u2013 within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity; that an illegitimate child is a relative within the first degree of consanguinity of the biological mother or father; that excluding an illegitimate child from the contemplation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552 is tantamount to saying that it is easier for an alien spouse to jointly adopt with the Filipino spouse the latter's cousin, a relative within the fourth degree, or the nephew or niece, a relative. within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity, [7] than the Filipino spouse's own biological child.\n\nThe petitioners' insistence is upheld.\n\nA relative is either a \"kinsman\" or \"a person connected with another by blood or affinity.\" [8] Under the Civil Code , the degree of relationship is determined as follows:\n\nRelationship\n\nARTICLE 963. Proximity of relationship is determined by the number of generations. Each generation forms a degree.\n\nARTICLE 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.\n\nA direct line is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants.\n\nx x x x\n\nARTICLE 965. The direct line is either descending or ascending.\n\nx x x x\n\nARTICLE 966. In the line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations or persons, excluding the progenitor.\n\nIn the direct line, ascent is made to the common ancestor. Thus, the child is one degree removed from the parent, two from the grandfather, and three from the great-grandparent.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing, an illegitimate child is a relative within the first civil degree of consanguinity of his biological mother. Unlike a nephew and niece, an illegitimate child belongs to the direct maternal lineage, which is never uncertain, [9] and which is not as remote as the nephew and niece. The word \"child\" referred to in Article 966 of the Civil Code is used in a general term and is without qualification. This is so because the provision contemplates blood relation, not status. When the provision does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate relatives, we, too, must not. Let us adhere to the Latin maxim that declares: ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguera debemus (where the law does not distinguish, nor the interpreter must distinguish).\n\nTo put more clarity on the legislative intent, we refer to the deliberations on Senate Bill No. 1523 (now, R.A. No. 8552) in identifying who can adopt and who may be adopted under Section 7(b), Article III, of R.A. No. 8552, to wit:\n\nThe President. x x x\n\nIn respect to former Filipino citizen referred to in line 2 of page 6-- meaning the exception where aliens may adopt-- why are relatives here limited to those by consanguinity and it does not include those who are so by affinity?\n\nSenator Santiago. This is a reflection of a native cultural bias, or prejudice in favor of blood relations. This is a peculiarly Asian world view.\n\nThe President. So, the committee has no intention of expanding this to include relatives by affinity.\n\nSenator Santiago. If there are reasonable grounds for advancing an argument, the committee would be happy to consider it.\n\nThe President. Up to what degree of relatives by consanguinity or affinity, up to what degree?\n\nSenator Santiago. Generally, in trial courts, this phrase is construed in an open-ended way. As long as there is a tie of consanguinity, no matter how remote, then it falls under the coverage of this exception.\n\nThe President. Is that the clear intention of this provision?\n\nSenator Santiago. Yes, Mr. President.\n\nx x x x\n\nSenator Maceda. x x x\n\nNow, I support the stand of the Senate President on the question of consanguinity or affinity, especially if this former Filipino citizen is probably going to leave again. If the idea is, as stated, to try to encourage more adoptions, especially for those who have some relations, the matter of allowing relatives by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree, in my opinion, should be allowed.\n\nSo if the Senate President will propose that amendment, I shall certainly support it.\n\nNow, still on page 6 (b) and (c), I see the difference here. It says:\n\n\"(b) One who seeks to adopt the legitimate child OR CHILDREN of his or her Filipino spouse; [or]\n\n\"(c) One who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his or her spouse a relative by consanguinity of the latter.\"\nThis is basically the same except, probably, the difference is the joint adoption. Would that be correct?\n\nSenator Santiago. Under paragraph (b), the subject is only the legitimate child. But under paragraph (c), the subject is a bigger group, because it covers relatives by consanguinity who do not necessarily have to be children.\n\nSenator Maceda. Exactly, Mr. President. On the other hand, a legitimate child is also within the ambit of relative by consanguinity. Is that not correct?\n\nSenator Santiago. That is correct, Mr. President.\n\nx x x x [10] (Emphasis supplied)\n\nGONZALES AMENDMENTS\n\nMay the Chair offer this amendment? In line 3, delete the semicolon (;) and add the following phrase: OR, AFFINITY WITHIN THE FOURTH CIVIL DEGREE.\n\nSenator Santiago. May I please just clarify? It would now read: \"...who seeks to adopt a relative by consanguinity OR AFFINITY WITHIN THE FOURTH CIVIL DEGREE.\" So the limitation on civil degree will apply to both consanguinity and affinity?\n\nThe President. That is correct. That is the intention of the amendment.\n\nSenator Santiago. I am delighted to accept the amendment, Mr. President.\n\nThe President. Is there any objection? [Silence] There being none, the amendment is approved. [11]\n\nAlthough Senate Bill No. 1523 originally indicated that the exception should only cover relatives by consanguinity, the lawmakers were in agreement during the period of individual amendments to include the phrase \"or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" in order to expand the coverage to more children or relatives under the preferential exception embodied in Section 7. The reason was stated in Section 2 of the law, which declares that it is the State's policy \"to ensure that every child remains under the care and custody of his/her parent(s) and be provided with love, care, understanding and security towards the full and harmonious development of his/her personality.\"\n\nR.A. No. 8552 undoubtedly intended to include Jan Aurel, the biological child of Mary Jane, in the term \"relatives\" under Section 7(b)(iii) because he was her relative within the first civil degree. Finding otherwise would engender a situation where the alien adopter would be able to undergo a speedy and less expensive adoption process by being able to adopt, say, his Filipina spouse's nephew or niece instead of the Filipino spouse's own child.\n\nIt is relevant to note that the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) joins the petitioners' position, and emphasizes that \"if the law exempts the alien adopter from residency and certification requirements if he/she will adopt the brother/sister, nephew/niece or cousin of his/her Filipino spouse (who are within the 4 th civil degree of consanguinity or affinity), then there is no reason to exclude the application of the said exemption if the adoptee is the illegitimate child of the said Filipino spouse.\" [12]\n\nAt any rate, had the legislators intended that only the legitimate children were contemplated by Section 7(b)(i) and (iii), then Congress should have been written the law as explicitly. Indeed, Congress did so in Section 7(b)(ii) [13] by including the term \"legitimate\" to describe the children contemplated by that clause. Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) clearly covered both legitimate and illegitimate relatives as long as they were within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity.\n\nII\nCourts may take judicial notice\nof the existence of diplomatic relations\nbetween the Philippines and Japan\n\nThe petitioners assert that their petition for adoption has indicated the existence of the diplomatic relations between Philippines and Japan, but they did not anymore prove the same during the trial because the existence of such diplomatic relations was within the judicial notice of the courts. [14]\n\nThe OSG has not refuted the petitioners' assertion.\n\nSection 1 and Section 2, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court state:\n\nSection 1.

No. 249406, March 9, 2021] REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER-OPPOSITOR, MORE ELECTRIC AND POWER CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. PANAY ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC., RESPONDENT. R E S O L U T I O N CARANDANG, J.: For resolution is the Motion for Reconsideration[1] filed by respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) of the Court's Decision[2] dated September 15, 2020 of this Court, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, the instant Petitions are GRANTED. The assailed Judgment dated July 1, 2019 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Section 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 are DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL. SO ORDERED.[3] (Emphasis in the original) Antecedents On July 23, 2018, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11212[4] was enacted granting petitioner More Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212[5] confers on MORE the authority to exercise the right of eminent domain. The distribution system, which is presently being used in Iloilo City, comprises of \"five 5 sub-transmission line substations, 450 kilometers of electrical lines, 20,000 poles, 1,300 transformers and 64,000 electrical meters\"[6] owned by PECO, a holder of the franchise since 1922.[7] The franchise of PECO expired on January 18, 2019 and no new franchise had been issued in its favor. Nonetheless, since MORE has not established its service yet, Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 permits PECO to continue operating the existing distribution system during the interim period.[8] Accordingly, through a Provisional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) that the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on May 21, 2019 issued, PECO continues to operate its existing distribution system.[9] The same provision also states that even if PECO is operating the distribution system, the interim arrangement shall not prevent MORE from acquiring the system through the exercise of the right of eminent domain. Incidentally, on March 6, 2019, PECO filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief[10] docketed as Civil Case No. R-MND-19-00571 assailing the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, arguing that these provisions encroach on its constitutional right to due process[11] and equal protection.[12] PECO alleged that the authority granted to MORE to takeover PECO's business by seizing its assets under the veil of expropriation cannot be done without violating its right to substantive due process.[13] PECO also pointed out provisions in R.A. No. 11212 that are not present in other legislative franchises granted to distribution utilities and that MORE is given more leeway in its exercise of the right of eminent domain as compared to other distribution utilities.[14] For PECO, the grant of authority to expropriate all of its assets is arbitrary and unduly oppressive.[15] PECO also claimed that R.A. No. 11212 authorized taking that is not for public use.[16] Meanwhile, on March 11, 2019, MORE filed a Complaint for Expropriation with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City over the distribution system of PECO in the same city.[17] On March 14, 2019, the RTC issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the commencement of expropriation proceedings, the takeover by MORE of the distribution system in Iloilo City, and the issuance of a CPCN by the ERC in favor of MORE.[18] On July 1, 2019, upon motion by PECO for judgment on the pleadings, the RTC rendered its Judgment,[19] the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Section 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212 void and unconstitutional for infringing on PECO's rights to due process and equal protection of the law. Consequently, PECO has no obligation to sell and respondent has no right to expropriate PECO's assets under Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212; and, PECO's rights to its properties are protected against arbitrary and confiscatory taking under the relevant portions of Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212. Finally, the Temporary Restraining Order dated 14 March 2019 insofar as it enjoins respondent MORE and/ or any of its representatives from enforcing, implementing and exercising any of the rights and obligations set forth under RA 11212, including but not limited to commencing or pursuing the expropriation proceedings against petitioner PECO under the assailed provisions; and takeover by respondent MORE of petitioner PECO's distribution assets in the franchise area is hereby made permanent. SO ORDERED.[20] The RTC found the element of public use wanting in the present case. The RTC explained that PECO's properties, including the distribution assets, are already being devoted to public use and that the only tangible effect of the exercise of eminent domain is to replace PECO with MORE as the owner of the existing electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. For the RTC, the State should not intervene in this corporate take-over.[21] The RTC also held that there is no substantial distinction between MORE, on the one hand, and all other distribution utilities, on the other, to warrant the unwarranted benefits granted to MORE.[22] MORE filed a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 before this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 248061, raising the constitutional question of whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate the constitutional guarantee of due process and equal protection of laws. It posed the legal question in this wise: \"[m]ay the distribution assets of a power distribution company whose franchise has expired, be acquired by a new power distribution utility with the new franchise, through expropriation, to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted service in the franchise area?\"[23] MORE argued that expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves the distinct emergency public purpose of ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City, as the city transitions from the old franchise holder to the new franchise holder. Sections 10 and 17 recognize that MORE is differently situated from other distribution utilities. For one, there is already an existing distribution system in Iloilo City that continues to burden public space. This distribution system occupies streets, land, and properties owned by the government. MORE further averred that the clear legislative intent under R.A. No. 11212 is for MORE, as the new franchisee, to take over the operation of the distribution system in Iloilo City and to pay just compensation to PECO. A separate petition for review on certiorari was filed by the Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), docketed as G.R. No. 249406. The OSG argued that R.A. No. 9136,[24] otherwise known as the \"Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001\" (EPIRA) delegated to public utilities like MORE the power of eminent domain to enable them to exercise their public function. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 emphasized a specific public need, which is to ease the transition of operations from PECO to MORE by expressly providing that the right of MORE to expropriate the distribution system of PECO for the public purpose of electricity and power distribution system, will not be prejudiced by the interim authority given to PECO to continue to operate the said system for the very same purpose of power distribution. On motion[25] of PECO, G.R. Nos. 248061 and 249406 were consolidated.Decision dated September 15, 2020 of this Court On September 15, 2020, this Court rendered its Decision reversing and setting aside the Decision dated July 1, 2019 of the RTC. The Court declared Sections 1 0 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 constitutional. The Court held that: (1) the legislative franchise of PECO authorizing it to operate a distribution system in Iloilo City is susceptible to expropriation for the same public purpose of power and electricity distribution; and (2) the expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO pursuant to Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is in accordance with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of laws. The Court took into account the history of the legislative franchises governing the distribution system in Iloilo City which established that the distribution system of PECO can be subjected to expropriation for the same public purpose. Further, the Court ruled that the expropriation of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying Rower and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity. PECO'S Motion for Reconsideration In its Motion for Reconsideration,[26] PECO asks the Court to take a second hard look at the facts surrounding the case and the alleged far-reaching legal implications of the Decision dated September 15, 2020. PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to.[27] While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, this power maybe exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, should it desire to operate and maintain the system by itself, and not by private entities such as MORE.[28] Additionally, PECO disagrees with the conclusion of the Court that its ownership of the distribution system is co-existent with its franchise. PECO insists that franchise merely pertains to the privilege granted by the government and not synonymous to ownership of the facilities used thereof.[29] Further, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer of its distribution system to MORE. PECO alleges that the inexperience and incompetence of MORE in the business of electric distribution adversely affects the public.[30] PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use and is privately owned by PECO, it can devote the same to private use; such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. PECO proposes that MORE should establish, operate, and maintain its own distribution system.[31] PECO maintains that the expropriation of its distribution system violates its right to due process of law. According to PECO, to successfully invoke the exercise of eminent domain, it is required that there is a compelling state interest and that the means employed to effect it should be least restrictive.[32] Lastly, PECO insists that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate its constitutional right to equal protection of laws because MORE was given undue and unwarranted benefits[33] and for having been singled out as the only entity against whom expropriation may be directed.[34]MORE's Opposition MORE counters that PECO's distribution assets are not sacrosanct private property that PECO has absolute discretion on how and when to dispose. The distribution system assets are regulated assets established for the sole purpose of supplying electricity to end-users in Iloilo City. MORE avers that PECO had no more right to occupy public streets and skyline when its franchise expired, thus, PECO had the obligation to uproot, dismantle and remove its posts, wires, transformers, and electric meters from the streets and skyline of Iloilo City. The public space that they occupy are now under easement for use of MORE under its franchise. MORE posits that the cost of regulated assets have been charged to and paid for by the consumers in Iloilo City. The consumers of Iloilo City have the right to the continued use of these regulated assets to serve their basic need for electricity, as provided for under the EPIRA. Further, MORE contends that to require it to build a new distribution system is anti-consumer and would deny the consumers of Iloilo City their right to continued service. The determination of MORE's technical competence and capability to operate the distribution system in Iloilo City is a matter within the primary jurisdiction of the ERC. Also, the matter of just compensation is an issue which must be resolved in the expropriation court.Issue The primary issue to be resolved is whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are constitutional. Ruling of the Court After a careful review of the arguments raised by PECO, the Court finds no reason to depart from its Decision dated September 15, 2020. The issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration have been squarely and extensively discussed in the Court's Decision dated September 15, 2020. Nonetheless, the Court deems it prudent to clarity and discuss further the matters raised in the Motion. A franchise emanates from the constitutional power of the Legislature to grant concessions and privileges to private entities. A franchise stated out as a \"royal privilege or (a) branch of the King's prerogative, subsisting in the hands of a subject.\"[35] This definition was given by Finch, adopted by Blackstone, and accepted by every authority since.[36] Further, \"a franchise is defined to be a special privilege to, do certain things conferred by government on an individual or corporation, and which does not belong to citizens generally of common right.\"[37] Insofar as the great powers of government are concerned, \"[a] franchise is basically a legislative grant of a special privilege to a person.\"[38] Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution further states that \"x x x for the operation of a public utility,\" no \"such franchise or right [shall] be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. x x x\" Pursuant to this prerogative of the State, Section 27 of the EPIRA vests on Congress the power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity, to wit: Section Franchising Power in the Electric Power Sector. - The power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity shall be vested exclusively in the Congress of the Philippines and all laws inconsistent with this Act particularly, but not limited to, Section 43 of PD 269, otherwise known as the \"National Electrification Decree\", are hereby deemed repealed or modified accordingly: Provided, That all existing franchises shall be allowed to their full term: Provided, further, That in the case of electric cooperatives, renewals and cancellations shall remain with the National Electrification Commission under the National Electrification Administration for five (5) more years after the enactment of this Act. Since 1923 until January 18, 2019, PECO was the holder of a franchise to \"establish, operate, and maintain, for commercial purposes and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the City of Iloilo.\"[39] However, upon the expiration of PECO's franchise in 2019, Congress, exercising its constitutionally-mandated and plenary power to grant franchises, did not renew the privilege given to PECO. Instead, it awarded the franchise to MORE, as embodied in R.A. No. 11212. The power of Congress to award the franchise to MORE is broad and plenary, subject only to limitations given by the Constitution and the fundamental principle of due process. It is beyond the power of the Court to question the wisdom of Congress in granting the franchise to MORE. The Court cannot venture into this because that would mean violating the deep-rooted principle of separation of powers. Thus, Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, giving MORE the power to expropriate the distribution system of PECO, are but integral parts of the grant of the franchise by Congress. Since the exercise of eminent domain is necessary to carry out the franchise, it is prudent that the Court accords respect to the legislative will. The authority granted to MORE under its franchise to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO is a valid delegation of power. In its motion for reconsideration, PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to. While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, it also asserts that this power may be exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, and not by private entities such as MORE. PECO's argument fails to convince the Court. The power of eminent domain is exercised by the Legislature. However, it may be delegated by Congress to the President, administrative bodies, local government units, and even to private enterprises performing public services.[40] The exercise of the right to expropriate given to MORE under its franchise is a delegated authority granted by Congress. The restrictive view that expropriation may be exercised by the State alone, without any consideration for the State's authority to delegate its powers, cannot be upheld. Being a private enterprise allowed by the Congress to operate a public utility for public interest, the delegation by Congress of the power to expropriate PECO's distribution system is valid. The requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain are present. Over the years and in a plethora of cases, this Court has recognized the following requisites for the valid exercise of the power of eminent domain: (1) the property taken must be private property; (2) there must be genuine necessity to take the private property; (3) the taking must be for public use; (4) there must be payment of just compensation; and (5) the taking must comply with due process of law.[41] It is settled that a property already devoted to public use can still be subject to expropriation, provided this is done directly by the national legislature or under a specific grant of authority to a delegate,[42] as in the case of MORE. In this case, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer through expropriation of its distribution system to MORE. PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use, it can devote the same to private use, such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. In other words, PECO zeroes in on the alleged absence of the second and third requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain. It is established that the foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is genuine necessity, and that necessity must be of a public character. As a rule, the determination of whether there is genuine necessity for the exercise is a justiciable question. However, when the power is exercised by the Legislature, the question of necessity is essentially a matter that the Legislature can decide and determine. Thus, in City of Manila v. Chinese Community,[43] the Court held: The legislature, in providing for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, may directly determine the necessity for appropriating private property for a particular improvement for public use, and it may select the exact location of the improvement. In such a case, it is well-settled that the utility of the proposed improvement, the extent of the public necessity for its construction, the expediency of constructing it, the suitableness of the location selected and the consequent necessity of taking the land selected for its site, are all questions exclusively for the legislature to determine, and the courts have no power to interfere, or to substitute their own views for those of the representatives of the people.[44] As in this case, the express authority of MORE to expropriate is embodied in R.A. No. 11212. The expropriation of the distribution system of PECO was directed by legislation. To validly exercise the power of eminent domain, it is also required that taking should be for public use. The meaning of the term \"public use\" has evolved over time in response to changing public needs and exigencies. Public use, which was traditionally understood as strictly limited to actual \"use by the public,\" has developed an expansive meaning. \"Public use\" is now synonymous with \"public interest,\" \"public benefit,\" and \"public convenience.\"[45] At present, it may not be amiss to state that whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use.[46] In this case, expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is for the general purpose of electricity distribution. Electricity distribution no doubt affects the public welfare. The assailed provisions ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition from the old to the new franchisee. Iloilo City's public space is already burdened by PECO's existing distribution system. Yet, the distribution system cannot continue to operate under PECO's franchise as this has not been renewed by Congress. The public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is clear in Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 when it authorized MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system. The provision reads: Section 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2013 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:Provided, further, That upon the filing of the petition tor expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. The distinct genuine public necessity is reiterated in Section 17 thereof which allowed MORE to initiate expropriation proceedings even if PECO is provisionally operating the distribution system. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 states: Section 17. Transition of Operations. - In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC which period shall in no case exceed two (2) from the grant of this legislative franchise. Upon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC. This provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it. To reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise. The grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations. An information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area. The grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws. The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area. It must be highlighted that in carrying out the obligations of MORE in its legislative franchise, time is of the essence. MORE is only given two years from the grant of the legislative franchise, or from July 23, 2018, to either establish its own distribution system or acquire the existing distribution system through the exercise of eminent domain. This is consistent with the State's objective of ensuring uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city. MORE considered it practical to exercise the power of eminent domain as there are already existing structures which would facilitate unimpeded transition from PECO to MORE. In National Electrification Administration v. Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc.,[47] the Court recognized the authority of National Electrification Administration (NEA) under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269, to order the transfer of the distribution assets of Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc. to Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. the new franchise holder. Under PD No. 269, NEA had the power to acquire assets which includes the exercise of the right to eminent domain. The Court upheld NEA's right of eminent domain necessary in the pursuit of the declared policy of nationwide electrification. Notably in the said case, the transfer of distribution assets involves two private entities pursuant to the enforcement of the right to exercise eminent domain. Recently approved on August 8, 2019 is R.A. No. 11361,[48] otherwise known as the \"Anti-Obstruction of Power Lines Act,\" which recognized the policy of the State to ensure uninterrupted conveyance of electricity from generating plants to end-users. It further acknowledged that the uninterrupted conveyance of electricity is a matter of national security and is essential to sustaining the country's economic development. Section 13 of the same Act provides for the right of eminent domain granted to any person with a franchise to operate, manage, or maintain the electric power line as governed by the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court. In sum, expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying power and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity. The allegation of PECO that it was singled-out and the perceived incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE do not render Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 unconstitutional. Contrary to the claim of PECO, it was not singled-out. There was also no undue benefit given to MORE to justify the invalidation of Sections 10 and 17 of its legislative franchise. The right to exercise eminent domain conferred by Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 remains valid, regardless of any perceived incidental benefit to be gained or enjoyed by MORE, for as long as the requisites for the exercise of a valid expropriation was complied with. 1 There is no basis to support the claim of PECO that it has been \"singled\u00ad out\" by the approval of the franchise of MORE. There is only one franchise holder in the subject area prior to the enactment of R.A. No. 11212. It is but natural and expected that PECO, as the lone previous franchise holder which failed to secure the renewal of its franchise, will be averse to any arid all subsequent franchise holder exercising the right of eminent domain. Nonetheless, this does not mean that PECO can simply ask the nullification of the legislative franchise awarded to MORE for being \"singled-out.\" It must be emphasized that a legislative franchise is merely a privilege and not a right that may be demanded by any individual or entity. The Court cannot substitute the judgment of the Congress with its own with respect to the determination of which entity it deems most qualified to carry out the distribution of electricity in Iloilo City. It must be remembered that the Constitution has delineated separate and quite distinct roles that each branch of government must fill. In the exercise of judicial review, the Court is limited to the determination of the constitutionality of R.A. No. 11212. The Court does not possess the technical knowledge required in the field of power distribution to competently evaluate the capacity of MORE to carry out its functions under R.A. No. 11212. Resolving whether PECO deserves to be granted an extension or renewal of its franchise and whether MORE is qualified as a new franchisee are matters clearly beyond the ambit or the Court's authority to review as these are purely matters left to the wisdom of Congress. Likewise, the incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE does not render its legislative franchise unconstitutional. As fittingly explained by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa in his Separate Opinion,[49] x x x [W]hile the exercise of the power of eminent domain over the electric power distribution facilities of PECO may garner benefits in favor of MORE, this would be but incidental. Notably, its duties as a public utility would nonetheless remain regulated by the government. At the end of the day, at the proper expropriation proceedings instituted for the purpose, the abiding reality would be for the court to be satisfied with evidence proffered by MORE \u2013 that its intended taking would invariably be for the good of the public, is actually necessary, and that there is just compensation therefor.[50] It is important to highlight that the incidental private benefit MORE enjoys does not override the paramount public interest on which the right of eminent domain is hinged. It would be unfair for the public to be deprived of access to uninterrupted supply of electricity, an important tool to economic growth, simply because of some incidental benefit MORE may gain from its legislative franchise. Moreover, as aptly pointed out by Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe in her Separate Opinion,[51] MORE is not the only entity engaged in the business of distribution utilities accorded with a similar authority to exercise eminent domain embedded in a legislative franchise. The respective legislative franchises of the following entities contain a similar provision: (1) Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc.\u2013PPALMA (under R.A. No. 11322); (2) Cotabato Light and Power Company (under R.A. No. 10637); (3) First Bay Power Corp. (under R.A. No. 10891); (4) Angeles Electric Corporation (under R.A. No. 9381); and (5) Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company, Inc. (under R.A. No. 10373).[52] It is erroneous for PECO to argue that only the State and its subdivisions or the local government units may exercise the power of eminent domain. Noticeably, these franchise holders are cooperatives and private corporations. Therefore, it cannot simply be concluded that the Congress, in enacting R.A. No. 11212, extended favorable concessions to MORE to the exclusion of all other distribution utilities because other private entities such as the cooperatives and private corporations mentioned enjoy similar privileges. It is also worthy to point out that MORE is under a unique circumstance and is faced with an unusual obstacle. It is mandated to assume the operations of PECO, whose facilities are already existing and occupied by its employees, while simultaneously ensuring that the distribution of electricity to various areas in Iloilo City remain uninterrupted during the interim period. Though not impossible to accomplish, the Congress deemed it prudent to confer the power provided in Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 to guaranty that the transition phase will not hamper the duty of the franchisee to supply electric power, an essential necessity in the lives of people residing in Iloilo City. The Court, speaking through the ponencia of Associate Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr., explained that: MORE is a new franchise holder that is virtually deprived of the option to set up a new distribution system, not only because the existing public space is burdened with the distribution system of the old franchise holder, but also because it must hit the ground running and ensure the uninterrupted and continuous supply of electricity to the city. MORE is therefore peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise.[53] Clearly, in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City who rely on the distribution system of PECO. There is no question that PECO's franchise was not renewed, thus, it can no longer operate the distribution system in Iloilo City. MORE, as the new franchisee, is mandated under Section 2 of R.A. No. 11212 to operate and maintain the distribution system in the best manner possible. To be able to do so, its right to expropriate the distribution system in Iloilo City to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity should not be hampered by unfounded allegations of undue benefit and corporate takeover. In the end, the net public benefit generated from the exercise of the right of eminent domain outweighs any and all incidental and secondary benefit any private entity, including MORE, may acquire. In view of the foregoing, the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 must be upheld.WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.SO ORDERED.Peralta, C.J., Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa, Gesmundo, Hernando, Rosario, and Lopez, JJ., concur.Leonen and Lazaro-Javier, JJ., dissent.

(PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and its complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC, which period shall in no case exceed two (2) years from the grant of this legislative franchise. Upon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the necessary provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC. This provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it. To reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise. The grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations. An information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area. The grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws. The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area.[9] Rollo (G .R. No. 248061), p. 288. [10] Id. at 60-95.

DISSENTING OPINION LEONEN, J.: I reiterate the statements I made in my September 15, 2020 Dissent.[1] Sections 10[2] and 17[3] of Republic Act No. 11212 are unconstitutional. They violate the equal protection clause, granting electricity franchise to a corporation strikingly inexperienced in supplying electricity. The provisions unduly discriminate against other public utilities, especially the former electric utility operating in Iloilo City, as well as those similarly situated to the new franchisee but, for reasons unclear, were not given the same concessions. Worse, the private property taken is not for public use. All that Sections 10 and 17 allow is a transfer of property from one private corporation to another for the same public purpose to which it was originally devoted. The inefficient monopolistic operation of the electric utility in Iloilo city remains, with no real improvement. In reality, the taking here only serves private interests, and whatever benefit the public gets is only incidental. The Motion for Reconsideration should therefore be granted and the Decision of the Mandaluyong trial court affirmed.I While broad and plenary,[4] as the majority states, the power of Congress to grant franchises for the operation of a public utility is always subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The foremost limitation is provided in Section 1 of the Bill of Rights: \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.\" In my September 15, 2020 Dissent, I outlined how Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates the equal protection clause. The right of eminent domain delegated to More Electric Power Corporation (More Electric) constitutes class legislation\u2014a law that discriminates against some but favors others.[5] Reading Section 10 in isolation will not lead to this conclusion. However, when read in conjunction with the eminent domain provisions of other electricity franchises, the unwarranted benefits granted to More Electric becomes apparent. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 provides: SECTION 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:Provided, further, That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. (Emphasis supplied) On the other hand, the eminent domain provision in Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (Panay Electric) expired franchise states: SECTION 4. It is expressly provided that in the event the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself the system and enterprise herein authorized, the grantee shall surrender its franchise and will turn over to the government all equipment therein at fair market value. As can be gleaned from the provisions, More Electric may exercise its delegated power of eminent domain over properties \"previously, currently or actually used . . . for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users\" in Iloilo City. These properties are no other than those used by the former electric utility, Panay Electric. Further, Section 10 allows More Electric to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric by mere payment of the full amount of their assessed value. This is in contrast to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 5360, Panay Electric's expired franchise, which allows the government itself: not a mere delegate like More Electric, to exercise its power of eminent domain upon payment of fair market value. Assessed value being a mere percentage of the fair market value,[6] it is clear that Section 10 allows More Electric to exercise its delegated eminent domain powers by paying a significantly lower amount compared to what the government would have paid had it expropriated the properties of Panay Electric. This difference in the payable amount is a clear benefit to More Electric. This difference is highlighted further by comparing Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 with the eminent domain provisions found in legislative franchises of other electric utilities.

The court may appoint a grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles, wires, and other facilities over and across public property, including streets, highways, forest reserves, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid.

The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles, wires, and other facilities over and across public property, including streets, highways, forest reserves, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities.

The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid.SEC. 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient maintenance and operation of services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles, wires, and other facilities over and across public property, including streets, highways, forest reserves, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted: Provided, That proper condemnation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid.Apart from having a more detailed eminent domain provision, Republic Act No. 11212, in Section 17,[7] even allows More Electric to acquire the workforce of Panay Electric. No provisions similar to Section 17 can be found in the legislative franchises of other electric utilities. These differences matter because More Electric has no experience in the business of supplying electricity. To be an allowable discrimination under the equal protection clause, the discrimination must, at the very least, be reasonable.[8] Indulging a corporation with all of these benefits, when it has no expertise in the business it seeks to operate, cannot be reasonable. This unreasonableness is more glaring considering that the supply of electricity is a business imbued with public interest.II Moreover, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution as it allows the taking of private property not for public use. The definition of \"public use\" has evolved from the literal \"actual use by the public\" to \"public purpose,\"[9] \"'public advantage or benefit,\"[10] and \"public welfare.\"[11] Admittedly, the supply of electricity is one for public advantage and benefit. Nevertheless, if property is taken for the same public use to which it was originally devoted, there is no true expropriation. As early as 1921, this Court in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government[12] noted how \"the meaning of the term 'public use' [is] one of constant growth\"[13] and that \"[a]s society advances, its demands upon the individual increase and each demand is a new use to which the resources of the individual may be devoted.\"[14] This implies that a true expropriation requires a new a public use. Thus, if property is taken then subsequently devoted to the same public use, there is only a transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change as to who the profits.[15] Therefore, the taking primarily serves proprietary interests, with little to no regard to the interests of the public. Any public interest is only a pretense or incidental at best. More Electric seeks to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric for the continued and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City. This is the exact same public use to which Panay Electric devoted its properties. It must be emphasized that More Electric has no experience in electricity distribution and has no assets of its own to distribute electricity in Iloilo City. The electricity distribution system, even the workforce that would be operating the system, will be the same. All this case involves is a forced transfer of properties from Panay Electric to More Electric. The taking is not for public use but in the service of proprietary interests. The majority concludes with this: \"in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City.\" [16] I cannot see this. All I see is a law giving a semblance of legitimacy to what actually is an abuse of the expropriation powers of the State. I therefore dissent.IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, I vote to GRANT the Motion for Reconsideration and AFFIRM the July 1, 2019 Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 209, Mandaluyong City in Civil Case No. R\u00adMND-1900571.[1] Dissenting Opinion of J.

PANAY ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCARANDANG, J.:\n\nFor resolution is the Motion for Reconsideration [1] filed by respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) of the Court's Decision [2] dated September 15, 2020 of this Court, the dispositive portion of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE , the instant Petitions are GRANTED . The assailed Judgment dated July 1, 2019 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Section 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 are DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL .\n\nSO ORDERED. [3] (Emphasis in the original)\n\nAntecedents\n\nOn July 23, 2018, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11212 [4] was enacted granting petitioner More Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 [5] confers on MORE the authority to exercise the right of eminent domain.\n\nThe distribution system, which is presently being used in Iloilo City, comprises of \"five 5 sub-transmission line substations, 450 kilometers of electrical lines, 20,000 poles, 1,300 transformers and 64,000 electrical meters\" [6] owned by PECO, a holder of the franchise since 1922. [7] The franchise of PECO expired on January 18, 2019 and no new franchise had been issued in its favor.\n\nNonetheless, since MORE has not established its service yet, Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 permits PECO to continue operating the existing distribution system during the interim period. [8] Accordingly, through a Provisional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) that the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on May 21, 2019 issued, PECO continues to operate its existing distribution system. [9] The same provision also states that even if PECO is operating the distribution system, the interim arrangement shall not prevent MORE from acquiring the system through the exercise of the right of eminent domain.\n\nIncidentally, on March 6, 2019, PECO filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief [10] docketed as Civil Case No. R-MND-19-00571 assailing the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, arguing that these provisions encroach on its constitutional right to due process [11] and equal protection. [12] PECO alleged that the authority granted to MORE to takeover PECO's business by seizing its assets under the veil of expropriation cannot be done without violating its right to substantive due process. [13] PECO also pointed out provisions in R.A. No. 11212 that are not present in other legislative franchises granted to distribution utilities and that MORE is given more leeway in its exercise of the right of eminent domain as compared to other distribution utilities. [14] For PECO, the grant of authority to expropriate all of its assets is arbitrary and unduly oppressive. [15] PECO also claimed that R.A. No. 11212 authorized taking that is not for public use. [16]\n\nMeanwhile, on March 11, 2019, MORE filed a Complaint for Expropriation with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City over the distribution system of PECO in the same city. [17]\n\nOn March 14, 2019, the RTC issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the commencement of expropriation proceedings, the takeover by MORE of the distribution system in Iloilo City, and the issuance of a CPCN by the ERC in favor of MORE. [18]\n\nOn July 1, 2019, upon motion by PECO for judgment on the pleadings, the RTC rendered its Judgment, [19] the dispositive portion of which states:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Section 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212 void and unconstitutional for infringing on PECO's rights to due process and equal protection of the law. Consequently, PECO has no obligation to sell and respondent has no right to expropriate PECO's assets under Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212; and, PECO's rights to its properties are protected against arbitrary and confiscatory taking under the relevant portions of Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212.\n\nFinally, the Temporary Restraining Order dated 14 March 2019 insofar as it enjoins respondent MORE and/ or any of its representatives from enforcing, implementing and exercising any of the rights and obligations set forth under RA 11212, including but not limited to commencing or pursuing the expropriation proceedings against petitioner PECO under the assailed provisions; and takeover by respondent MORE of petitioner PECO's distribution assets in the franchise area is hereby made permanent.\n\nSO ORDERED. [20]\n\nThe RTC found the element of public use wanting in the present case. The RTC explained that PECO's properties, including the distribution assets, are already being devoted to public use and that the only tangible effect of the exercise of eminent domain is to replace PECO with MORE as the owner of the existing electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. For the RTC, the State should not intervene in this corporate take-over. [21] The RTC also held that there is no substantial distinction between MORE, on the one hand, and all other distribution utilities, on the other, to warrant the unwarranted benefits granted to MORE. [22]\n\nMORE filed a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 before this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 248061, raising the constitutional question of whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate the constitutional guarantee of due process and equal protection of laws. It posed the legal question in this wise: \"[m]ay the distribution assets of a power distribution company whose franchise has expired, be acquired by a new power distribution utility with the new franchise, through expropriation, to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted service in the franchise area?\" [23]\n\nMORE argued that expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves the distinct emergency public purpose of ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City, as the city transitions from the old franchise holder to the new franchise holder. Sections 10 and 17 recognize that MORE is differently situated from other distribution utilities. For one, there is already an existing distribution system in Iloilo City that continues to burden public space. This distribution system occupies streets, land, and properties owned by the government. MORE further averred that the clear legislative intent under R.A. No. 11212 is for MORE, as the new franchisee, to take over the operation of the distribution system in Iloilo City and to pay just compensation to PECO.\n\nA separate petition for review on certiorari was filed by the Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), docketed as G.R. No. 249406. The OSG argued that R.A. No. 9136, [24] otherwise known as the \"Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001\" (EPIRA) delegated to public utilities like MORE the power of eminent domain to enable them to exercise their public function. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 emphasized a specific public need, which is to ease the transition of operations from PECO to MORE by expressly providing that the right of MORE to expropriate the distribution system of PECO for the public purpose of electricity and power distribution system, will not be prejudiced by the interim authority given to PECO to continue to operate the said system for the very same purpose of power distribution.\n\nOn motion [25] of PECO, G.R. Nos. 248061 and 249406 were consolidated.\n\nDecision dated September 15, 2020 of this Court\n\nOn September 15, 2020, this Court rendered its Decision reversing and setting aside the Decision dated July 1, 2019 of the RTC. The Court declared Sections 1 0 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 constitutional. The Court held that: (1) the legislative franchise of PECO authorizing it to operate a distribution system in Iloilo City is susceptible to expropriation for the same public purpose of power and electricity distribution; and (2) the expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO pursuant to Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is in accordance with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of laws. The Court took into account the history of the legislative franchises governing the distribution system in Iloilo City which established that the distribution system of PECO can be subjected to expropriation for the same public purpose. Further, the Court ruled that the expropriation of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying Rower and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity.\n\nPECO'S Motion for Reconsideration\n\nIn its Motion for Reconsideration, [26] PECO asks the Court to take a second hard look at the facts surrounding the case and the alleged far-reaching legal implications of the Decision dated September 15, 2020. PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to. [27] While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, this power maybe exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, should it desire to operate and maintain the system by itself, and not by private entities such as MORE. [28] Additionally, PECO disagrees with the conclusion of the Court that its ownership of the distribution system is co-existent with its franchise. PECO insists that franchise merely pertains to the privilege granted by the government and not synonymous to ownership of the facilities used thereof. [29]\n\nFurther, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer of its distribution system to MORE. PECO alleges that the inexperience and incompetence of MORE in the business of electric distribution adversely affects the public. [30] PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use and is privately owned by PECO, it can devote the same to private use; such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. PECO proposes that MORE should establish, operate, and maintain its own distribution system. [31]\n\nPECO maintains that the expropriation of its distribution system violates its right to due process of law. According to PECO, to successfully invoke the exercise of eminent domain, it is required that there is a compelling state interest and that the means employed to effect it should be least restrictive. [32]\n\nLastly, PECO insists that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate its constitutional right to equal protection of laws because MORE was given undue and unwarranted benefits [33] and for having been singled out as the only entity against whom expropriation may be directed. [34]\n\nMORE's Opposition\n\nMORE counters that PECO's distribution assets are not sacrosanct private property that PECO has absolute discretion on how and when to dispose. The distribution system assets are regulated assets established for the sole purpose of supplying electricity to end-users in Iloilo City. MORE avers that PECO had no more right to occupy public streets and skyline when its franchise expired, thus, PECO had the obligation to uproot, dismantle and remove its posts, wires, transformers, and electric meters from the streets and skyline of Iloilo City. The public space that they occupy are now under easement for use of MORE under its franchise. MORE posits that the cost of regulated assets have been charged to and paid for by the consumers in Iloilo City. The consumers of Iloilo City have the right to the continued use of these regulated assets to serve their basic need for electricity, as provided for under the EPIRA.\n\nFurther, MORE contends that to require it to build a new distribution system is anti-consumer and would deny the consumers of Iloilo City their right to continued service. The determination of MORE's technical competence and capability to operate the distribution system in Iloilo City is a matter within the primary jurisdiction of the ERC. Also, the matter of just compensation is an issue which must be resolved in the expropriation court.\n\nIssue\n\nThe primary issue to be resolved is whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are constitutional.\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nAfter a careful review of the arguments raised by PECO, the Court finds no reason to depart from its Decision dated September 15, 2020.\n\nThe issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration have been squarely and extensively discussed in the Court's Decision dated September 15, 2020. Nonetheless, the Court deems it prudent to clarity and discuss further the matters raised in the Motion.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nA franchise emanates from the constitutional power of the Legislature to grant concessions and privileges to private entities.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nA franchise emanates from the constitutional power of the Legislature to grant concessions and privileges to private entities.\n\nA franchise stated out as a \"royal privilege or (a) branch of the King's prerogative, subsisting in the hands of a subject.\" [35] This definition was given by Finch, adopted by Blackstone, and accepted by every authority since. [36] Further, \"a franchise is defined to be a special privilege to, do certain things conferred by government on an individual or corporation, and which does not belong to citizens generally of common right.\" [37] Insofar as the great powers of government are concerned, \"[a] franchise is basically a legislative grant of a special privilege to a person.\" [38] Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution further states that \"x x x for the operation of a public utility,\" no \"such franchise or right [shall] be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. x x x\"\n\nPursuant to this prerogative of the State, Section 27 of the EPIRA vests on Congress the power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity, to wit:\n\nSection Franchising Power in the Electric Power Sector. - The power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity shall be vested exclusively in the Congress of the Philippines and all laws inconsistent with this Act particularly, but not limited to, Section 43 of PD 269, otherwise known as the \"National Electrification Decree\", are hereby deemed repealed or modified accordingly: Provided, That all existing franchises shall be allowed to their full term: Provided, further, That in the case of electric cooperatives, renewals and cancellations shall remain with the National Electrification Commission under the National Electrification Administration for five (5) more years after the enactment of this Act.\n\nSince 1923 until January 18, 2019, PECO was the holder of a franchise to \"establish, operate, and maintain, for commercial purposes and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the City of Iloilo.\" [39] However, upon the expiration of PECO's franchise in 2019, Congress, exercising its constitutionally-mandated and plenary power to grant franchises, did not renew the privilege given to PECO. Instead, it awarded the franchise to MORE, as embodied in R.A. No. 11212.\n\nThe power of Congress to award the franchise to MORE is broad and plenary, subject only to limitations given by the Constitution and the fundamental principle of due process. It is beyond the power of the Court to question the wisdom of Congress in granting the franchise to MORE. The Court cannot venture into this because that would mean violating the deep-rooted principle of separation of powers. Thus, Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, giving MORE the power to expropriate the distribution system of PECO, are but integral parts of the grant of the franchise by Congress. Since the exercise of eminent domain is necessary to carry out the franchise, it is prudent that the Court accords respect to the legislative will.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe authority granted to MORE under its franchise to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO is a valid delegation of power.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe authority granted to MORE under its franchise to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO is a valid delegation of power.\n\nIn its motion for reconsideration, PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to. While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, it also asserts that this power may be exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, and not by private entities such as MORE.\n\nPECO's argument fails to convince the Court.\n\nThe power of eminent domain is exercised by the Legislature. However, it may be delegated by Congress to the President, administrative bodies, local government units, and even to private enterprises performing public services . [40]\n\nThe exercise of the right to expropriate given to MORE under its franchise is a delegated authority granted by Congress. The restrictive view that expropriation may be exercised by the State alone, without any consideration for the State's authority to delegate its powers, cannot be upheld. Being a private enterprise allowed by the Congress to operate a public utility for public interest, the delegation by Congress of the power to expropriate PECO's distribution system is valid.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain are present.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain are present.\n\nOver the years and in a plethora of cases, this Court has recognized the following requisites for the valid exercise of the power of eminent domain: (1) the property taken must be private property; (2) there must be genuine necessity to take the private property; (3) the taking must be for public use; (4) there must be payment of just compensation; and (5) the taking must comply with due process of law. [41]\n\nIt is settled that a property already devoted to public use can still be subject to expropriation, provided this is done directly by the national legislature or under a specific grant of authority to a delegate, [42] as in the case of MORE.\n\nIn this case, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer through expropriation of its distribution system to MORE. PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use, it can devote the same to private use, such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. In other words, PECO zeroes in on the alleged absence of the second and third requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain.\n\nIt is established that the foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is genuine necessity, and that necessity must be of a public character. As a rule, the determination of whether there is genuine necessity for the exercise is a justiciable question. However, when the power is exercised by the Legislature, the question of necessity is essentially a matter that the Legislature can decide and determine. Thus, in City of Manila v. Chinese Community , [43] the Court held:\n\nThe legislature, in providing for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, may directly determine the necessity for appropriating private property for a particular improvement for public use, and it may select the exact location of the improvement. In such a case, it is well-settled that the utility of the proposed improvement, the extent of the public necessity for its construction, the expediency of constructing it, the suitableness of the location selected and the consequent necessity of taking the land selected for its site, are all questions exclusively for the legislature to determine, and the courts have no power to interfere, or to substitute their own views for those of the representatives of the people. [44]\n\nAs in this case, the express authority of MORE to expropriate is embodied in R.A. No. 11212. The expropriation of the distribution system of PECO was directed by legislation.\n\nTo validly exercise the power of eminent domain, it is also required that taking should be for public use. The meaning of the term \"public use\" has evolved over time in response to changing public needs and exigencies. Public use, which was traditionally understood as strictly limited to actual \"use by the public,\" has developed an expansive meaning. \"Public use\" is now synonymous with \"public interest,\" \"public benefit,\" and \"public convenience.\" [45] At present, it may not be amiss to state that whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use. [46]\n\nIn this case, expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is for the general purpose of electricity distribution. Electricity distribution no doubt affects the public welfare. The assailed provisions ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition from the old to the new franchisee. Iloilo City's public space is already burdened by PECO's existing distribution system. Yet, the distribution system cannot continue to operate under PECO's franchise as this has not been renewed by Congress.\n\nThe public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is clear in Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 when it authorized MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system. The provision reads:\n\nSection 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2013 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided , That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:\n\nProvided , further, That upon the filing of the petition tor expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.\n\nThe distinct genuine public necessity is reiterated in Section 17 thereof which allowed MORE to initiate expropriation proceedings even if PECO is provisionally operating the distribution system. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 states:\n\nSection 17. Transition of Operations. - In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC which period shall in no case exceed two (2) from the grant of this legislative franchise.\n\nUpon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC.\n\nThis provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it.\n\nTo reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise.\n\nThe grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations.\n\nAn information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area.\n\nThe grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws. The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area.\n\nIt must be highlighted that in carrying out the obligations of MORE in its legislative franchise, time is of the essence. MORE is only given two years from the grant of the legislative franchise, or from July 23, 2018, to either establish its own distribution system or acquire the existing distribution system through the exercise of eminent domain. This is consistent with the State's objective of ensuring uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city. MORE considered it practical to exercise the power of eminent domain as there are already existing structures which would facilitate unimpeded transition from PECO to MORE.\n\nIn National Electrification Administration v. Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc ., [47] the Court recognized the authority of National Electrification Administration (NEA) under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269, to order the transfer of the distribution assets of Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc. to Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. the new franchise holder. Under PD No. 269, NEA had the power to acquire assets which includes the exercise of the right to eminent domain. The Court upheld NEA's right of eminent domain necessary in the pursuit of the declared policy of nationwide electrification. Notably in the said case, the transfer of distribution assets involves two private entities pursuant to the enforcement of the right to exercise eminent domain.\n\nRecently approved on August 8, 2019 is R.A. No. 11361, [48] otherwise known as the \"Anti-Obstruction of Power Lines Act,\" which recognized the policy of the State to ensure uninterrupted conveyance of electricity from generating plants to end-users. It further acknowledged that the uninterrupted conveyance of electricity is a matter of national security and is essential to sustaining the country's economic development. Section 13 of the same Act provides for the right of eminent domain granted to any person with a franchise to operate, manage, or maintain the electric power line as governed by the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court.\n\nIn sum, expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying power and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe allegation of PECO that it was singled-out and the perceived incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE do not render Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 unconstitutional.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe allegation of PECO that it was singled-out and the perceived incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE do not render Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 unconstitutional.\n\nContrary to the claim of PECO, it was not singled-out. There was also no undue benefit given to MORE to justify the invalidation of Sections 10 and 17 of its legislative franchise. The right to exercise eminent domain conferred by Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 remains valid, regardless of any perceived incidental benefit to be gained or enjoyed by MORE, for as long as the requisites for the exercise of a valid expropriation was complied with. 1\n\nThere is no basis to support the claim of PECO that it has been \"singled\u00ad out\" by the approval of the franchise of MORE. There is only one franchise holder in the subject area prior to the enactment of R.A. No. 11212. It is but natural and expected that PECO, as the lone previous franchise holder which failed to secure the renewal of its franchise, will be averse to any arid all subsequent franchise holder exercising the right of eminent domain. Nonetheless, this does not mean that PECO can simply ask the nullification of the legislative franchise awarded to MORE for being \"singled-out.\"\n\nIt must be emphasized that a legislative franchise is merely a privilege and not a right that may be demanded by any individual or entity. The Court cannot substitute the judgment of the Congress with its own with respect to the determination of which entity it deems most qualified to carry out the distribution of electricity in Iloilo City. It must be remembered that the Constitution has delineated separate and quite distinct roles that each branch of government must fill. In the exercise of judicial review, the Court is limited to the determination of the constitutionality of R.A. No. 11212. The Court does not possess the technical knowledge required in the field of power distribution to competently evaluate the capacity of MORE to carry out its functions under R.A. No. 11212. Resolving whether PECO deserves to be granted an extension or renewal of its franchise and whether MORE is qualified as a new franchisee are matters clearly beyond the ambit or the Court's authority to review as these are purely matters left to the wisdom of Congress.\n\nLikewise, the incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE does not render its legislative franchise unconstitutional. As fittingly explained by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa in his Separate Opinion, [49]\n\nx x x [W]hile the exercise of the power of eminent domain over the electric power distribution facilities of PECO may garner benefits in favor of MORE, this would be but incidental. Notably, its duties as a public utility would nonetheless remain regulated by the government. At the end of the day, at the proper expropriation proceedings instituted for the purpose, the abiding reality would be for the court to be satisfied with evidence proffered by MORE \u2013 that its intended taking would invariably be for the good of the public, is actually necessary, and that there is just compensation therefor. [50]\n\nIt is important to highlight that the incidental private benefit MORE enjoys does not override the paramount public interest on which the right of eminent domain is hinged. It would be unfair for the public to be deprived of access to uninterrupted supply of electricity, an important tool to economic growth, simply because of some incidental benefit MORE may gain from its legislative franchise.\n\nMoreover, as aptly pointed out by Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe in her Separate Opinion, [51] MORE is not the only entity engaged in the business of distribution utilities accorded with a similar authority to exercise eminent domain embedded in a legislative franchise. The respective legislative franchises of the following entities contain a similar provision: (1) Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc.\u2013PPALMA (under R.A. No. 11322); (2) Cotabato Light and Power Company (under R.A. No. 10637); (3) First Bay Power Corp. (under R.A. No. 10891); (4) Angeles Electric Corporation (under R.A. No. 9381); and (5) Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company, Inc. (under R.A. No. 10373). [52]\n\nIt is erroneous for PECO to argue that only the State and its subdivisions or the local government units may exercise the power of eminent domain. Noticeably, these franchise holders are cooperatives and private corporations. Therefore, it cannot simply be concluded that the Congress, in enacting R.A. No. 11212, extended favorable concessions to MORE to the exclusion of all other distribution utilities because other private entities such as the cooperatives and private corporations mentioned enjoy similar privileges.\n\nIt is also worthy to point out that MORE is under a unique circumstance and is faced with an unusual obstacle. It is mandated to assume the operations of PECO, whose facilities are already existing and occupied by its employees, while simultaneously ensuring that the distribution of electricity to various areas in Iloilo City remain uninterrupted during the interim period. Though not impossible to accomplish, the Congress deemed it prudent to confer the power provided in Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 to guaranty that the transition phase will not hamper the duty of the franchisee to supply electric power, an essential necessity in the lives of people residing in Iloilo City. The Court, speaking through the ponencia of Associate Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr., explained that:\n\nMORE is a new franchise holder that is virtually deprived of the option to set up a new distribution system, not only because the existing public space is burdened with the distribution system of the old franchise holder, but also because it must hit the ground running and ensure the uninterrupted and continuous supply of electricity to the city. MORE is therefore peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise. [53]\n\nClearly, in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City who rely on the distribution system of PECO. There is no question that PECO's franchise was not renewed, thus, it can no longer operate the distribution system in Iloilo City. MORE, as the new franchisee, is mandated under Section 2 of R.A. No. 11212 to operate and maintain the distribution system in the best manner possible. To be able to do so, its right to expropriate the distribution system in Iloilo City to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity should not be hampered by unfounded allegations of undue benefit and corporate takeover. In the end, the net public benefit generated from the exercise of the right of eminent domain outweighs any and all incidental and secondary benefit any private entity, including MORE, may acquire. In view of the foregoing, the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 must be upheld.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPeralta, C.J., Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa, Gesmundo, Hernando, Rosario , and Lopez, JJ ., concur.\nLeonen and Lazaro-Javier, JJ ., dissent.

[1] Sections 10 [2] and 17 [3] of Republic Act No. 11212 are unconstitutional. They violate the equal protection clause, granting electricity franchise to a corporation strikingly inexperienced in supplying electricity. The provisions unduly discriminate against other public utilities, especially the former electric utility operating in Iloilo City, as well as those similarly situated to the new franchisee but, for reasons unclear, were not given the same concessions.\n\nWorse, the private property taken is not for public use. All that Sections 10 and 17 allow is a transfer of property from one private corporation to another for the same public purpose to which it was originally devoted. The inefficient monopolistic operation of the electric utility in Iloilo city remains, with no real improvement. In reality, the taking here only serves private interests, and whatever benefit the public gets is only incidental.\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration should therefore be granted and the Decision of the Mandaluyong trial court affirmed.\n\nI\n\nWhile broad and plenary, [4] as the majority states, the power of Congress to grant franchises for the operation of a public utility is always subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The foremost limitation is provided in Section 1 of the Bill of Rights: \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nIn my September 15, 2020 Dissent, I outlined how Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates the equal protection clause. The right of eminent domain delegated to More Electric Power Corporation (More Electric) constitutes class legislation\u2014a law that discriminates against some but favors others. [5] Reading Section 10 in isolation will not lead to this conclusion. However, when read in conjunction with the eminent domain provisions of other electricity franchises, the unwarranted benefits granted to More Electric becomes apparent.\n\nSection 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 provides:\n\nSECTION 10. Right of Eminent Domain . \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:\n\nProvided, further, That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nOn the other hand, the eminent domain provision in Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (Panay Electric) expired franchise states:\n\nSECTION 4. It is expressly provided that in the event the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself the system and enterprise herein authorized, the grantee shall surrender its franchise and will turn over to the government all equipment therein at fair market value.\n\nAs can be gleaned from the provisions, More Electric may exercise its delegated power of eminent domain over properties \"previously, currently or actually used . . . for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users\" in Iloilo City. These properties are no other than those used by the former electric utility, Panay Electric. Further, Section 10 allows More Electric to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric by mere payment of the full amount of their assessed value.\n\nThis is in contrast to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 5360, Panay Electric's expired franchise, which allows the government itself: not a mere delegate like More Electric, to exercise its power of eminent domain upon payment of fair market value. Assessed value being a mere percentage of the fair market value, [6] it is clear that Section 10 allows More Electric to exercise its delegated eminent domain powers by paying a significantly lower amount compared to what the government would have paid had it expropriated the properties of Panay Electric. This difference in the payable amount is a clear benefit to More Electric.\n\nThis difference is highlighted further by comparing Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 with the eminent domain provisions found in legislative franchises of other electric utilities.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nMore Electric and Power Corporation [Republic Act No. 11212 (2018)] | Mactan Electric Company, Inc.

No provisions similar to Section 17 can be found in the legislative franchises of other electric utilities.\n\nThese differences matter because More Electric has no experience in the business of supplying electricity. To be an allowable discrimination under the equal protection clause, the discrimination must, at the very least, be reasonable. [8] Indulging a corporation with all of these benefits, when it has no expertise in the business it seeks to operate, cannot be reasonable. This unreasonableness is more glaring considering that the supply of electricity is a business imbued with public interest.\n\nII\n\nMoreover, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution as it allows the taking of private property not for public use.\n\nThe definition of \"public use\" has evolved from the literal \"actual use by the public\" to \"public purpose,\" [9] \"'public advantage or benefit,\" [10] and \"public welfare.\" [11] Admittedly, the supply of electricity is one for public advantage and benefit.\n\nNevertheless, if property is taken for the same public use to which it was originally devoted, there is no true expropriation. As early as 1921, this Court in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government [12] noted how \"the meaning of the term 'public use' [is] one of constant growth\" [13] and that \"[a]s society advances, its demands upon the individual increase and e ach demand is a new use to which the resources of the individual may be devoted .\" [14] This implies that a true expropriation requires a new a public use.\n\nThus, if property is taken then subsequently devoted to the same public use, there is only a transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change as to who the profits. [15] Therefore, the taking primarily serves proprietary interests, with little to no regard to the interests of the public. Any public interest is only a pretense or incidental at best.\n\nMore Electric seeks to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric for the continued and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City. This is the exact same public use to which Panay Electric devoted its properties.\n\nIt must be emphasized that More Electric has no experience in electricity distribution and has no assets of its own to distribute electricity in Iloilo City . The electricity distribution system, even the workforce that would be operating the system, will be the same. All this case involves is a forced transfer of properties from Panay Electric to More Electric. The taking is not for public use but in the service of proprietary interests.\n\nThe majority concludes with this: \"in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City.\" [16] I cannot see this. All I see is a law giving a semblance of legitimacy to what actually is an abuse of the expropriation powers of the State.\n\nI therefore dissent.\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING , I vote to GRANT the Motion for Reconsideration and AFFIRM the July 1, 2019 Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 209, Mandaluyong City in Civil Case No. R\u00adMND-1900571.\n\n[1] Dissenting Opinion of J.

The attainted person is PECO.\n\nPECO is singled out . It is expressly identified as the wrongdoer . Upon it, legislative punishment as this was historically understood has been imposed. As well, the non-punitive legislative purpose has been far outweighed by the legislative intent to punish and the legislative punishment accordingly exacted . As clearly and succinctly recounted in the congressional deliberations , the non-punitive legislative purpose arose only from and was the result only of the punishment Sections 10 and 17 have envisioned to inflict.\n\nThe punishment is the legislative determination of what otherwise would have been a judicial function of the propriety of confiscating or expropriating PECO's properties resulting from the non-renewal of PECO's franchise and the propriety of allowing such confiscation or expropriation to favor the new franchise holder, MORE.\n\nSecond . Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection of the laws . They have been tailored to target and single out PECO and its properties. Sections 10 and 17 apply to no other entity but PECO and its facilities. Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010 [1] supports my claim. Third .

Essence of a bill of attainder\n\nBills of attainder have often been associated with criminal statutes. There is however no reason not to use the proscription against them to civil statutes that mirror what bills of attainder do in the criminal setting. Functionally and traditionally, bills of attainder as well as ex post facto laws have been invoked to nullify civil statutes or regulations. [2]\n\nThe essence of a bill of attainder is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of the legitimacy of a deprivation . The constitutional ban against bills of attainder serves to implement the principle of separation of powers by confining legislatures to rule-making and thereby forestalling legislative usurpation of the judicial function .\n\nHistory in perspective, bills of attainder were employed to suppress government takings of life or property involving unpopular causes and political minorities , and it is against this evil that the constitutional prohibition is directed. Thus:\n\nON reviewing the U.S. Constitution, it is easy to assume that the document contained no takings protection language prior to the addition of the Fifth Amendment , as part of the Bill of Rights. In reality, however, a takings protection was inserted directly into the body of the Constitution in 1787. This was the ban on bills of attainder , found in Article I, Sections 9 and 10. A bill of attainder is an egregious taking of life or property by an arbitrary legislative act, and the ban on bills of attainder was primarily meant to protect the people from such arbitrary takings by the government. During the antebellum period, construing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection was well known, and lawyers and judges frequently referred to this ban. It was only after the Civil War that this commonly understood takings protection faded gradually into disuse, primarily because of the Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation doctrine. Today, this protection is all but forgotten.\n\nRecognizing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection greatly aids in understanding several constitutional issues that have otherwise not been fully understood. For example, seeing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection helps in understanding why the Eleventh Amendment's passage was in large measure a reaction to potential attainder lawsuits against the states. We also better understand why the ban on ex post facto laws only needed to apply to criminal matters, and more clearly see how takings law/attainders were a driving force for separating governmental powers, particularly between the legislature and the judiciary . Finally, we can better understand why many of the founders - particularly James Madison - so greatly feared factions as the greatest threat to the new republic. In short, the ban on bills of attainder illuminates the early workings of the new constitutional republic in America.\n\nThis article mostly draws from the founders' comments at the Constitutional Convention and the antebellum case law that treats the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection. The jurists' and practitioners' statements in these early cases - including comments from such luminaries as John Marshall and Daniel Webster - demonstrate their understanding of the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection, independent of the Fifth Amendment or any other state takings language. Likewise, their statements about the ban on bills of attainder clarify the other constitutional doctrines discussed in this article.\n\nEven though the antebellum era has long since passed, the concept that the ban on bills of attainder is a takings protection and its clarification of other constitutional doctrines has value for us today. There is no compelling reason why the antebellum understanding of bills of attainder is any less legitimate now than back then. To be sure, the Fifth Amendment protections now apply to state takings due to the Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation doctrine. But this application in no way negates the ongoing potential effectiveness of using the ban on bills of attainder in the Constitution as a takings protection. Indeed, there will be times that the ban on bills of attainder will be a better fit for a particular judicial problem than the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Examples could include legislation targeting unpopular groups or groups holding property which the government wants. Accordingly, courts today should consider applying this provision of the Constitution as a takings protection, just as the courts formerly did. If they do, the courts will discover that it will not only serve to protect the innocent from arbitrary takings, but that it will also help clarify constitutional doctrines today as it did in former times. Indeed, this is one of the greatest benefits that can come from using the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection, since many constitutional doctrines today are often confused and misunderstood. [3]\n\nThe provision against bills of attainder came about in this historical factual context - the American revolutionary war needed funding and legislation provided that funding by taking the property of named persons as wrongdoers . [4] The drafters of the American Constitution were aware that these legislations were \"arbitrary and represented a dangerous power of government to take land , and wanted to ensure that such wholesale takings did not occur in the future. Hence, the Constitutional Convention adopted the ban on bills of attainder without dissent.\" [5]\n\nThe protection against bills of attainder primarily protected property rights , which had been greatly abused by such wartime enactments. [6] Individuals needed to be protected from egregious takings by the state \u2013 this protection was the ban on bills of attainder , which \"restricted all legislative takings failing to meet the standards of due process, compensation, and public use.\" [7] This protection was conceived to be a judicial one, a protection coming from the courts . [8]\n\nIn the United States of America, bills of attainder, including bills of pains and penalties, are constitutionally prohibited under Article I, Sections 9 and 10 of its Constitution .\n\nB. Elements of a Bill of Attainder\n\nThe elements of a bill of attainder are: (i) the singling out of a definite class, (ii) the imposition of a burden on it, without or far outweighing any non-punitive legislative purpose , and a legislative intent to do so , and (iii) the lack of judicial trial . [9] These elements stigmatize statute or any of its provisions as a bill of attainder .\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\ni. | Singling out of a definite class\n[END_TABLE]\n\ni. Singling out of a definite class\n\nIf the statute sets forth a generally applicable rule decreeing that any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics shall not enjoy a right or a privilege, and leaves to courts the task of deciding what persons have committed the specified acts or possessed the specified characteristics, the statute is valid .\n\nBut if the statute designates in no uncertain terms the persons who possess the feared characteristics and therefore cannot enjoy the right or privilege , for example, members of the Communist Party, or here, respondent PECO, the legislative act , no matter what its form , that applies either to named individuals or easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to deprive these individuals or groups of any right , civil or political, without judicial trial , is a bill of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nii. | Imposition of a burden, without or far outweighing any non-punitive legislative purpose, and a legislative intent to do so\n[END_TABLE]\n\nii. Imposition of a burden, without or far outweighing any non-punitive legislative purpose, and a legislative intent to do so\n\nIn Cummings v. Missouri , [10] the United States Supreme Court held that depriving or confiscating one's property has been understood historically as punishment .\n\nPresently, in the United States, there is no longer a requirement for the legislature to convict a person of a specified crime or to inflict the historical punishments of pain and/or death in order for a statute to constitute a bill of attainder. American law has never precluded the possibility that new burdens and deprivations might be legislatively fashioned that are inconsistent with the bill of attainder guarantee; there is as well no more need for the offending statute to include any formal legislative pronouncement of moral blameworthiness or formal intent to punish the targeted individual, group, or corporation . [11] The question is whether the legislation has a punitive objective or a legitimate, non-punitive, legislative purpose . Where such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear or are far out-weighed by an intention to cause deprivation , it is reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decision makers. [12]\n\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. Pataki [13] held that \"[w]here such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear,\" it is already \"reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decision makers,\" there are nonetheless several other tests set out in American jurisprudence for determining whether a statute is punitive or non-punitive . Therefore, if one follows American jurisprudence, one must also consider whether the provision could still be construed as amounting to a legislative determination of guilt and punishment.\n\nIn Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , a public utility wished to pass on the costs of a power outage to the consumers. A replacement generator had been purchased fifteen (15) years prior to the outage, but was not installed until the defective generator finally failed. A prior agreement was in place whereby Consolidated Edison could pass certain costs on to its ratepayers in the form of temporary rate increases subject to statutory review by the New York Public Service Commission. The Assembly and Senate, however passed a bill without amendment, thus:\n\n\u00a71. ...By continuing to operate steam generators known to be defective, and thereby increasing the risk of a radioactive release and/or an expensive plant outage, the Consolidated Edison Company failed to exercise reasonable care on behalf of the health, safety and economic interests of his customers. Therefore it would not be in the public interest for the company to recover from ratepayers any costs resulting from the February 15, 2000 outage at the Indian Point 2 Nuclear Facility.\n\nThe prohibition on recovering the cost extended to base rates \"or any other rate recovery mechanism.\"\n\nThe appellate court stated that an indispensable element of a bill of attainder is the fact that it defines past conduct as wrongdoing and then imposes punishment on that past conduct . The court considered three (3) factors in determining whether the statute was punitive :\n\n(1) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment ,\n\n(2) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed , it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes, and\n\n(3) whether it evinced an intent to punish .\n\nThe court focused on the last two (2) criteria, finding that eliminating harm to innocent third parties is a purpose consistent with punishment , and that general and specific deterrence are traditional justifications for punishment . The court determined that a quite substantial proportion of the costs in question could have been passed on unchallenged in a routine generator replacement. Nothing but punishment could justify preventing Consolidated Edison from passing these costs on to ratepayers. The court also found that the legislative history clearly evinced an intent to punish .\n\nConsolidated Edison is also remarkable in the clearly punitive intentions voiced by the legislators themselves and the inference which can be drawn from the language of the provision itself. Clearly, the court in that case was of the view that the legislature had concluded that the act of the public utility in failing to replace the generator was worthy of sanction , and viewed the legislation as imposing that sanction .\n\nUnited States v. Lovett , [14] concerned a provision which decreed that no salary or other compensation was to be paid to certain employees of the Government, specified by name , unless they were again appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The individuals in question allegedly had communist leanings. The court found that the purpose of the legislation was permanently to bar those individuals from government service because of what Congress thought about their political beliefs . The court further stated that the provision achieved the same purpose as would a statute which designated the conduct as criminal . The court, too, rejected the argument that the section did not provide for the dismissal of the individuals, but merely forbade governmental agencies to compensate them for any work.\n\nLovett is notable because the subjects of the provision were singled out from other government employees because of their political views , and were publicly blacklisted . There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the legislative intention was to punish the subjects for their beliefs and to make an example of them in order to deter others .\n\nIn the same vein, Acorn v. United States mentioned that the element of punishment involved the consideration of three (3) interdependent factors :\n\n(1) whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment ( historical test of punishment ); (2) whether the statute, \"viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed, reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes \" ( functional test of punishment ); and (3) whether the legislative record \"evinces a [legislative] intent to punish\" ( motivational test of punishment ). Selective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 852, 104 S.Ct. 3348. All three factors need not be satisfied to prove that a law constitutes \"punishment;\" rather, \"th[e] factors are the evidence that is weighed together in resolving a bill of attainder claim.\" Con. Edison, 292 F.3d at 350.\n\nAccording to Acorn , \"the Supreme Court has recognized that certain types of punishment are 'so disproportionately severe and so inappropriate to nonpunitive ends that they unquestionably have been held to fall within the proscription of the [Bill of Attainder Clause]'.\" Confiscation of one's property is one that has long been recognized as a type of punishment.\n\nThe functional test of punishment looks at the type and severity of the burdens imposed . Essentially, it answers the question , what will happen to the attainted entity, will it close shop and eventually be driven out of any business whatsoever and into bankruptcy? Thus:\n\n\"A grave imbalance or disproportion between the burden and the purported nonpunitive purpose suggests punitiveness, even where the statute bears some minimal relation to nonpunitive ends.\" Id.; accord Con. Edison, 292 F.3d at 350 (\"Where a statute establishing a punishment declares and imposes that punishment on an identifiable party ... we look beyond simply a rational relationship of the statute to a legitimate public purpose for less burdensome alternatives by which the legislature could have achieved its legitimate nonpunitive objectives .\"\n\nThe motivational test of punishment examines the intent of the legislators in enacting the statute - upon the legislature's determination that the attainted entity was guilty of abusive and fraudulent practices. This test looks for the declaration of guilt of the attainted entity by the legislature during its deliberations or in the statute itself and a congressional trial to determine such guilt . The standard of proof is clear legislative intent to punish .\n\nTo summarize, the test of punishment involves two (2) steps. First , identify if the legislation looks at past conduct as a wrongdoing . Second , determine if the legislation imposes burdens or deprivations on that past conduct . To complete the second step in the test, consider the three (3) factors in resolving whether the statute is punitive : (a) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment , (b) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed , it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes, and (c) whether it evinced an intent to punish .\n\nLastly, in Cummings v. Missouri , [15] it was held that a legislation is nonetheless a bill of attainder even if the persons or entities are singled out and punished only indirectly , that is, the punishment does not directly follow from the ascription of wrongdoing in the legislation. Thus:\n\nIf the clauses of the second article of the constitution of Missouri, to which we have referred, had in terms declared that Mr. Cummings was guilty , or should be held guilty, of having been in armed hostility to the United States, or of having entered that State to avoid being enrolled or drafted into the military service of the United States, and, therefore, should be deprived of the right to preach as a priest of the Catholic Church, or to teach in any institution of learning, there could be no question that the clauses would constitute a bill of attainder within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. If these clauses , instead of mentioning his name, had declared that all priests and clergymen within the State of Missouri were guilty of these acts, or should be held guilty of them, and hence be subjected to the like deprivation, the clauses would be equally open to objection . And, further, if these clauses had declared that all such priests and clergymen should be so held guilty, and be thus deprived, provided they did not , by a day designated, do certain specified acts, they would be no less within the inhibition of the Federal Constitution.\n\nIn all these cases there would be the legislative enactment creating the deprivation without any of the ordinary forms and guards provided for the security of the citizen in the administration of justice by the established tribunals.\n\nThe results which would follow from clauses of the character mentioned do follow from the clauses actually adopted. The difference between the last case supposed and the case actually presented is one of form only, and not of substance.\n\nThe existing clauses presume the guilt of the priests and clergymen, and adjudge the deprivation of their right to preach or teach unless the presumption be first removed by their expurgatory oath \u2013 in other words, they assume the guilt and adjudge the punishment conditionally . The clauses supposed differ only in that they declare the guilt instead of assuming it . The deprivation is effected with equal certainty in the one case as it would be in the other, but not with equal directness. The purpose of the lawmaker in the case supposed would be openly avowed; in the case existing it is only disguised. The legal result must be the same, for what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows. Its inhibition was levelled at the thing, not the name. It intended that the rights of the citizen should be secure against deprivation for past conduct by legislative enactment, under any form, however disguised . If the inhibition can be evaded by the form of the enactment, its insertion in the fundamental law was a vain and futile proceeding.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\niii. | Lack of judicial trial\n[END_TABLE]\n\niii. Lack of judicial trial\n\nTo illustrate, the proper procedure for the taking of private property and the improper manner of doing it have been spelled out , as follows:\n\nIf a legislature or state agency wants to take property, the proper procedure entails designating the property to be taken, filing a lawsuit identifying the property and its owners , and allowing the owners to contest the compensation that the legislature or state agency offers. This procedure essentially refers the consummation of the taking to the judiciary . This process happens all the time today and is relatively well understood. Other than the initial designation of land to be taken, the entire procedure takes place in the judicial branch .\n\nA bill of attainder seeks to bypass this procedure. It identifies the property to be taken , and then brazenly takes it , frequently with the excuse that the legislature is merely punishing an unworthy individual or group . No meaningful procedure is allowed for protest, and compensation is ignored. A structural check on legislative aggrandizement is the very heart and soul of the ban on bills of attainder and the essence of the separation of powers. As Justice Chase said in Calder v. Bull :\n\nThese acts [of attainder] were legislative judgments ; and an exercise of judicial power . . . The ground for the exercise of such legislative power was this, that the safety of the kingdom depended on the death, or other punishment, of the offender : as traitors, when discovered, could be so formidable, or the government so insecure! With very few exceptions, the advocates of such laws were stimulated by ambition, or personal resentment, and vindictive malice. To prevent such, and similar, acts of violence and injustice, I believe, the Federal and State Legislatures, were prohibited from passing any bill of attainder.\n\nJustice Chase's articulation corresponded with the understanding of his fellow jurists and practitioners during the antebellum period. Attorneys making arguments to the courts during this time often identified t he ban on bills of attainder as a legislative intrusion into the judicial sphere , and as a takings protection .\n\nC. Application of the Bill of Attainder test to Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212\n\nHere, we have exactly in the assailed provisions the objectionable bills of attainder.\n\nFirst, the language of Sections 10 and 17 and legislative history of RA 11212 single out PECO as a wrongdoer for the confiscation of its properties by MORE for the latter's take-over and immediate benefit and use, despite the availability of other means and properties for this purpose and bypassing existing regulations that address concerns about allegedly mismanaged organizations .\n\nSecond, through Sections 10 and 17 and its deliberations, Congress has already determined:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(i) | the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's propertiesbyMORE,\n(ii) | as wellas the propriety of MORE's take-overandimmediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(i) the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's properties by MORE, (ii) as well as the propriety of MORE's take-over and immediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n\nand thus, has made the judicial proceedings for expropriation by MORE against PECO a mere ceremonial procedure.\n\nThird, the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over and immediate benefit and use is the punishment for PECO's alleged wrongdoings , which in turn is a direct outcome of the non-renewal of its franchise and the award of the franchise to MORE .\n\nFourth, the non-punitive legislative purpose for the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over, benefit and use is far-outweighed by the legislative intent to deprive PECO of its properties.\n\nFor one , the public purpose for the confiscation arose solely from the utter inability of MORE as the new franchise holder to provide the facilities and technical knowhow to establish, operate, and maintain its franchise requirements .\n\nBut for this utter inability of MORE, there would have been NO non-punitive legislative purpose for the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over, benefit, and use . The non-punitive legislative purpose was a created or manufactured need when Congress allowed a non-equipped and ill-prepared entity to take-over the franchise and authorized a business plan that plainly revolved around the take-over of the existing franchise holder's properties.\n\nAs a result, it is reasonable to conclude that the punishment of PECO as the entity disadvantaged by RA 11212 is the legislation's only preponderant purpose. [16]\n\nEqually important , the condemnation of PECO's properties lock, stock, and barrel , is clearly overbroad in relation to the purported legitimate purpose of RA 11212 as it unnecessarily precludes PECO from using its properties for other business purposes.\n\nFifth , the congressional deliberations on the precursors of RA 11212 make it crystal clear that Sections 10 and 17 exhibit all the elements of a bill of attainder.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe language of Sections 10 and 17 and legislative history of RA 11212single out PECOas awrongdoerfor theconfiscationof its properties byMOREfor the latter'stake-overandimmediate benefit and use.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe language of Sections 10 and 17 and legislative history of RA 11212 single out PECO as a wrongdoer for the confiscation of its properties by MORE for the latter's take-over and immediate benefit and use.\n\nThe Explanatory Note for the precursor of RA 11212, House Bill No. 8132, identifies PECO as a wrongdoer in this manner:\n\nThe quality of service of PECO has been wanting . Among the complaints against PECO are: overbilling/overcharging, arrogant personnel/poor customer relations, distributor related outages, inadequately maintained lines, inadequate investment in distribution facilities, and inordinate delay in the restoration of power services, among others.\n\nSection 10 refers to the institution of expropriation proceedings and does not expressly identify PECO as the object of the confiscation. That PECO however is the object of Section 10 is clarified by Section 17 when it referred to PECO and its facilities. Besides, Section 10's reference to MORE's franchise area means no other than PECO and its properties.\n\nQuoted below extensively, the deliberations on RA 11212 make it clear as day that PECO's properties are the object of the legislated confiscation for MORE's take-over and immediate benefit and use .\n\nOf late, Senator William Gatchalian's statements have confirmed the singling out of franchise holders for the imposition of penalties against them for alleged past infractions . He was quoted to have said:\n\nIn fact, he said, any legislator could seek a review of Meralco's franchise as part of Congress' oversight authority even before the power distributor could apply for an extension.\n\n\"Based on our experience with ABS-CBN, the sins of the past can come and haunt you. In other words, during the deliberations of its franchise, this type of violation can be a basis for the revocation or non-extension of (Meralco's) franchise,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"This could be a 'bad record' against (Meralco) ... It could be a hindrance (for securing a new franchise),\" he cautioned. [17]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThrough Sections 10 and 17 and its deliberations, Congress hasalready determined:\n | \n(i) | the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's propertiesbyMORE,\n(ii) | as well asthe propriety of MORE's take-overandimmediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n | \nand thus, hasmade the judicial proceedings for expropriationby MORE against PECO amere ceremonial procedure.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThrough Sections 10 and 17 and its deliberations, Congress has already determined:\n\n(i) the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's properties by MORE, (ii) as well as the propriety of MORE's take-over and immediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n\nand thus, has made the judicial proceedings for expropriation by MORE against PECO a mere ceremonial procedure.\n\nThe texts of Sections 10 and 17, together with the deliberations on these provisions, have already decreed the presence of all the elements for the valid expropriation of PECO's properties .\n\nCongress has said that there is public use for the confiscation lock, stock and barrel of PECO's properties. The ponencia echoes this legislative determination. This contradicts the doctrine that the determination of whether a given use is a public use is a judicial function . [18]\n\nThis legislative determination disregards the crucial fact that the public use would NOT have come about, or would not have arisen or not have been created, but for the l egislatively endorsed business plan of MORE as the new franchise holder simply to take over PECO's properties as it did not have the facilities to establish, operate , and maintain its franchise.\n\nWould this type of public use legitimately fall within the rubric of public use for eminent domain purposes, when public use was brought about by bringing in a new franchise holder that can discharge the franchise only by taking over the assets of the immediately preceding franchise holder? The fact is that the courts have been boxed in and painted into a corner to acknowledge and affirm this type of public use because of the urgency to provide continuity in the provision of electricity to the people in the franchise area.\n\nSo far as the element of public use is concerned, the courts can no longer decide otherwise when Congress has resolved the presence of this element. The court proceedings for expropriation have become a fait accompli with the outcome already decided by legislative fiat .\n\nThe next element already resolved by Congress to exist is genuine public necessity . Section 10 expressly mentions that the taking of PECO's properties is actually necessary for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of MORE's franchise.\n\nSection 10 lists PECO's \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment ,\" as being actually necessary for the alleged public use the franchise is supposed to realize. Section 17 reinforces this determination of genuine public necessity when it mentions PECO and authorizes the expropriation of properties within the franchise area that are actually necessary for the franchise, namely, those mentioned in Section 10.\n\nSo did the congressional deliberations quoted below, which confirmed that the only way for MORE to establish, operate , and maintain its franchise is for it to take over PECO's properties .\n\nWhat is problematic about Section 10 and Section 17 is the preclusion of any debate on the genuine public necessity of expropriating PECO's \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment .\" Section 10 is categorical \u2013 it mentions the foregoing properties as examples of those properties that are \" actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted.\" Section 10 and Section 17 forestall a judicial determination as to the genuine public necessity for the taking of these properties.\n\nIn Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance , [19] the public necessity warranting the transfer of properties from one private owner to another private owner, as in the present case, must be nothing short of \" urgent cases , or cases of the first necessity .\" This type of condemnation cannot be likened \"to the case of personal property taken or used in time of war or famine, or other extreme necessity[, or] to the temporary possession of land itself, on a pressing public emergency, or the spur of the occasion. In the latter case there is no change of property.\" Hence, condemnation of one's property ought to be a remedy of last resort .\n\nDe la Paz Masikip v. The City of Pasig [20] explains that the requisite of genuine public necessity is defeated by the existence of properties and remedies other than or alternative to expropriation :\n\nIn this case, petitioner contends that respondent City of Pasig failed to establish a genuine necessity which justifies the condemnation of her property. While she does not dispute the intended public purpose, nonetheless, she insists that there must be a genuine necessity for the proposed use and purposes . According to petitioner, there is already an established sports development and recreational activity center at Rainforest Park in Pasig City, fully operational and being utilized by its residents , including those from Barangay Caniogan. Respondent does not dispute this. Evidently, there is no \"genuine necessity\" to justify the expropriation.\n\nThe right to take private property for public purposes necessarily originates from \"the necessity\" and the taking must be limited to such necessity. In City of Manila v. Chinese Community of Manila , we held that the very foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is a genuine necessity and that necessity must be of a public character. Moreover, the ascertainment of the necessity must precede or accompany and not follow, the taking of the land . In City of Manila v. Arellano Law College , we ruled that \" necessity within the rule that the particular property to be expropriated must be necessary , does not mean an absolute but only a reasonable or practical necessity, such as would combine the greatest benefit to the public with the least inconvenience and expense to the condemning party and the property owner consistent with such benefit.\"\n\nApplying this standard , we hold that respondent City of Pasig has failed to establish that there is a genuine necessity to expropriate petitioner's property. Our scrutiny of the records shows that the Certification issued by the Caniogan Barangay Council dated November 20, 1994, the basis for the passage of Ordinance No. 42 s. 1993 authorizing the expropriation, indicates that the intended beneficiary is the Melendres Compound Homeowners Association, a private, non-profit organization, not the residents of Caniogan. It can be gleaned that the members of the said Association are desirous of having their own private playground and recreational facility. Petitioner's lot is the nearest vacant space available. The purpose is, therefore, not clearly and categorically public. The necessity has not been shown, especially considering that there exists an alternative facility for sports development and community recreation in the area , which is the Rainforest Park, available to all residents of Pasig City, including those of Caniogan.\n\nThe right to own and possess property is one of the most cherished rights of men. It is so fundamental that it has been written into organic law of every nation where the rule of law prevails. Unless the requisite of genuine necessity for the expropriation of one's property is clearly established, it shall be the duty of the courts to protect the rights of individuals to their private property. Important as the power of eminent domain may be, the inviolable sanctity which the Constitution attaches to the property of the individual requires not only that the purpose for the taking of private property be specified. The genuine necessity for the taking, which must be of a public character, must also be shown to exist.\n\nSections 10 and 17 are all-encompassing in that they already a priori authorize the condemnation of \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment \" even during the transition period without any showing of a genuine public necessity in that there are no alternatives to taking them.\n\nPECO's situation is akin to those early cases that litigated the ban against bills of attainder :\n\nDaniel Webster was one of the most articulate critics in opposing legislative attempts to justify bills of attainder with the claim that whatever the legislature did satisfied due process or the law of the land . Webster gave his views on this issue in the cases involving Dartmouth College . Webster acted as counsel for the college in arguments before both the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1817 and on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819. As described in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward , the New Hampshire legislature passed a law that fundamentally altered the college's corporate form. It is significant that this was not a state college, but a wholly private one . The legislature expanded the number of trustees from 12 to 21, transferred college property to the new trustees , and authorized the treasurer to retain and hold college property against the will of the original trustees . Webster decried the legislation as unauthorized. He noted that in passing this bill, the legislature had targeted a single entity for improper treatment, passing sentence upon the college as if the legislature were a court promulgating a judgment . Webster alluded to Blackstone, noting that the New Hampshire acts \"have no relation to the community in general, and which are rather sentences than laws.\"\n\nIn response to New Hampshire's claim that its acts satisfied due process because the legislature created the law of the land, Webster noted:\n\nEverything which may pass under the form of an enactment, is not, therefore, to be considered the law of the land. If this were so, acts of attainder, bills of pains and penalties, acts of confiscation, acts reversing judgments, and acts directly transferring one man's estate to another, legislative judgments, decrees and forfeitures, in all possible forms, would be the law of the land. Such a strange construction would render constitutional provisions, of the highest importance, completely inoperative and void. It would tend directly to establish the union of all powers in the legislature.\n\nTherefore, when the legislature acts in a judicial capacity and passes a bill of attainder taking private property, and then seeks to proclaim itself above challenge in doing so, the legislature denies due process and engages in the most egregious of takings. The ban on bills of attainder was designed specifically to protect private property from such an eventuality. For Webster, New Hampshire's actions in respect to the college and the taking of its property constituted a due process/law of the land violation, and defied the separation of powers precisely because the legislature exceeded its authority and acted as a judicial body.\n\nThe 1838 Maryland case Regents of the University of Maryland v. Williams forcefully restated this point. In this case, the court decried state legislation whereby the university's property was taken and given to a new board of trustees , just as in Dartmouth College. The court commented on the legislature's improper intrusions on judicial power in these words:\n\nIf the transferring one person's property to another, by a special and particular act of the legislature, is a [sic] depriving him of his property, by or according to the law of the land, then any legislative judgment or decree, in any possible form, would be according to the law of the land, although there existed at the time no law of the land upon the subject, and that too by a tribunal possessing no judicial power, and to which all such power is denied by the constitution. Such a construction would tend to the union of all the powers of the government in the legislature, and to impart the attribute of omnipotency to that department, contrary to the genius and spirit of all our institutions; and the office of courts would be not to declare the law or to administer the justice of the country, but to execute legislative judgments and decrees, not authorized by the constitution. [21]\n\u2026.\n\nIn sum, the ban on bills of attainder is, in many ways, the quintessential declaration of the need for a separation of powers. If bills of attainder are allowed, then the legislature is supreme, and neither the judiciary nor any other body can question or set aside the legislature's acts. The ban on bills of attainder bridged the gap between the separation of powers embodied by the Constitution's framework and takings law as described in the Fifth Amendment. Bills of attainder are judicial acts by the legislature, in which the legislature defies takings law by taking property without following the proper method. A taking needs to be consummated in a certain way, and a bill of attainder is the wrong way. A legislature may not sit as a judicial body and declare whatever it does as satisfying due process or the law of the land. Hence, a proper understanding of the intent and scope of the ban on bills of attainder clarifies the separation of powers and increases an understanding of its true meaning as an unbreachable dividing line separating the reach of the different branches of government. [22]\n\nThere are existing alternatives for the properties already adjudged by RA 11212 as being \"actually necessary.\" To be sure, MORE can obtain buildings other than PECO's to establish and run its franchise. This is also true for PECO's poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, infrastructure, machineries and equipment . There is no conclusive showing of genuine public necessity to expropriate these items \u2013 yet Sections 10 and 17 have already determined that they are actually necessary for expropriation.\n\nAs MORE admitted during the Committee Hearings (see below for a more extensive treatment):\n\nWell, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market.\"\n\nMORE also acknowledged that it can allegedly build its facilities and operate the franchise in only a year's time : \"... since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right ... \"\n\nThis shows the lack of genuine public necessity for the taking, which Sections 10 and 17 have unfortunately already adjudged to be present to justify the condemnation.\n\nMere convenience for MORE is not what is required by law as the basis of genuine public necessity . Even in the face of necessity, if it can be satisfied without expropriation , the same should not be imposed. The convenience of the condemning party has never been the gauge for the exercise of eminent domain.\n\nThe true standard for genuine public necessity is adequacy . Hence, when there is already an existing adequate alternatives , as in this case, even when the alternatives, for one reason or another, be inconvenient, the need to expropriate is entirely unjustified .\n\nLastly, Section 10 has as well determined a presumptive amount for the just compensation to be paid by MORE to PECO.\n\nThe deliberations have also pegged an amount for just compensation (see below).\n\nCongress has to peg the amount of just compensation because this amount would be added to MORE's billings to its consumers as a means of reimbursing itself of such payment, and therefore, would ultimately impact on MORE's viability as a franchise.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nReducing the judicial expropriation proceedings to a mere ceremonial function\n[END_TABLE]\n\nReducing the judicial expropriation proceedings to a mere ceremonial function\n\nWhat is clear from both the language of Sections 10 and 17 and the legislative intent as expressed during the Committee Hearings is the singling out of PECO and the determination by legislative fiat of the presence of all the elements to validate the taking of its properties.\n\nRA 11212 has resolved the elements of public use and genuine public necessity, and the presumptive quantum of just compensation. Thus, the statute has rendered any court proceeding on expropriation to be merely ceremonial.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThelegislative confiscationof PECO's properties forMORE's take-overandimmediate benefit and useis thepunishmentfor PECO's alleged wrongdoings, which in turnis adirect outcomeof the non-renewal of its franchise and the award of the franchise to MORE.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over and immediate benefit and use is the punishment for PECO's alleged wrongdoings , which in turn is a direct outcome of the non-renewal of its franchise and the award of the franchise to MORE .\n\nTo stress, the element of punishment in the bill of attainder test does not mean that the legislature has to convict a person of a specified crime or to exact punishments of pain or death.\n\nBurdens and deprivations upon targeted persons or entities, without any formal legislative pronouncement of moral blameworthiness or formal intent to punish, may constitute punishment depending on this test \u2013 whether the legislation has a punitive objective or a Legitimate non-punitive legislative purpose .\n\nWhere the legitimate legislative purpose is non-existent or is far out-weighed by an intention to cause deprivation , it is reasonable to conclude , that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the legislators.\n\nAs stated, the test involves two (2) steps. First, identify if the legislation looks at past conduct as a wrongdoing . Second, determine if the legislation imposes burdens or deprivations upon that past conduct . To complete the second step in the test, consider the three (3) factors in resolving whether the statute is punitive :\n\n(1) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment (historical test),\n\n(2) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed , it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes (functional test), and\n\n(3) whether it evinced an intent to punish (motivational test).\n\nHere, Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 originated from the alleged wrongdoings of PECO as a franchise holder. Upon this alleged past misconduct , burdens and deprivations are imposed: the non-renewal of PECO's franchise, the award of the franchise to MORE , and the latter's take-over of PECO's properties through expropriation whose propriety Congress has already determined through the assailed provisions.\n\nThis fulfils the first step of the test .\n\nAs regards the secon d step , I first focus on the historical meaning of legislative punishment or the historical test of punishment . According to the congressional deliberations quoted below, the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties has been decreed to eliminate harm to innocent third parties and to the viability of MORE as the new franchise holder , i.e., the continuous supply of electricity to consumers by MORE . It may also be reasonably presumed that Congress wants to send a message via the legislated condemnation of properties to franchise holders to shape up or ship out, i.e ., general and specific deterrence . Together with the protection of people and communities, deterrence is the traditional and historical justification for punishment .\n\nAs borne by the congressional deliberations (see below), routine expropriation clauses in franchise grants do not function as the principal and primary backbone for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of a franchise. This type of clause does not settle the propriety of expropriation and allows courts to determine the propriety of expropriation. But routine expropriation clauses are unlike Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 where Congress has already put the bind on courts to complete the expropriation of PECO's properties to ensure the supply of electricity in the franchise area. Nothing but punishment justifies the compulsion and urgency to expropriate PECO's properties.\n\nI will also quote Senator William Gatchalian's statements which confirm the claim that PECO has been punished not only through the non-renewal of its franchise (which Congress admittedly has the constitutional authority) but also through the expropriation of PECO's properties via Sections 10 and 17. The Honorable Senator is quoted to have said:\n\nAs of March, Meralco had 6.4 million residential accounts, or 92 percent of the total in its franchise area in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. Commercial customers accounted for 530,864 (8 percent) connections and industrial customers, 10,580 (0.2 percent).\n\n\"I'm pleased with the swift resolution (of the ERC) to impose a fine ... But the penalty of P19 million, for me, is just a drop in the bucket for Meralco,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"I think the almost P300 million in penalty is reasonable enough because their violation is nonconformity to the orders of the ERC,\" the senator said.\n\n\"If they still resist, I will advise ERC to mete out heftier fines and find other ways to penalize (Meralco),\"he said in a separate radio interview.\n\nNo breakdown of charges\n\nGatchalian assailed Meralco and other power distributors for their continued failure to clearly explain to their customers the breakdown of monthly charges, such as the collection of environmental fee and feed-in-tariff allowance and a universal tax on all electric consumers.\n\nHe said the recent decision of the House of Representatives to deny ABS-CBN's application for a new franchise should be a lesson to all holders of legislative licenses.\n\nIn fact, he said, any legislator could seek a review of Meralco's franchise as part of Congress' oversight authority even before the power distributor could apply for an extension.\n\n\"Based on our experience with ABS-CBN, the sins of the past can come and haunt you. In other words, during the deliberations of its franchise, this type of violation can be a basis for the revocation or non-extension of (Meralco's) franchise,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"This could be a 'bad record' against (Meralco) ... It could be a hindrance (for securing a new franchise),\" he cautioned.

The latter refers to the uninterrupted provision and distribution of electricity to consumers in the franchise area .\n\nLess burdensome alternatives , however, could have been resorted to by Congress to achieve this non-punitive objective. For one, it could have required the winning franchisee to be ready with its own facilities ; for another, it could have left the determination of the propriety of expropriation to the courts, without having to determine by itself that expropriation is the key to MORE's assumption as franchise-holder and that all the elements of expropriation are already present vis-\u00e0-vis PECO's properties.\n\nIndeed, while I acknowledge that Congress has a legitimate interest in ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity in the franchise area \u2013\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(i) | thespecificity of the affected party\u2013 PECO,\n | \n(ii) | theuniqueness of the congressional action\u2013 asadmitted by the Energy Regulatory Commissionduring the congressional deliberations (see below), and\n | \n(iii) | thebreadth of the restrictive actionin this case \u2013the wholesale condemnation of PECO's properties, since theseproperties are its only properties and will result in its bankruptcyas abusiness entityregardless of the nature of its subsequent business or businessesPECO engages in,\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(i) the specificity of the affected party \u2013 PECO, (ii) the uniqueness of the congressional action \u2013 as admitted by the Energy Regulatory Commission during the congressional deliberations (see below), and (iii) the breadth of the restrictive action in this case \u2013 the wholesale condemnation of PECO's properties , since these properties are its only properties and will result in its bankruptcy as a business entity regardless of the nature of its subsequent business or businesses PECO engages in,\n\nall these render Sections 10 and 17 disproportionately severe and thus punitive under the functional test of punishment .\n\nWorse, the public use and necessity for the confiscation of PECO\u2019s properties arose solely from the utter inability of MORE as the new franchise holder to provide the facilities and technical knowhow to establish, operate, and maintain its franchise requirements. But for this utter inability of MORE , there would have been NO non-punitive legislative purpose for the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over, benefit, and use. The non-punitive legislative purpose was a created or manufactured need when Congress allowed a non-equipped and ill-prepared entity to take-over the franchise and authorized a business plan that plainly revolved around the take-over of the existing franchise holder's properties.\n\nThus , it is reasonable to conclude that the punishment of PECO as the entity disadvantaged by RA 11212 is the legislation's only preponderant purpose .\n\nEqually troublesome, the condemnation of PECO's properties lock, stock, and barrel, is clearly overbroad in relation to the purported legitimate purpose of RA 11212. This legislated approach unnecessarily precludes PECO from dedicating and using its properties for business purposes other than the distribution of electricity in the franchise area.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThecongressional deliberationson the precursors of RA 11212make it crystal clearthatSections 10and17 exhibit all the elementsof abill of attainder.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe congressional deliberations on the precursors of RA 11212 make it crystal clear that Sections 10 and 17 exhibit all the elements of a bill of attainder.\n\nThe legislative intent to punish or the motivational test of punishment unearths Sections 10 and 17 as products of congressional deliberations which show the intent to single out PECO, adjudge it as guilty of wrongdoings , and confiscate its properties for MORE's convenient takeover .\n\nThe congressional deliberations revolved around MORE's business plan to take over the operations and properties of PECO \u2013 simply because MORE has none of the facilities AND personnel to establish, operate and maintain its franchise .

UYBARRETA You mentioned earlier iyong reduction of rates, iyong customer service, iyong upgrading of customer satisfaction, iyong pagbabawas natin ng brownout and instances. Well, these are all good for the consumers and gusto rin namin iyon. But here in our... the Committee, we would like to be assured that the... ultimately the customers of Iloilo City hindi mapre-prejudice. Iyon naman lang po gusto namin dito.\n\nWe are one with you as far as that aspect is concerned. Kasi mahirap na... alam mo po pag pinag-uusapan natin ang mahal na kuryente, madali tayong umangal. But ang hindi natin nare-realize ang pinakamahal na kuryente ay iyong walang kuryente. And we're talking about inflation here, mahal ang gastusin sa bigas, marami ang nagugutom. Pero pag dineprayb(deprive) ninyo iyong mga kababayan natin from Iloilo na mapanood iyong Probinsiyano, patay tayong lahat diyan. That's the reason why we're trying to help you achieve your goals also. So, you mentioned wala kayong infrastructure right now. Wala kayong substation, wala kayong linya currently, and you intend to take... to supply them by year 2017... ah, 2019. Doon lang po ako may worry na ano. Kasi, well, you can contract although until such time that your amendments are approved the Securities and Exchange Commission, then you can contract with suppliers. But again iyong goal ninyo is to distribute and by distribution you need all these infrastructures and facilities. You need the substation na pagdadalahan n'yo, para icascade ninyo, ibaba ninyo, you need the 69 KB lines. You need secondary and collateral lines. You need all the transformers to bring it down to the consumers. Kaya sabi ko nga po sa inyo eh mahirap tayong hindi natin mabigyan iyong Iloilo ng kuryente. So, can you just enlighten this Representation and also this Committee on the exact plan as far as MORE Corporation is concerned?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor. Thank you for that comment, Your Honor. Yeah. Again, our base case, I would say, is the... if the franchise of PECO will end and we may have... well, we will be granted the franchise, 'no, is, well, we will take over the assets of PECO, 'no. And, well, these are... Your Honor, that's correct that, well, depriving consumers of power, \u2018no, is\u2026 well, our primary\u2026 well, is not\u2026 well, may not be good. It's not really good. But what we have in mind, Your Honor, is that in the long term, 'no, when... if we are able because we are confident that we will be able to bring down the rates, 'no. I mean, given the basket of suppliers that they have now as was flashed earlier, they are not taking advantage. Or the consumers are not even taking advantage of the low power that is being provided by the... that is available in the open market, 'no.

Your Honor, the customer profile ... well, Iloilo ... well, the franchise area is about 66,000 customers. And from the official records that we have seen that are publicly available, there is only one big customer, all the rest. .. well, I would distributed between residential, commercial establishments, government offices, 'yun. So, it's a... well, definitely there are commercial, especially recently when Megawide or Megaworld, Ayala and all the others started to put up the malls the last two... well, three to four The... well, rather, the customer profile has already... well, for commercial has already increased but in terms of industrial, I would say it is on the low side, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. And these malls that you mentioned, are they sourcing their power sa current franchise holder or are they directly connected?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor. They are sourcing their power from the current franchise holder , Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. So it is, more or less, safe to presume that the bulk of the revenue comes from these three malls that you mentioned?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Well, if we lump the commercial establishments together vis-a-vis the whole customer profile, well, I would say that, yes. I mean, it's a significant contribution coming from the commercial... what you call this, commercial portion, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Given the franchise area that you are applying for and the customer mix and profile, in your estimate, how many substation do you need? Kasi part of the problem as far as outages are concerned is the lack of substation, so I think it's within your CapEx plan, so how many do you ...\n\nMR. CASTRO. Your Honor, well, per our technical, the existing five actually are sufficient for now.

UYBARRETA. Mr. Chair, over and above what they presented today and the business plan, can we also get from them a more technical report and plan regarding how they intend to distribute electricity to the franchise area that they are applying for. Kasi ganito lang po iyan, at the end of the day, we are answerable to the consumers of the franchise area that you are applying for, while they are saying that it's hard to reinvent the wheel, pero alam naman po natin and meron palang existing franchise ngayon doon and why fix something that is not broken. That's just my concern. But I also advance the concept that we... the customer is the boss. Ultimately, kung anong ikabubuti ng consumer, doon tayo and part of our oversight function here is to safeguard the interest of the consumers. We are... I am asking hard questions because, ultimately, si Chairman ko ang sisisihin kung sakaling maano tayo. So, Mr. Chair, if I may just be allowed a few more question, just for my satisfaction?

Your Honor, well, based on the ...\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Kasi currently sila ang may-ari, hindi ba, Boss?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA.

Ang problema lang kung ... eh, paano kung hindi ibenta sa inyo?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Mr. Chair, Your Honor. Well, based on the financial statements that we've seen of PECO, the hard assets or... yeah, the hard assets out of that about three billion of total assets, the hard assets that's directly related to the business is about 460 or 480 million pesos.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Four hundred sixty?\n\nMR. CASTRO. If I'm not mistaken it's in the region of 460 to 480 million pesos, Your Honor. So, well, if there will be an offer, then, definitely, we can ... well, we will buy the assets and to the extent that we think would be justifiable. Because at the end of the day, well, whatever the price is, is a price to certain extent that would be reflected into the bills of the consumers, anyway.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Yes. That's where I'm getting to.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Kasi ang promise ninyo kanina is to lower the rates.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA.

Definitely, we will ... what do you call this, we will have to agree on what that price is because as I was mentioning earlier, Your Honor, well, if it's priced too much and it will be reflected in the rates, anyway, and it wouldn't help in bringing down the rates for the consumers, then we may have to opt for other... other option which is maybe through ... well, if we put up our own ...\n\nREP.

Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to ask this question sa ERC. Sabi ni Cong. Caloy na ang nagiging problema, what happens in a scenario wherein one has the franchise and the other one has the asset, anong magiging remedy ng ERC diyan? Anong ruling ninyo diyan? Paano ninyo didiskartehan iyan?\n\nMR MAATUBANG. ML Chair, Your Honor, actually, we have submitted that in our position paper, Your Honor, and already discussed that during the previous hearing, Your Honor, that in the event that there are two DUs in one geographical location, there will be economies of scale, that problem. So, in the end, there will be a problem with the consumers. And in terms of assets, Your Honor, that's the problem, the other one has no assets on how it will be delivered their electricity and the other one has the assets.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. In the event that only one will be given the franchise, ang isang assumption mo riyan sa statement mo, dalawa sila.\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. Yes, Sir.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Ngayon, kung isa paano?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. That's the problem, Your Honor. So that will be a problem in terms of regulation, in terms of prices because there will be economies of scales in terms of rate regulations, Your Honor. And at the same time, the one with no asset, Your Honor, basically they will ... there's the option to tap the other one for the billing of the service which is being done right now, like for the sales in our electric cooperatives. That would also be a scenario, Your Honor.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. So iyong mga... ang precedence niyan will be the winning franchise holder will have to negotiate with the one with the asset and acquire. Ganyan ang mangyayari diyan. Iyong. mga cooperatives na sinasabi mo kapag, may nananalong iba, siya ang bumibili nung asset nung natalo. Tama ba iyon? Iyon ba ang precedence niyon?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. No, Your Honor. I am just only saying that in case there are two DUs, then one DU that has no assets, has to.,. has an option to wheel its power to the other one. So they will have to rent the distribution utility to deliver its power to its customers , Your Honor.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. Mr. Chair, can we ask that is allowable by law, what you are saying?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. Yes, right now it's open access, Your Honor. That is allowed, Your Honor.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. You know, when we award a franchise, only Congress has the power to take it back because you cannot rise above sa source. Kung ang sinabi namin ikaw ang franchise holder, you cannot sublease your franchise and give it to somebody else without informing Congress because that's not transferable. So I don't think that is allowed. Your opinion, I think, is not really happening na ang prangkisa ha, prangkisa that emanates from Congress is being transferred to a different entity without the knowledge of Congress or permission from Congress.\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. No, Your Honor, what I am saying is that in terms of access of electricity. For example, if an end-user wants to get power from other sources other than the DU, they can wheel that power to the host DU.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. Mr. Chair, I think ERC has an attorney here, their legal. So maybe the question of Congressman Tambunting is better answered by Attorney Arjay.\n\nMR. ARJAY LOUIE B. CUANAN (Attorney III, Energy Regulatory Commission). Yes, good morning, Mr. Chair. Good morning to the Members of the Committee. Actually, the question is if there is a precedent already, if the legislative franchise has been transferred or subleased to other cooperatives. Is that right?\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Yes.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. Is that allowable by law and is there a precedent already that happened before, for the appreciation of the Committee?\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n5. | Theforced condemnation by legislation ofPECO's properties toserve the business interests of MOREas the new franchisee isunprecedentedand thefirst of its kindin franchise law-making and regulation.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n5. The forced condemnation by legislation of PECO's properties to serve the business interests of MORE as the new franchisee is unprecedented and the first of its kind in franchise law-making and regulation .\n\nMR. CUANAN. Yes. Regarding the first question, Your Honor, the law explicitly provides that it is not allowed to transfer or to lease the legislative franchise that has been granted by, Congress, without the permission or without the consent of the Congress itself, their granting power.\n\nWith respect to the second question, we actually don't have the idea yet if there is ... if the said subleasing of legislative franchise has been happening because as what we've said, this is not... this is prohibited by law.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. So can we go back to the first question which is, what happens if one has the franchise and the person, the incumbent whose franchise will lapse and has the assets but with no franchise, so one has the permission, the permit but the other one has the asset. What is now...how would ERC rule on this?\n\nMR. CUANAN. Actually, Your Honor, as we speak today, we have not ruled on that particular, we have not encountered such particular issue so far, where there is a franchise holder and the other one has the asset. So probably, the existing franchise holder will take over or will buyout the assets of the old franchise holder.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. So, if they will take over, through a corporate takeover, then hindi na ho nila kailangan humarap ngayong umaga dito, So they will take over the company...\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. (Continuing) \u2026 the company if they want to, the corporate entity if they wanna take over the assets only without the corporate entity. And the corporate itself, the PECO, already has a franchise eh. So, why are you applying a new franchise here, if that's your intention, ha? We're just trying to understand.\n\nMR. CUANAN. Sorry, Your Honor. I think PECO has a separate juridical entity. If they want to maintain, I mean they want to have a juridical... separate juridical personality from PECO, the existing franchise holder, so they need to secure a franchise.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. So, hindi na ho applicable iyong sinagest(suggest) ni Engineer Maatubang and the question of the Honorable Tambunting about Company A who has the asset and Company B... but losing, 'no, and Company B who has the liquidity but wants to take over the asset . So, that's what we're trying to connect here and if that is allowable also by law, kayong ERC ang makakasagot diyan.\n\nMR. CUANAN. Okay. For that, Your Honor, MORE Corporation has to secure legislative franchise. And if they will be given that franchise or granted that franchise then, probably, they can secure or buyout the assets of PECO, which is the existing franchise holder, if in case PECO will ... PECO's franchise will not be renewed. Okay, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. So, the asset only, not including the franchise. What if PECO's franchise was renewed?\n\nMR. CUANAN. Actually, we have not encountered that, Your Honor. We have no precedent on that because... we have actually one which is Bicol Light which is already ... which is still pending before the Senate. But we have not encountered a situation where there are two distribution utilities within the geographical area.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON. Okay, before that, the Chair would like to recognize Congressman Montoro.\n\nI have just one additional question. Iyong pinaka... from what I understand iyong pinaka-question kasi, paano iyong transition period, for example nga sa scenario na ma-approve ang MORE? And then, let's say, hindi ma-renew kaagad iyong PECO since January mag-e-expire na, sino'ng magsu-supply ng kuryente, habang iyong MORE o iyong period na iyon na mag-expire ang PECO? Ano iyong MORE kunwari magse-set up pa nu'ng kanilang infra ng equipment, siyempre mag..medyo may kakailanganin na time iyon eh especially if hindi naman bibilhin iyong assets na existing. So, sino'ng magsu-supply sa Panay? Like, iyong ERC ba nagbibigay ba kayo ng provisional authority na mag-operate muna sila until such time na ready na iyong MORE? Or, papaano ang magiging set-up? Hindi naman puwedeng mag-brownout iyong Panay.\n\nREP. TEODORO G. MONTORO. Mr. Chair, can I?\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. I think... yes. So, is it. .. Attorney, I think the... to amend, 'no, the question really is, what if there is a standoff and they don't want to sale to the winning bidder? What... how would you rule? Would you give a PA to them pending the approval, the sale?\n\nMR. CUANAN. Sir, may I just hand over the floor to Engineer Maatubang?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. Your Honor, if that is the case, Your Honor, there will be a problem in regulations in terms of how we will regulate the two distribution utilities, That's the... that's what our concern here that was submitted in this Honorable Commission.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. I think very specific naman po iyong tanong. Iyong tanong is kung hindi sila magka\". alam nating magkakaproblema kaya nga ho kami nagtatanong sa inyo, 'no. Alam namin may problema. Ngayon, ano hong magiging solusyon ho n'yo? Ano'ng magiging ruling n'yo diyan? Magbibigay ba kayo ng provisional permit? \"O, sige, tuloy ka muna, PECO, habang nagtatayo iyong nanalong\", winning franchise owner:'\n\nMR. CUANAN. Sir, since we don't encounter yet this particular issue, can we refer this yet to the Committee, if ever, I mean, to the Commission, ever? Give us an opportunity to confer the matter to the Commission. Because our existing policy is we grant Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessit... Necessity and Convenience to the distribution utility and that is based on the legi... or dependent on the legislative franchise being granted by the Congress. So, if the franchise is denied, so immediately ipso facto the CPCN is also denied.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Correct.\n\u2026.\n\nMr. Chair, we are walking on very thin ice here, sabi nga ng ERC, this is the very first time that this is happening . Kasi nga po, ang distribution and transmission business is a natural monopoly, accepted po iyan in any country and all over the world that distribution and transmission is a natural monopoly kasi po sa laki ng gastos para mag set up ng facilities. I heard that MORE committed that they will be able to put up their facilities, their complete distribution facilities within one year, I don't want to debunk that or ano, I just wish them well. But we know for a fact that just to set up one substation entails a lot of years and months, that's just one substation. And during last hearing, it was stated that for one distribution utilities to be able to supply the need of the franchise area that we are referring to or we are discussing here, a minimum of five substations will be required. That is capital intensive. We are not even talking about the distribution lines. We are not even talking about 'yung mga capacitor, 'yung mga transformers, the meters, the new meters, the new lines that will be put in. Again, kaya I just appeal for us to be very, very careful in deciding this. I will go for any move to give better service to any given consumers. I'm all for that. But I'm also on the side of caution kasi nga ano eh, I have nothing against MORE , if they can promise better service, I'm all for that kasi at the end of the day, we are all here for the welfare of the consumers. But I just caution that kasi hindi natin napag-uusapan 'yung aspeto na 'yon that the signal that we will be ending to the lending institution and to the investors, kung ano man ang gagawin natin dito, will have repercussion on that.

Do they know na nag-submit kayo?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Mr. Chair, Your Honor, well, we have not yet, well, gone formally to PECO regarding this, Your Honor.\n\nREP. MONTORO. Exactly, Mr. Chair, magkakaroon tayo ng problema rito later on kasi wala pa silang communication or formal communication with that current holder. So, siguro in the meantime, I move for deferment muna dahil kailangan munang... we have to... for the next meeting, I move that the holder will be present here para magkaroon tayo ng ano. Baka magkaroon tayo ng problema later on. Mag-aano tayo tapos sila pa ang may hawak. [25]\n\nx x x x\n\nREP. UNABIA. So, Mr. Chair, I understand the franchise of PECO will expire on January, 2019? Can I ask MORE Minerals Corporation, if ever, Mr. Chair, if ever they will be granted a franchise, 'no, how long can you put up your, for example, DU or distribution to Iloilo, if ever?\n. . . .\nMR. ROEL Z. CASTRO (President, MORE Minerals Corporation). Good morning, Honorable Committee and Honorable Chair. To the question of the Honorable Unabia, if we were to put up our own system I think it would take about a year, more or less. But, again, I mean, we are still looking at the ... at the mode wherein we could ...we could take over the assets, of course, with just compensation to the existing franchise holder, Mr. Chair. Thank you.\n. . . .\nREP. PANCHO. Ilang years po? Kasi ang sabi po nila ay it will take them at least a year to construct iyong mga bagong mga infrastructure nila. So, ilan po ang nakikita ninyo na ideal number of years na kailangan nating ibigay para doon sa winding period?\n\nMS. GINES. Your Honors, ang isa pong alternative to them putting up is to, iyon na nga po, take over the current facilities but subject to the payment of just compensation. Kasi mayroon din naman pong portion of the cost of those facilities na equity ng PECO and then you also have the obligations. So, iyon po iyong isang alternative para ho dire-diretso iyong service pong kuryente. Pero iyon na nga po ang sinabi ko ho kanina, strictly speaking po. Kaya po sabi ko po kanina, strictly speaking, iyon po talaga iyong legal implication without a franchise. But I don't think na pagdating po ng alas onse... 11:59 ng gabi, eh, talagang magsha-shutoff. Hindi naman po. Hindi naman po siguro ganoon ang mangyayari.\n\n\u2026.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Just, actually, I will not be asking too much question already because except for the fact that I requested for a technical report which I got this morning. However, just to.. for us as the Committee on Franchise, to have a wider perspective of what we are doing right now. Iyong sinabi kanina that both DUs will be operating at a loss, in layman's term, ang sinasabi doon is pahabaan ng pisi, kung sino 'yung makakatagal na lugi magpatakbo ng negosyo at mag-survive, iyon 'yung matitira. Mr. Chair, that's a very dangerous business practice. Mahirap po if we are enticing investors to come in in our country at sasabihin natin, \"Pahabaan kayo ng pisi, eh anyway parehas kayong lugi eh.\" That's a very dangerous business concept for us. Now, just so that we will have a bigger picture also. I'm pretty sure because of my experience sa DUs and the electric cooperatives, I'm pretty sure that the existing franchise has existing loans, one hundred percent ako sure diyan, one hundred and ten percent sure ako diyan, they have existing loans because most of the time, when you upgrade or even repair your facilities, you take in loan and then you apply that sa capex application, ina-apply sa ERC and then the ERC would give them the proper rate and a time frame or a time table to recover. Naka-apply po. Now, assuming this thing will happen, ang bigger question natin is, ano ang mangyayari sa existing loans ng existing franchise holder? Are we giving a very bad signal to the investors and to the lending institutions that we have?\n\nMr. Chair, we are walking on very thin ice here, sabi nga ng ERC, t his is the very first time that this is happening . Kasi nga po, ang distribution and transmission business is a natural monopoly, accepted po iyan in any country and all over the world that distribution and transmission is a natural monopoly kasi po sa laki ng gastos para mag set up ng facilities. I heard that MORE committed that they will be able to put up their facilities, their complete distribution facilities within one year, I don't want to debunk that or ano, I just wish them well. But we know for a fact that just to set up one substation entails a lot of years and months, that's just one substation. And during last hearing, it was stated that for one distribution utilities to be able to supply the need of the franchise area that we are referring to or we are discussing here, a minimum of five substations will be required. That is capital intensive. We are not even talking about the distribution lines. We are not even talking about 'yung mga capacitor, 'yung mga transformers, the meters, the new meters, the new lines that will be put in. Again, kaya I just appeal for us to be very, very careful in deciding this. I will go for any move to give better service to any given consumers. I'm all for that. But I'm also on the side of caution kasi nga ano eh, I have nothing against MORE , if they can promise better service, I'm all for that kasi at the end of the day, we are all here for the welfare of the consumers. But I just caution that kasi hindi natin napag-uusapan 'yung aspeto na 'yon that the signal that we will be ending to the lending institution and to the investors, kung ano man ang gagawin natin dito, will have repercussion on that. That's just my manifestation, Mr. Chair.\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. OFALSA. (Continuing)...EPIRA po, RA 9136, may third party valuation po na isa\u00ad submit on the valuation of the assets. But for now po, when a... sa existing policy ng ERC in existing distribution utilities, we have guidelines using a standard on how we value the assets po.

TAMBUNTING. Mr. Chair, may I ask the More representatives? Do you agree with the formula presented by ERC?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Your Honors, yes, we agree with the formula. Now, however, still I think... well, when it comes... because there has been no experience on private company take over and... well, and let me just say that. ..just going back to that question... to the answer earlier that there has to be just compensation and I think this is related to that, Mr. Chair. The question is if, let's say, the asking price of the... well, of the existing asset owner is too high that would jeopardize the rate, ano, to the end consumer, still I think... well, an approach might not be totally acceptable because, at the end of the day, it's gonna be the consumers who will take it. So, that's why I think there has to be a deeper study on who actually owns really the assets, I mean, upon take over. Because as you correctly pointed out, part of it has already been recovered. In fact, if.. well, from the distribution assets right now, if, let's say, there are assets that are fully recovered which means that consumers have already paid for it over a period of time, the question is does it still ... make sure that it's still owned by PECO wherein...\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Correct.\n\nMR. CASTRO.... well, a company like us who would be negotiating for just compensation be included in the asset-based. [26]\n\nx x x x\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Thank you very much, Atty. Jan. For the transition plan which has been submitted to the ComSec, maybe we can ask Mr. Roel Castro to expound on this, with the permission of the Chair.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON. Mr. Castro, do you have a presentation or...\n\nMR. ROEL Z. CASTRO (President, MORE Electric and Power Corporation). Good morning, Your Honors. Yes, we have a short presentation on the transition plan.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Please proceed.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Next, please. So, upon granting of franchise, Monte Oro Power will negotiate with PECO for the purchase of its distribution assets. Assuming that there is... that it is positive then we will apply for the certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and we will deploy technical personnel to conduct the operations improvement plan; develop the planning and control processes for operations and maintenance; deploy security; and conduct a total system and network audit. Should the negotiation be successful, as stated during the last hearing, we are... actually we are open and we would like to hire the existing personnel of PECO; develop a total distribution network development plan; implement the processes to determine the cost-effective capital investments, establish maintenance program; create the corporate planning group to establish and optimize management processes. Now, if there is a failure to reach an agreement, which means that PECO and MORE Power cannot... well, has no agreement on terms, MORE Power will file an expropriation case, 'no, the right to expropriate is integral part of the franchise if approved, and MORE Power will definitely pay just compensation to PECO as determined by the court.\n\nWell, if we're still on the premise that there is a failure to reach an agreement, MORE Power will have a standby quick maintenance and response team which we are in the process of putting together that we can readily deploy in case there will be a need, in case of emergency situations where major installation like substations will be compromised. We are also in the process of already looking for a possible mobile standby substations that will be backed-up by the emergency response team. And these are facilities that are readily available. Now, for the technical and operational readiness, our... well, we're contemplating that the emergency response team which is made up of engineers, technicians, and specialists who will man important facilities/like substations are ready on call for a 24/7 deployment. Standby mobile substations in case of emergency, third-party line maintenance team and crew is also being ... we're in the process of already getting these team. The third party meter readers, as well as, we will make sure that the customer relations desk would be available 24/7 also in cooperation with the different media outlets to make sure that if there are questions or maybe any confusion ...\n\nMR. CASTRO. (Continuing) ... confusion from the customer side, we will be able to respond to those queries. Well, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market. Now, on human resources, MORE Power will hire the services of the current employees who may be willing to work with us. MORE Power will hire a competent local HR Manager and, as we speak now, we actually already have applications from different... from a number of HR practitioners from Iloilo, 'no, to lay down the process of employment and among this, priority is really giving the training and development of its employees. Plans and programs-well, this is on the assumption that, well, the... we're able to come in which is... which has been laid down in the plans and programs that we've submitted to the Committee. We will make a thorough system audit. Prepare the necessary repair maintenance and even... well, from the audit, I think we'll be able to already find out if what are the improvements, immediate medium-term and long-term improvements, that will be needed. And immediately deploy the SCADA system throughout the franchise area. Well, on the distribution plan, well, I think these are some details already which we can move to the next. So, in conclusion, MORE Power will be prepared to implement the following from transition period and bring it to normal operations as soon as possible. Again, the smooth transition of normal operations including hiring of deserving employees, infusion of sufficient funding, develop and design the new distribution system, develop/implement new set of maintenance operating rules, the balance of energy, continuous training, improve responsiveness increase system, reliability and bring down the systems loss. With that, I'd like to thank the Committee for giving us the opportunity to present the transition plan. Thank you.\n\n\u2026.\n\nREP. PADUANO. It's still pending in the Committee. Now, Mr. Chair, just an observation during the presentation of the MORE. Kasi nandun nakalagay, ongoing 'yung negotiation with the PECO para... to take over. So, ang tanong ko, Mr. Chair, ano na ngayon ang status ng negotiation? Kasi, Mr. Chair, 'pag binigyan natin ng prangkisa itong MORE, it follows dapat banda sila. Kasi the consumers in Panay Island, hindi puwedeng maghintay, hindi ba? Hindi puwedeng maghintay. 'Yung question nung expropriation, if we give them the franchise. But what if... what if. .. if we also renew the franchise, 'di ba? If we... if this Committee and this House will renew their franchise, it follows na mas nauna 'to, ang PECO, mas sila ang nagsisimula sa ngayon, 'di ba? Sa ngayon sila. Of course, it is allowed, it's a free competition. But 'yung point ko, 'yung sinasabi niyong negotiation in the presentation, siguro naman dapat malaman natin kung ano na ang status ng negotiation. And nandito rin pala 'yung mga taga-PECO. Kasi, Mr. Chair, 'yun 'yung sinasabi ko, eh, if we grant MORE because free competition natin, now... and we also grant the renewal, it follows 'yung PECO naghahanda pa. If negotiation between PE... no, 'yung MORE, if negotiation between PECO and MORE failed kung i-grant natin ang PECO and there is a pending bill in this Committee. So, Mr. Chair, I just want to be clarified about the ongoing negotiation. 'Wag muna tayo pumunta doon sa question nung granting of franchise kasi, what if it failed? I-expropriate niyo, eh, there's a pending application in this Committee, this House. So, medyo may problema tayo doon. Kaya 'yung position or proposal, 'yung negotiation, medyo may problema tayo if PECO will not negotiate with you. Walang compromise, walang agreement. Now, the question is, are you prepared? Kung kompetisyon, okay. No problem with that. But 'yung sinasabi ko existing ... existing ngayon 'yung PECO and they are applying for renewal. 'Yun lang 'yung... 'yun lang 'yung medyo mahirap kong intindihin, 'no. Hindi ko maintindihan na ongoing 'yung negotiation, nag apply din sila, 'yung PECO, for renewal. So... Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n\u2026.\nMR. CASTRO. Well, next... sorry, Mr. Chair, next slide, please. Well, there was no mention that there is an ongoing negotiation, I mean, just to clarify. What we said is that, upon granting of the franchise, we will start... we will negotiate with PECO. So, there has been no statement about an ongoing negotiation.\n\nMr. Chair. Atty. Benny?\n\nMR. TAN. Your Honor, we would prefer to negotiate so... we are not sure if we'll get our franchise so it would be presumptuous to negotiate now. Once it becomes clear that we will be able to get our franchise, we have to hurdle Senate pa. Then, we will negotiate with PECO. You mentioned the possibility that PECO will also get its franchise. Yeah, in that situation, it will be an open competition, so we will not be able to... to acquire their distribution assets. We will have to build our own distribution assets in such situation where there are two franchise holder for the same area, Your Honor.\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. OFALSA. Okay. The letter is dated September 2018, addressed to Honorable Franz Alvarez, Chairperson, Committee on Legislative Franchise. \"During the House Representatives' Committee on Legislative Franchises hearing on House Bill No. 81 last September 12, 2018, the Energy Regulatory Commission was directed to submit its supplemental position paper on the said bill. In compliance with the said directive, please find attached ERC's Supplemental Position Paper in response to the queries and additional information requested during the hearing. We hope that the Committee will consider the same during the deliberation of this piece of legislation. Thank you.\" Signed by Chairperson and CEO, Agnes V.S.T. Devanadera.\n\nThe letter... the title of this position is ERC's Supplemental Position Paper on House Bill No. 8132, AN ACT GRANTING THE MORE MINERALS CORPORATION A FRANCHISE TO ESTABLISH, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR CONVEYANCE OF ELECTRIC POWER TO END-USERS IN THE CITY OF ILOILO, IN THE PROVINCE OF ILOILO.\n\nDuring the Committee on Legislative Franchises' hearing on House Bill 81 last September 18, 2018, legal issues and operational concerns on the occurrence of any of the following scenarios were raised, namely....\n\nWe go now to scenario number two - where franchise is granted to MMC and PECOs franchise is not renewed. PECO is the existing franchise electric utility with exclusive authority to operate and maintain a distribution system in Iloilo City. As such, PECO owns the only existing distribution assets in Iloilo City. In the event that PECO's franchise is not renewed and another entity that is MMC is given the franchise to operate and maintain a distribution system in Iloilo City, a question was raised on whether PECO will be allowed to operate the existing distribution system during the transition phase of MORE Minerals. As earlier pointed out in the supplemental position paper, an entity operating and maintaining a distribution system must first secure a franchise. In the case of PECO, once existing franchise expires, it may no longer in the business of distribution of electricity and ERC has no legal basis to issue any authority to PECO for the latter to operate its distribution system. As ERC has no authority over PECO after the expiration of the latter's franchise, the ERC will defer to the wisdom of the Congress on whether to grant PECO a legislative franchise that will allow PECO to continue operating its distribution system.\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. INOCENCIO FERRER, JR. (Board Member, Panay Electric Company). Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Sorry but I have flu, 'no, so my voice is not very clear. I am Atty. Inocencio Ferrer, Jr. I represent PECO and the majority of the Board Members of PECO. Mr. Chairman, we have previously filed several letters opposing the House Bill of Congressman Gus Tambunting. And in answer directly to the question of whether or not PECO is amenable to selling its assets or the company to MORE, I can categorically say... state that after conferring with the majority owners of PECO, they are not amenable to sell their assets and they will contest and bring to court any move by MORE to use the government power to expropriate their assets and give it to a private entity . It is our position, Mr. Chairman, that based on the presentation of the President of MORE, he actually admitted that they don't have any assets on the electrical power distribution. He admitted that. In fact, his only plan is to buy us out and if we refuse to sell, then he will invoke the government... the government... he will use the government to expropriate our assets and award it to a private entity. Number two, the President of MORE admitted now, that's why I wanted him to admit it under oath that they don't have any personnel. They don't have any technicians, experts in the field of electric power distribution and their only plan is to hire our employees. Third, Your Honor, I don't think what he presented is a rollout plan. Usually, a rollout plan tells the Honorable Members the year-to-year activities of MORE to purchase equipment, to install equipment, to apply for permits on the barangay level, the city level to install their infrastructure. They should present that to the Chairman year-to-year. Every year how much assets they will buy. Every year, how many employees they will hire. Every year, how many equipment that they will purchase. But they have not submitted a rollout plan. Instead, what they are actually telling the public is they will invoke the power of the Constitution to expropriate our property and to award it to a private entity. I think, Your Honor, that will violate the Anti-Graft Law. Anyway, we will question that in the Supreme Court. Your Honor, may I, again, ask the Chairman to distribute the various opposition... the various opposition submitted to this Honorable Committee against... the opposition against... the very strong opposition against the application of MORE. In fact, the biggest association of power distributors, electric power distributors, in the Philippines submitted a very, very strong objection. They are the expert in the field and this association, PEPOA, they are called PEPOA, and PEPOA is a Private Electric Power Operators Association of the Philippines, the only expert association of private operator, strongly oppose the application of MORE because they don't have any assets. MORE does not have a single asset on the ground now in Iloilo City, nothing. Their only plan is just to expropriate our property and allow the government to pay us in court. Second, the Private Electric Power Operators Association, which represents all... all the private electric power distributors in the country, strongly supported the House Bill of Congressman Xavier Jesus Romualdo, House Bill 6023, in favor of PECO.... Finally, Your Honor, at that time that MORE filed its application on August 22, less than 40 days ago, MORE was a mining company. It was a mining company with only 2.5 million pesos capital and it did not have a single experience or track record in electric power distribution. Therefore, at that time they filed the application, they were not entitled. They were not qualified. And if they are now submitting the amendment of their Article, it merely states that they have... what? Two hundred fifty million pesos and they are going to try to takeover a multi\u00ad billion peso existing electric power distribution. That is incredible...\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Thank you very much, Your Honor. Well, just to reiterate, well, what we've stated during the first hearing. Yes, while we still don't have the ... I would say, the... the full complement, but, well, at the officers' level , we actually have an experienced general manager of an electric cooperative which is about three times, at least three times bigger than PECO, with a customer base of over 200 thousand, and by experience, was able to bring down systems losses from double digit to single digit, 'no. We have another general manager of another electric coop who will be joining us very soon. Again, his experience is a customer base four times bigger than that of PECO. PECO is about 60 thousand. This another GM that we are-and I'm not yet in the position to name him-actually has been managing electric coop of another urbanized area of about 225 thousand customers, ano. And experience would show na in his management, he was able to bring down systems losses and was able to turn around the... the financials of this utility from barely negative to positive. Also together with us is a former Undersecretary of Energy and former NAPOCOR President, Cyril Del Callar, who is very much acquainted with the power industry from the very time he joined, well, his law profession in the power industry and up to this date. Well, on the... on the owner's side, Monte Oro was also ... we were part owner of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippine, when we privatized TransCo, 'no. And NGCP, we won the bid for 3.95 billion U.S. Dollars and we were able to ... well, we had... we have the capital, we had the we were able to comply with what was needed on the financial side, needed by the by the government that's why we were awarded that franchise for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. And as we had... we have the capital, we had the we were able to comply with what was needed on the financial side, needed by the by the government that's why we were awarded that franchise for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. And as we....\n\nREP. A. M. BRAVO. Thank you very much, idol. Assuming that MORE is capable of putting up the infrastructure, questioning their capability maybe, well, not proper as of this present as made mentioned by the author that it requires first a franchise so that they will be able to build up the facilities. Assuming that they are capable of building up and maybe to ... after such build up they will be ready to propel the business in favor of the consumer it will take how many years do you think to do it?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Well, in our...\n\nREP. A. M. BRAVO. On an assumption that PECO will not sell.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Mr. Chair, Honorable Chair, in our opinion, well, since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right , Mr. Chair. Thank you.\n\n\u2026.\n\nREP. ANICETO JOHN D. BERTIZ. Idol ko 'yun si Bravo, pero I'm so honored that I was called. Good morning po, good morning, Mr. Chair. Actually, my question is in line with the... just a follow-up question with Congressman Anthony Bravo. Of course, it is incumbent for us, for this Committee to know what arc the transitory plans and I would like to ask more... no, I mean, I will not ask more but the MORE Mineral Corporation to know about what is your immediate plan because our worry is from now until January when PECO expires, what will be your immediate plan? Because you know, that's the only time you will start putting up your electric posts, whatsoever, power plant, et cetera, et cetera, clearances, right of way, issues, trees to be cut, DENR, et cetera, et cetera. So, ano 'yung mangyayari? Comes January, na ano ang mangyayari doon sa ilang libong consumers or users ng existing power plant? So I just would like to know what is your immediate '\" because, you know, we cannot leave those thousands of families, you know, push them back to the dark ages especially in Iloilo. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON. Mr. Castro.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Your Honor, well, we presented earlier the transition plan when the hearing started, 'no, but just to summarize, it's well, once we are granted of franchise, in good faith we would negotiate with PECO on the purchase of their distribution assets. If there's a failure in that respect, well, there is the imbedded in the franchise, the expropriation. Well, the other option actually is that we can come up in well, as stated earlier, within a year, at least we can come up with our own facilities, Mr. Chair. That in essence are the three points that we've presented earlier. Thank you. [27]\n\nI purposely quoted at length the congressional deliberations to prove that the business plan has all along been to take PECO's properties at all costs since these properties , as cleverly decreed in Section 10 , are those properties \"actually necessary\" for the establishment and operation of MORE's franchise. It has to be that way because petitioner MORE has none of the facilities to distribute electricity to consumers.\n\nExpropriation is a foregone conclusion; it is the only way by which MORE as the new franchisee can establish and operate the distribution of electricity; without expropriation , since PECO is not willing to sell its assets, Iloilo residents will suffer a black-out . The impact of Section 10 and Section 17, as their respective texts prove and as envisioned by the legislators , is to render the condemnation a fait accompli , and the provision on expropriation proceedings a ceremonial procedure .\n\nThat the legislative record reveals much concern about protecting the business of MORE by volunteering the taking of PECO's properties is nothing but consistent with House Bill 8132's conclusion that \" [t]he quality of service of PECO has been wanting Among the complaints against PECO are: overbilling/overcharging, arrogant personnel/poor customer relations, distributor related outages, inadequately maintained lines, inadequate investment in distribution facilities, and inordinate delay in the restoration of power services, among others .\"\n\nPECO's representative was even invited to give a statement on MORE's application for a franchise in what appeared to be a congressional trial of PECO's alleged failings. Apart from the non-renewal of its franchise and the award thereof to MORE , the takeover of PECO's properties by MORE is the legislative punishment for PECO's purported failings.\n\nMORE's business plan and congressional intent are relevant to the conclusion that Sections 10 and 17 are indeed bills of attainder because they follow the template as to why bills of attainer are enacted and why they should be banned . The template has been elucidated as follows:\n\nWe have just seen the danger that arises when a legislature acts in a judicial capacity and enacts bills of attainder to take private property, while simultaneously asserting that its actions are consistent with the law of the land. That discussion was missing only one important ingredient - motive . This section discusses f actions as the motive for legislative defiance of due process . Once the ban on bills of attainder is by far the best aid in understanding why factions are so dangerous.\n\nWhy would a legislature be tempted to defy due process, take property without compensation, and declare that its acts are above judicial review? What possible motive could elected officials have for such misguided behavior? Factions are the answer. For a surprisingly clear statement as to why this is so, we tum to governmental genius James Madison. If anyone understood the workings and dangers of government, he did. Madison directly linked property takings, governmental factions, and rogue legislatures acting in a judicial capacity.\n\nThe occasion for Madison's interweaving of these topics was The Federalist No. 10. This is perhaps the single most famous of the Federalist papers penned by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, and is best known for discussing the dangers of factions. What is less known is that this essay also related directly to bills of attainder and eminent domain takings as well.\n\nIn the middle of The Federalist No. 10, Madison made the seemingly innocent comment that \"no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause.\" This seems self-evident. How can a man judge whether he is worthy of punishment? But Madison then took this simple concept one step further and applied it to the workings of government - more specifically, the legislature . He said: \"[A] body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens?\" In other words, Madison raised the very point discussed by Webster and Hamilton above. The legislature is tempted constantly to step into the judicial sphere, unless something prevents it from doing so. While Webster and Hamilton spoke in terms of individualized legislation, such as bills of attainder targeted at persons or small groups of people, Madison spread the canvas farther. Was not the same principle true when large groups were targeted for unfair treatment as well? Could not such far-reaching laws also be bills of attainder?\n\nAnd just what were the groups that comprised opposing factions? Madison gave the answer in no uncertain terms: \"The most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\" Madison was no communist, however, and he was not in any way criticizing an unequal distribution of property or asserting that there should be a redistribution of the same to make everyone equal. For him, such a proposition would be impossible, since the acquisition of property was derived from the very unique personalities of individual men. He referred to this concept as \"the diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate.\" Then came his key point - that it was the government's job to protect and preserve such individual faculties, which in turn would forever preserve factions :\n\nThe protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.\n\nWhat type of government would preserve property factions as necessary and unavoidable elements of society, while at the same time preventing them from controlling the legislature and exceeding its powers through bills of attainder? A large republic, answered Madison in The Federalist No. 10 - a republic in which small groups of representatives from large and distant population centers would effectively hold each other in check.\n\nOf course, Madison believed that the most effective way the Congress could accomplish this task was through a legislative veto , as he had originally proposed. This legislative veto, however, had been overturned and replaced with a judicial veto over unacceptable state acts, such as the ban on bills of attainder . Madison still hoped and believed that the structure of the federal republic, combined with the limits in Article I, Section 10, would provide the needed protection against factions. He stated in the Federalist No. 44:\n\nBills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation ... Very properly, therefore, has the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights ... The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences , in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators ...\n\nMadison was not the only one who said that the ban on bills of attainder was the chief vehicle to overcome the dangers of factions. Justice Iredell in Minge v. Gilmour said:\n\nIn times of violent faction or confusion of any kind, men are often prompted, if they can, to destroy their adversaries under the color of the law. The numerous acts of attainder in England, and other arbitrary parliamentary punishments, show how necessary it was for a wise people, forming a constitution for themselves, to guard against tyrannies like these.\n\n\u2026.\nIn sum, the greatest fear of the founding generation was that the factions - which are always present in society, and which arise because of unavoidable differences in property ownership - would use the government itself to oppress their fellow citizens. The founders hoped that the nature of America's large republic would overcome this problem. But if the republic failed to do so fully, a very specific ban on egregious, faction-based takings legislation could also be used as a protection. This protection was the ban on bills of attainder. [28]\n\nD. Conclusion\n\nAdmittedly, the use of the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection has long faded. Nonetheless, it does not need to be that way. As has been said:\n\nThe ban on bills of attainder still stands as a bulwark of liberty to those whose property is arbitrarily taken by an unjustified legislative act. The provision itself has not changed, but only our understanding of it. The provision can protect both persons and groups who for a time are unpopular - such as those of Japanese descent in World War II, suspected communists in the 1950s, or suspected terrorists today - as well as persons or groups that own property the government wants, and then exerts pressure to obtain. Courts today should not be afraid to apply this unique and powerful tool as it was applied in the days of our early history . And when they do, courts will discover that it clarifies many other constitutional principles as well. [29]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nII. | Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection clause.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nII. Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection clause.\n\nIn Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010 , [30] the Court nullified then President Aquino's Executive Order No. 1 creating the Truth Commission and tasking it to investigate reported cases of graft and corruption allegedly committed during the presidency of President Macapagal-Arroyo. The Court held that this executive rule violated the equal protection clause, viz .:\n\nThe equal protection clause is aimed at all official state actions, not just those of the legislature. Its inhibitions cover all the departments of the government including the political and executive departments, and extend to all actions of a state denying equal protection of the laws, through whatever agency or whatever guise is taken.\n\nIt, however, does not require the universal application of the laws to all persons or things without distinction. What it simply requires is equality among equals as determined according to a valid classification. Indeed, the equal protection clause permits classification. Such classification, however, to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness. The test has four requisites: (1) The classification rests on substantial distinctions; (2) It is germane to the purpose of the law; (3) It is not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) It applies equally to all members of the same class. \"Superficial differences do not make for a valid classification.\"\n\nFor a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class....\n\nThe classification must not be based on existing circumstances only, or so constituted as to preclude addition to the number included in the class. It must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances and conditions. It must not leave out or \"under include\" those that should otherwise fall into a certain classification....\n\nApplying these precepts to this case, Executive Order No. 1 should be struck down as violative of the equal protection clause. The clear mandate of the envisioned truth commission is to investigate and find out the truth \"concerning the reported cases of graft and corruption during the previous administration\" only. The intent to single out the previous administration is plain, patent and manifest . Mention of it has been made in at least three portions of the questioned executive order. Specifically, these are ....\n\nIn this regard, it must be borne in mind that the Arroyo administration is but just a member of a class, that is, a class of past administrations. It is not a class of its own. Not to include past administrations similarly situated constitutes arbitrariness which the equal protection clause cannot sanction. Such discriminating differentiation clearly reverberates to label the commission as a vehicle for vindictiveness and selective retribution.\n\u2026.\nTo reiterate, in order for a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class. \"Such a classification must not be based on existing circumstances only, or so constituted as to preclude additions to the number included within a class , but must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances and conditions. Furthermore, all who are in situations and circumstances which are relative to the discriminatory legislation and which are indistinguishable from those of the members of the class must be brought under the influence of the law and treated by it in the same way as are the members of the class.\"\n\nHere, Sections 10 and 17 are directed only against respondent PECO . While the language of these provisions may be construed to refer to property owners other than PECO , the congressional deliberations made it very clear and categorical that the take-over is solely with regard to PECO and its properties . The overriding intent is the legislated taking, condemnation of expropriation of PECO's assets and no other entity's properties , because this is petitioner MORE's business plan as it has none of the facilities to establish and operate the distribution of electricity within its franchise area. This is the same evil that Biraogo has railed against, the singling out of a person for the imposition of burdens that and whenever the singled out person is not willing to accept .\n\nIndeed, what differentiates respondent PECO from other property owners? PECO is not the only entity that has \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment. \" As admitted by petitioner MORE ,\n\nWell, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market.\n\n... since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean l think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right. . .\n\nHence, there is no basis for Sections 10 and 17 to single out PECO for the take-over and condemnation of its properties and to drive it altogether from doing other legitimate businesses as regards its assets.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nIII. | Response to Key Points in the Resolution Denying the Motion for reconsideration.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nIII. Response to Key Points in the Resolution Denying the Motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe reference to an expropriation proceeding now before the trial court strengthens the view that MORE has been true to its business plan of merely taking over PECO's properties to establish, operate and maintain its franchise. The statement that\"[o]wnership was co-existent with the franchise\" further proves that the confiscation of PECO's properties is the Congress' primordial means of supporting MORE's franchise.\n\nIndeed, Congress through Sections 10 and 17 has already determined and settled the issues inherent in an otherwise judicial expropriation proceeding. The court expropriation case has become and will be a fait accompli , a ceremonial figurehead .\n\nAdditionally, the public purpose for the expropriation did not arise because, to quote the ponencia , \"MORE is the new franchise holder in a city whose public space is already burdened by an existing distribution system, and that distribution system cannot continue to serve a public use for it is owned by the old franchise holder.\"\n\nRather , the public use came about because MORE has had none of the facilities and the people to establish, operate and maintain the franchise. The fact that PECO has its facilities in the franchise area does not justify the expropriation, because there would have been no use for these facilities if only MORE has been equipped and skilled to perform the franchise it sought and was awarded .\n\nIt is unfair and out-of-line to turn the tables on PECO when it is MORE that has no equipment and people to make its franchise useful to the people it is intended to serve.\n\nFor clarification, what I claim to be bills of attainder are Section 10 and Section 17 of MORE's franchise, and certainly not the denial of PECO's franchise. The latter is not the subject matter of this case and therefore I cannot have assailed or challenged it in my dissent. In any event, the grant or denial of a franchise begins and ends with Congress \u2013 that is a given.\n\nWhat I point out as bills of attainder are Section 10 and Section 17 RA 11212 , which have burdened PECO with the fait accompli expropriation or taking of its property in a manner that dispenses with the judicial trial on whether public use and public necessity are present in the take-over of PECO properties. Here, it was Congress itself that has become not only the initial but also the final arbiter of what essentially has always been a judicial function .\n\nTo be sure, the denial of PECO's franchise and the grant of franchise to MORE did not have to come with the added burden to PECO of a legislatively determined expropriation of PECO's assets. The two actions are actually separable from each other, and hence, a challenge on the latter does not amount to an attack on the former.\n\nIn any event, there is a huge difference between a consensual acquisition of another's property and a forcible or coercive take-over thereof. The latter is an exercise of State power that the Constitution restrains. While a legislation may authorize its exercise and initially determines the propriety of its exercise, it is a court decree that makes the ultimate lawfully binding determination on the basis of the existence of public use and public necessity and the payment of just compensation. In the case at bar, the process has been skewed because Section 10 and Section 17 of RA 11212 themselves, as confirmed by the legislative deliberations, have adjudged with finality the existence of the elements that should have been the court's prerogative to adjudicate. Even the Court, though it is not the expropriation court, has already found in the present case and on the basis or upon the lead of Section 10 and Section 17, that the take-over is for a public use and publicly necessary.\n\nI agree that \"the power of expropriation is by no means absolute.\" But the power of eminent domain is not only limited by public use and just compensation ; genuine public necessity and the proscription against bills of attainder similarly restrict the exercise of this State power.\n\nI therefore disagree with the thought that \"the Constitution does not sanction the taking of a private [property]\" only if \"the sole purpose\" thereof is to transfer it to another private party. Sole means only, one and only, single, solitary, lone, unique. But then even the confluence of private and public benefits, not solely the conferment of private benefits, may destroy the public use claim of an expropriation \"when the purported public use is merely incidental or pretextual, thereby serving as a guise to favor private interests.\" Clearly , the fact that there is a gloss of public use to a taking does not end the debate simply because it is not the sole purpose of the taking to benefit a private party. The incidental or pretextual public use defense has been explained in this manner:\n\nWhen determining the limits of the government's right to take private property, we will defer to the General [***36] Assembly's exercise of those powers. Id. at 543; SWIDA, 199 Ill. 2d at 236 (\"Great deference should be afforded the legislature and its granting of eminent domain authority.\"). Under SWIDA, that deference evaporates when the public purpose behind the taking is a pretext, when a municipality uses eminent domain as a weapon to forcibly transfer property from one private owner to another . See SWIDA, 199 Ill. 2d at 240 (\"While [SWIDA's] activities here were undertaken in the guise of carrying out its legislated mission, SWIDA's true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use.\"); Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut , 545 U.S. 469,478, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005) (noting government would not be allowed \"to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow private benefit .\"); cf. Franco v. National Capital Revitalization Corp ., 930 A.2d 160, 169 (D.C. 2007) (finding \"pretext\" to be valid affirmative defense to condemnation for economic redevelopment).\n\nRecognizing the difference between a valid public use and a sham can be challenging. But a telling feature of sound public use in the context of economic redevelopment is the existence of a well-developed, publicly vetted, and thoughtful economic development plan. Such a plan was present in Kelo , 545 U.S. at 483-84, and Gutknecht, 3 Ill. 2d at 542-43, but absent in SWIDA , 199 Ill. 2d at 240 (\"SWIDA did not conduct or commission [***37] a thorough study of the parking situation at [the racetrack]. Nor did it formulate any economic plan requiring additional parking at the racetrack.\"). A taking will likely pass constitutional muster where done in furtherance of a sound economic development plan, rather than [****432] [**522] the plan retroactively justifying the taking . Cf. Romeo v. Cranston Redevelopment Agency , 105 R.I. 651, 254 A.2d 426, 433 (R.I. 1969) (\"governing bodies must either plan for the development or redevelopment of urban areas or permit them to become more congested, deteriorated, obsolescent, unhealthy, stagnant, inefficient and costly\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). [31]\n\nAs has been copiously quoted and also explained at length, MORE's business plan from the beginning has been to take over PECO's properties. There was no well-developed, publicly vetted, and thoughtful plan as the idea was simply to take and justify this taking by retroactively referring to MORE's business plan of simply taking over PECO's properties.\n\nIn Southwestern Ill. Dev. Auth. v. Nat'l City Envtl., L.L.C. , [32] a government agency sought to expropriate private parcels of land to be conveyed to a private race track which would then build additional parking spaces for its clientele. The court ruled that the public benefits arising from the parking spaces were merely incidental and pretextual to the profit motivation of the private race track. Thus:\n\nIf this taking were allowed to stand, it may be true that spectators at Gateway would benefit greatly. Developing additional parking could benefit the members of the public who choose to attend events at the racetrack, as spectators may often have to wait in long lines of traffic to park their vehicles and again to depart the facility. We also acknowledge that a public use or purpose may be satisfied in light of public safety concerns. See Illinois Toll Highway Comm'n v. Eden Cemetery Ass'n , 16 Ill. 2d 539, 158 N.E.2d 766 (1959). The public is allowed to park on the property in exchange for the payment of a fee. Gateway's racetrack may be open to the public, but not \"by right.\" Gaylord, 204 Ill. at 584. It is a private venture designed to [*239] result not in a public use, but in private profits . If this taking were permitted, lines to enter parking lots might be shortened and pedestrians might [***21] be able to cross from parking areas to event areas in a safer manner. However , we are unpersuaded that these facts alone are sufficient to satisfy the public use requirement , especially in light of evidence that Gateway could have built a parking garage structure on its existing property .\n\nWe have also recognized that economic development is an important public purpose . See People ex rel. City of Canton v. Crouch , 79 Ill. 2d 356, 38 Ill. Dec. 154, 403 N.E.2d 242 (1980); People ex rel. City of Urbana v. Paley , 68 Ill. 2d 62, 11 Ill. Dec. 307, 368 N.E.2d 915 (1977); People ex rel. City of Salem v. McMackin , 53 Ill. 2d 347, 291 N.E.2d 807 (1972). SWIDA presented extensive testimony that expanding Gateway's facilities through the taking of NCE's property would allow it to grow and prosper and contribute to positive economic growth in the region. However, \"incidentally, every lawful business does this. \" Gaylord, 204 Ill. at 586. Moreover, nearly a century ago, Gaylord expressed the long-standing rule that \"to constitute a public use, something more than a mere benefit to the public must flow from the contemplated improvement . [***22] \"Gaylord, 204 Ill. at 584.\n\nThis case is strikingly similar to our earlier decision in Limits Industrial R.R. Co. v. American Spiral Pipe Works , 321 Ill. 101, 151 N .E. 567 (1926). In Limits Industrial, this court held that a railroad could not exercise eminent domain authority to acquire property for the purpose of expanding its facilities. Despite a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission, we found the proposed spur track and public [**10] [****250] freight house provided minimal public benefit and principally benefitted the railroad itself and a few other business entities . Limits Industrial, 321 Ill. at 109-10. Similarly, it is incumbent upon us to question SWIDA's findings as to the parking situation at Gateway and determine whether [*240] the true beneficiaries of this taking are private businesses and not the public .\n\nWe do not require a bright-line test to find that this taking bestows a purely private benefit and lacks a showing of a supporting legislative purpose. As was the case in Limits Industrial, members of the public are not the primary intended beneficiaries of this taking . Limits Industrial, 321 Ill. at 109-10. [***23] This condemnation clearly was intended to assist Gateway in accomplishing their goals in a swift, economical, and profitable manner.\n\nEntities such as SWIDA must always be mindful of expediency, cost efficiency, and profitability while accepting the legislature's charge to promote development within their defined parameters. However, these goals must not be allowed to overshadow the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of the power with which SWIDA and similar entities have been entrusted. As Justice Kuehn stated in dissent in the appellate court, \"If property ownership is to remain what our forefathers intended it to be, if it is to remain a part of the liberty we cherish, the economic by-products of a private capitalist's ability to develop land cannot justify a surrender of ownership to eminent domain .\" 304 Ill. App. 3d at 556 (Kuehn, J., specially concurring).\n\nWhile the activities here were undertaken in the guise of carrying out its legislated mission, SWIDA's true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use. SWIDA did not conduct or commission a thorough study of the parking situation [***24] at Gateway. Nor did it formulate any economic plan requiring additional parking at the racetrack. SWIDA advertised that, for a fee, it would condemn land at the request of \"private developers\" for the \"private use\" of developers. In addition, SWIDA entered into a contract with Gateway to condemn whatever land \"may be desired ***by Gateway.\" Clearly, [*241] the foundation of this taking is rooted not in the economic and planning process with which SWIDA has been charged. Rather, this action was undertaken solely in response to Gateway's expansion goals and its failure to accomplish those goals through purchasing NCE's land at an acceptable negotiated price. It appears SWIDA's true intentions were to act as a default broker of land for Gateway's proposed parking plan.\n\nThis point is further emphasized by the fact that other options were available to Gateway that could have addressed many of the problems testified to by Pritchett, Ortbals and others. Gateway could have built a parking garage structure on its existing property rather than develop the land owned by NCE. However, when Gateway discovered that the cost of constructing a garage on land it already owned was substantially higher than [***25] using SWIDA as its agent to take NCE's property for open-field parking, Gateway chose the easier and less expensive avenue.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of NCE's property, Gateway could realize an estimated increase of $ 13 to $ 14 million in projected revenue per year. While we do not deny that this expansion in revenue could potentially trickle down and bring corresponding revenue increases to the region, revenue expansion alone does not justify an improper and unacceptable expansion [**11] [****251] of the eminent domain power of the government. Using the power of the government for purely private purposes to allow Gateway to avoid the open real estate market and expand its facilities in a more cost-efficient manner, and thus maximizing corporate profits, is a misuse of the power entrusted by the public.\n\nThe legislature intended that SWIDA actively foster economic development and expansion in Madison and St. Clair Counties. 70 ILCS 520/2(g), 5 (West 1998). However, the actions of SWlDA in this case blur the lines between [*242] a public use and a private purpose. A highway toll authority may justify the use of eminent domain to ensure that motorists have reasonable access [***26] to gas stations. Illinois Toll Highway Comm'n, 16 Ill. 2d at 546. Does the highway authority's power include the ability to use eminent domain authority to take additional land for a car wash, and then a lube shop? Could the authority then use its power to facilitate additional expansions for a motel, small retail shops, and entertainment centers? The initial, legitimate development of a public project does not justify condemnation for any and all related business expansions.\n\nSWIDA contends that the \"wisdom *** of the legislation and 'the means of executing the project' are beyond judicial scrutiny 'once the public purpose has been established.' It is that purpose which controls and not the 'means' or 'mechanics' of how the purpose is carried out.\" We disagree. The Constitution and the essential liberties we are sworn to protect control. In its wisdom, the legislature has given SWIDA the authority to use eminent domain power to encourage private enterprise and become involved in commercial projects that may benefit a specific region of this state. While we do not question the legislature's discretion in allowing for the exercise of eminent domain power, \"the government [***27] does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights.\" Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp ., 458 U.S. 419, 439, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 885, 102 S. Ct. 3164, 3178 (1982). The power of eminent domain is to be exercised with restraint, not abandon.\n\nHere, Sections 10 and 17 have become the default broker for MORE . The latter could have discovered that the cost of building facilities for the distribution of electricity was substantially higher than using these assailed provisions as its agent to take PECO's properties. MORE chose the easier and less expensive avenue to exercise its franchise.\n\nThe actual purpose for the expropriation of PECO's properties has been to bestow a private benefit on MORE's exercise of its franchise that it could not have fulfilled otherwise. But for MORE's inability to provide the facilities and technical knowhow to establish and operate its franchise, and MORE's ultimate business plan to take-over and raid PECO's facilities, the expropriation of PECO's properties would not have come to pass and would not have been made necessary. Verily, Sections 10 and 17 have been meant to operationalize a business plan to benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals \u2013 MORE . In relation to this, PECO has been singled out with the expropriation of its properties without a judicial trial.\n\nIt is the opinion of the majority that under Sections 10 and 17 the expropriation of PECO's properties \u2013 including, but not limited to its poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment \u2013 is intended for public use and demanded by public necessity. With this determination, what else are we to expect from the lower court hearing the expropriation proceedings? This confirms what I have been saying all along that PECO has been singled out and punished for its alleged poor services through the take-over of its properties whose validity and legitimacy have been settled by legislative fiat through Sections 10 and 17.\n\nACCORDINGLY , I vote to GRANT the Motion for reconsideration of Panay Electric Company, Inc. and REINSTATE the trial court's Judgment dated July 1, 2019, declaring Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 UNCONSTITUTIONAL for being bills of attainder and for being violative of the equal protection clause.\n\n[1] 651 Phil. 374 (2010).\n\n[2] United States v.

April 4, 2002).\n\nCONCURRING OPINION\n\nINTING, J .:\n\nI am reconsidering my vote in the Decision [1] dated September 1 2020 and find that Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. (RA) 11212 [2] which grant MORE Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) the right of eminent domain are constitutional.\n\nSections 1 0 and 17 of RA 11212 provide:\n\nSECTION 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services . The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided , That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid.\n\nProvided, further , That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.\n\nx x x x\n\nSECTION 17. Transition of Operations . \u2014 In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and its complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC, which period shall m no case exceed two (2) years from the grant of this legislative franchise.\n\nUpon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the necessary provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by ERC.\n\nThis provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it. x x x x (Italics in the original and supplied.)\n\nEminent domain is defined as \"the power of the nation or a sovereign state to take, or to authorize the taking of, private property for a public use without the owner's consent, conditioned upon payment of just compensation.\" [3]\n\nThe power of eminent domain is exercised by Congress. However, as cited in the ponencia , the Court discussed in Manapat v. Court of Appeals [4] that Congress which possesses the power of eminent domain may delegate such power to the President, administrative bodies, local government units and even to private enterprises performing public services . By way of a footnote to this discussion, the Court explained that \"[u]nder existing laws, quasi-public corporations such as the Philippine National Railways, the PLDT and Meralco have been granted the power of expropriation.\" [5]\n\nFurther, the exercise of the power of eminent domain is subject to limitations under the 1987 Constitution, i.e .: (1) that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation as provided in Section 9, Article III; and (2) that no person shall be deprived of his/her life, liberty, or property without due process of law as provided in Section 1, Article III. [6]\n\nGuided by this discussion, I find that the delegation of the power of eminent domain in favor of MORE under Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 is constitutional for the following reasons:\n\nFirst , as discussed by the ponencia , MORE is a private enterprise allowed by Congress to operate a public utility for public interest. Specifically, MORE was granted a franchise for the purpose of \"establish[ing], operat[ing], and maintain[ing], for commercial purposes, and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the City of Iloilo.\" [7] Thus, Congress may delegate to MORE the right of eminent domain in such a manner that the delegation will not violate the constitutional safeguards for the taking of private property for public use.\n\nSecond , the delegation by Congress of the power of eminent domain to MORE is for a public use. It must be emphasized that \"[p]ublic use, as an eminent domain concept, has acquired an expansive meaning to include utility, advantage or productivity for the benefit of the public. [8] Here, without doubt, the continuous and uninterrupted distribution of electric power in Iloilo City will ultimately be of utility, advantage or productivity to Iloilo City's general public.\n\nAs emphasized by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa in his Separate Opinion to the Decision in this case, PECO is the sole operator of the electric power distribution utility in Iloilo City, a situation which is typical in the industry as the energy sector has always been a natural monopoly given the extremely high fixed costs involved. [9] With the non-renewal of PECO's franchise, a decision which is solely within the prerogative of Congress, MORE, the new franchisee must be given reasonable means to establish its service to ensure the continuous supply of electric power in Iloilo City. To my mind, the delegation of the power of eminent domain to MORE which includes the right 'to immediately possess and take over PECO's property/ies upon deposit of the assessed value of the property/ies, among other requirements, is reasonable considering that MORE is a newcomer in the industry. As aptly explained by the Court, speaking through Associate Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr. in the Decision in this case, \"MORE is x x x peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise.\" [10]\n\nI share the view of Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa that the \"Congress should not be deprived of the authority to grant new franchise holders with the power to expropriate necessary assets. To hold otherwise would effectively constrain Congress to continuously renew the existing franchise of the current operator despite its sub-par service, until another prospective operator has built its own capital assets.\" [11] And yet given the high fixed costs and other barriers to entry, a new prospective operator might be discouraged from building its own capital assets as there is even no guarantee that Congress will grant a franchise in its favor. [12]\n\nThird , I concur with the ponencia that the incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE does not render its legislative franchise unconstitutional. Such incidental benefit to MORE does not outweigh and by no means negate the benefit that will inure to the entire population of Iloilo City if MORE's power of eminent domain under Sections 10 and 17 will be upheld. Surely, the \"prevent[ion] [of] massive and prolonged economic disruption in the city, not to mention oppressive discomfort by its residents\" should not be frustrated just because of some incidental benefit that would inure to MORE. [13]\n\nFourth , the grant of the power of eminent domain to MORE under Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 does not amount to deprivation of property without due process of law. Sections 10 and 17 are not confiscatory as they do not provide for the automatic taking of PECO's property/properties without the conduct of the proper judicial proceedings for expropriation. What is evident from Section 10 is that MORE must initiate the proper expropriation proceedings in the exercise of its power of eminent domain.\n\nExpropriation consists of two stages. The Court discussed in National Power Corporation v. Posada, et al. : [14]\n\nx x x The first is concerned with the determination of the authority of the plaintiff to exercise the power of eminent domain and the propriety of its exercise in the context of the facts involved in the suit. It ends with an order, if not of dismissal of the action, \"of condemnation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be condemned, for the public use or purpose described in the complaint, upon the payment of just compensation to be determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint.\" x x x\n\nThe second phase of the eminent domain action is concerned with the determination by the Court of \"the just compensation for the property sought to be taken.\" This is done by the Court with the assistance of not more than three (3) commissioners. x x x [15] (Italics in the original.)\n\nSection 10 in particular does not render the first stage of the expropriation proceedings inutile. Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe aptly discussed in her Separate Opinion to the Decision in this case that \"the grant of the authority to expropriate is different from the propriety of the expropriation itself.\" Specifically, the present case \"only concerns the issue of constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 which provisions must be examined against the prevailing jurisprudential standard that public use is equal to 'whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare.\"' I am of the same view that the issue of whether the power of eminent domain is properly exercised by MORE as to PECO's specific property/ies is the subject matter of the appropriate expropriation proceedings. [16]\n\nFurther, as aptly pointed out by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa, Section 10 expressly provides that the authority of MORE to exercise the power of eminent domain is subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law. Specifically, Section 10 sets out a restriction on expropriation, i.e ., \"insofar as maybe necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of [MORE's] services.\" [17] Thus, in the appropriate expropriation proceedings, MORE still has the burden to establish that the property sought to be condemned is for the specific public use or purpose embodied in RA 11212.\n\nThe non-confiscatory nature of Section 10 is also highlighted by the fact that the provision does not do away with the second stage of the expropriation proceedings, i.e. , the determination of just compensation which essentially belongs to the Courts. [18]\n\nJust compensation has been defined by the Court as \"the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss.\" [19] Further, \"[t]he word 'just' is used to qualify the meaning of the word 'compensation' and to convey thereby the idea that the amount to be tendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample.\" [20]\n\nIt must be emphasized that the deposit of the assessed value of the property/ies as provided in Section 10 is merely preliminary and does not constitute the totality of the compensation to be received by PECO in the event of expropriation of its property/ies by MORE. It is also not meant to substitute the fair market value that the Government is supposed to pay to PECO under Section 4 [21] of PECO's franchise, i.e ., RA 5360, [22] in the event that the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself PECO's system and enterprise.\n\nNotably, the deposit of the assessed value as a requirement for the possession of the property/ies is not novel to RA 11212 as it is similar with Rule 67 of the Rules of Court which governs expropriation proceedings. [23] Section 2, Rule 67 provides:\n\nSEC. 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value with authorized government depositary . \u2014 Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon he possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand to the authorized government depositary.\n\nx x x x (Italics supplied.)\n\nAfter the deposit of the assessed value to a bank located in the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of RA 11212, the expropriation proceedings must continue. Consistent with the constitutional requirement for the payment of just compensation in case of taking of a private property for public use, Section 10 of RA 11212 expressly provides for the need to pay just compensation to the owner deprived of property/ies. Thus, in the event of a finding by the trial court that MORE has a lawful right to take the specific property/ies of PECO, MORE must still pay PECO just compensation based on the court's determination coupled with legal interest thereon from the time of taking of the property/ies. [24]\n\nAll told, I find that the delegation of the power of eminent domain to MORE under Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 is for a public use and does not constitute d privation of property without due process of law.\n\nGiven the foregoing, I concur with the ponencia and vote to DENY the motion for reconsideration.\n\n[1] MORE Electric and Power Corporation v.

Rep. of the Phils., supra note 18 at 1064.\n\nDISSENTING OPINION\n\nDELOS SANTOS, J .:\n\nUpon careful review of the merits of the present Motion for Reconsideration and with the indulgence of my colleagues, the honorable Members of the Court, I most respectfully change my vote from the 15 September 2020 Decision of the Court and join the dissenting opinion of Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen (Justice Leonen). Considering the substantive arguments raised in the Motion for Reconsideration, I agree with Justice Leonen that Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. (RA) 11212 [1] must be struck down by the Court as unconstitutional. The said provisions are clearly beyond the scope of the State's power of eminent domain. Glaringly, the taking of respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (PECO) assets by petitioner More Electric Power Corporation (MORE) through the State's power of eminent domain effectively amounts to the taking of private property not for a public purpose but for private gain.\n\nRA 11212 granted petitioner MORE a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. Section 10 of RA 11212 provides for the exercise of the right of eminent domain in favor of MORE, to wit:\n\nSection 10. Right of Eminent Domain . \u2013 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided , That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:\n\nProvided, further , That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.\n\nThe ponencia claims that Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 constitutes a valid exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. The ponencia reasons that the general consideration of public use is \"whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare.\" As applied in the present case, the ponencia posits that the law is undoubtedly for the general purpose of electricity distribution and, thus, satisfies the requirement of public use. Moreover, the ponencia reasons that Sections 10 and 17 ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition period from the old to the new franchisee, from PECO to MORE, respectively.\n\nI most respectfully disagree.\n\nSection 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution states:\n\nSection 9. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation . (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nThe power of eminent domain is an inherent power of the State. The power gives the State the authority to forcibly take private property provided the taking of private property is: (1) for a public purpose ; and (2) upon payment of just compensation. [2] In a long line of cases, the Court has consistently held that the power of eminent domain must be solely or exclusively exercised for a public purpose . Section 9, Article III, thus, acts as a restraint on the State's expansive power of eminent domain . [3] In Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment , [4] the Court held that property due process undoubtedly involves the promotion of stability of ownership over private property. [5] Verily, without such restrictions on the State's power of eminent domain, the State could then arbitrarily confiscate privately-owned property without due process.\n\nRevisiting Justice Leonen's dissenting opinion in the 15 September 2020 Decision of the Court, he cited the evolving definition of \"public use,\" in the wise:\n\nIn its traditional and literal sense \"public use\" means \"public employment or the actual use by the public.\" There is no question that the taking of private property for the building of roads, schools, or hospitals for the use of the public falls under this notion of actual use. \"Public use,\" however, evolved to mean \"public purpose,\" \"public advantage or benefit,\" and even \"public welfare.\" It is under this expanded meaning of public use that expropriations for agrarian reform and urban development were allowed by this Court.\n\nx x x x\n\nIt is settled that the business of electricity distribution is for a public purpose and is imbued with public interest. It is for this reason that the operation of an electricity distribution system requires a national franchise from Congress.\n\nHowever, if the private property is taken for the same public use as to which the property was originally devoted, how the expropriator will serve the public purpose better than the former owner should be examined. For if the public is not better off with the taking of the property, then there is no true expropriation. There is only transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change in the \"application of profits,\" directly serving proprietary interests. Any public benefit is only pretended or, at best, incidental. [6] (Emphasis supplied)\n\nLikewise, in Justice Leonen's dissenting opinion in the Motion for Reconsideration brought before the Court, he reiterates his position and cites the Court's Decision in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government [7] in that true expropriation implies a new public purpose, to wit:\n\nNevertheless, if property is taken for the same public use to which it was originally devoted, there is no true expropriation. As early as 1921, this Court in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government noted how the meaning of the term 'public use' [is] one of constant growth and that [a]s society advances, its demands upon the individual increase and each demand is a new use to which the resources of the individual may be devoted . This implies that a true expropriation requires a new public use.\n\nIndeed, if property is taken then subsequently devoted to the same public use, there is only a transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change as to who gets the profits. Therefore, the taking primarily serves proprietary interests, with little if no regard as to the interests of the public. Any public interest is only pretended or, at best, incidental. [8]\n\nIn relation to the term \"public use,\" the Court must be guided by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's dissenting opinion in Kelo v. The City of New London . [9] In her strong dissent, Justice O'Connor explained the dangerous precedent the US Supreme Court may cause if the US Court would expand the definition of \"public use\" to accommodate private interests, to wit:\n\nIn moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use. It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public \u2013 such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure. But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words \"for public use\" do not realistically exclude any takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.\n\nThere is a sense in which this troubling result follows from errant language in Berman and Midkiff . In discussing whether takings within a blighted neighborhood were for a public use, Berman began by observing: \"We deal, in other words, with what traditionally has been known as the police power.\" 348 U.S., at 32. From there it declared that \"[o]nce the object is within the authority of Congress, the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear.\" Id. , at 33. Following up, we said in Midkiff that \"[t]he 'public use' requirement is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.\" 467 U.S., at 240. This language was unnecessary to the specific holdings of those decisions. Berman and Midkiff simply did not put such language to the constitutional test, because the takings in those cases were within the police power but also for \"public use\" for the reasons I have described. The case before us now demonstrates why, when deciding if a taking's purpose is constitutional, the police power and \"public use\" cannot always be equated. [10] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nIn the present case, upon careful review of PECO's Motion for Reconsideration, I find that the taking of PECO's property does not amount to a legitimate public purpose and, hence, is not a proper subject of the exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. Firstly , under the facts presented, MORE has no basic qualifications, much less experience, in electricity distribution. Secondly , MORE clearly does not have assets of its own. MORE will undoubtedly depend on the transfer of PECO's assets to create an electricity distribution system. In fact, during the Congressional debates on MORE's franchise application, the Lower House conceded that MORE will solely rely on PECO's assets for the effective distribution of electricity in Iloilo City. Thirdly , the taking of PECO's private property will undoubtedly foster a monopoly in the electricity distribution system in Iloilo City. Fourthly , the taking of PECO's assets ipso facto amounts to the transfer of property from one entity to another and a mere appropriation of profits, directly serving MORE's proprietary interests . Fifth , there is no direct public good that can be derived from the exercise of the power of eminent domain . The benefit or welfare of the people is only incidental to the exercise of the power. The sole primary benefactor remains to be MORE. Sixth , the mere fact that Sections 10 and 1 7 ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City during the transition period from PECO to MORE should not be honored as strong evidence of public use. The flawed reasoning suggests that as long as there is no interruption in the service of electricity then the exercise of the power of eminent domain could be justified. In addition, such statement cannot be guaranteed by the Court since it has been established that MORE has no experience whatsoever in electricity distribution. To repeat, incidental public benefit cannot justify the exercise of the State's power of eminent domain.\n\nAll things considered, the Court has the primordial duty to abolish laws passed by the legislative that amount to the taking of property exclusively for private gain or laws that promote the facilitation of a monopolistic system. Conceivably, it will be the Filipino people who will bear the brunt of these arbitrary and confiscatory laws like Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212. Ultimately, to uphold the validity of Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 is to sanction a clear violation of the 1987 Constitution, PECO's rights to property due process, and the people of Iloilo City's right to the efficient and effective access to proper electricity distribution.\n\nACCORDINGLY , I vote to DECLARE Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 as unconstitutional.\n\n[1] An Act Granting More Electric and Power Corporation a Franchise to Establish, Operate, and Maintain, for Commercial Purposes and in the Public Interest, a Distribution System for the Conveyance of Electric Power to the End Users in the City of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, and Ensuring the Continuous and Uninterrupted Supply of Electricity in the Franchise Area; approved on February 14, 2019.\n\n[2] Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority v.

      "title": "GENOVEVA S. SUAREZ, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CARANDANG, J.: Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated November 19, 2019 and Resolution dated September 1, 2020 rendered by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Crim. Case No. 066, which affirmed the conviction of Genoveva S. Suarez (petitioner), as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century Entertainment, Inc. (21st Century), for violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or the failure of 21st Century to pay its tax liabilities.Facts of the CaseOn August 21, 2008, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila filed an Information against petitioner for violation of Section 255, in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC, committed as follows:That on or about January 23, 2004, and continuously up to present, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused being then the President of 21st CENTURY ENTERTAINMENT, INC. with business address at Room 207 Tiaoqui Bldg., Sta. Cruz, Manila, and therefore the responsible officer of the said Corporation, to whom notices and demands were made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, represented in this case by ATTY. HABARI LUCMAN BALT, to pay the Corporation's overdue tax obligations amounting to PhP747,964.49 under BIR Assessment Notice No. 31-2000, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly fail, refuse and neglect to pay the Bureau of Internal Revenue the said amount of PhP747,964.49 despite due notice and demand without formally protesting and appealing the same with the proper authority, to the damage and prejudice of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines sin (sic) the same sum of PhP747,964.49, Philippine currency.CONTRARY TO LAW.[3]On February 4, 2009, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. During pre-trial, the prosecution and defense stipulated that petitioner is the Executive Vice-President of 21st Century at the time of the assessment.[4]As culled from the records of this case, the facts are as follows:On January 23, 2004, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued Final Assessment Notices (FANs) and Final Letters of Demand (FLDs) to 21st Century, demanding payment for deficiency income tax, improperly accumulated earnings tax, minimum corporate income tax, expanded withholding tax, value-added tax, and compromise penalty, in the aggregate amount of P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000.[5]On February 26, 2004, 21st Century, represented by its Vice-President, John S. Suarez, filed a Protest against the FLDs and requested the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for reinvestigation of the assessment issued against it. However, on December 5, 2005, the case docket of 21st Century was forwarded to the Chief Collection Division, for collection of the deficiency taxes because of 21st Century's failure to submit within 60 days from date of protest supporting documents to refute the assessment.[6]On December 19, 2005, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) issued the First Notice of Delinquent Account to 21st Century requiring it to settle its tax deficiencies. The RDO warned 21st Century that in case of failure to settle its tax obligations, the case shall be referred to the BIR legal division for appropriate action. On January 3, 2006, the RDO issued a Second Notice of Delinquent Account against 21st Century, informing the latter that the case has been referred to the BIR Legal Division. The RDO likewise reiterated that 21st Century should pay its tax deficiencies to avoid the issuance of a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDL) or Garnishment. Despite the foregoing notices, 21st Century still failed to settle its obligations; hence, on March 17, 2006, the BIR issued a Final Notice before Seizure addressed to Richard Suarez.[7]On August 24, 2006, in a bid to prevent the seizure of 2st Century's properties, petitioner sent a Letter to the RDO requesting additional time to secure the services of an external accountant to assist 21st Century in organizing its accounting records so that it could provide the BIR evidence supporting its financial statements and income tax returns Petitioner also expressed her willingness to settle 21st Century's tax liabilities, through compromise.[8] Despite this, the CIR, on November 28, 2006, issued a WDL against 21st Century.[9]On March 7, 2007, the BIR issued a Warrant of Garnishment to Equitable-PCI Bank against the account of 21st Century, to no avail. Hence, on May 28, 2007, the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities.[10]During the trial, the prosecution presented Ma. Paz Arcilla (Arcilla), Armando Macatangay (Macatangay) and Dionisio Singson (Singson) as its witnesses.Arcilla, a revenue officer of the BIR, testified that she supervises the preparation, issuance, and monitoring of demand letters, final assessments, and transcripts of assessments of tax cases. According to her, the original copies of the assessment notices and formal letters of demand were sent to the registered address of 21st Century and the same were duly received by 21st Century as evidenced by their filing of a protest letter to the FAN.[11]Macatangay testified that he was the mailing custodian of the administrative division of the BIR. He caused the mailing of the assessment notices and other formal demand letters to 21st Century.[12]Singson, on the other hand, stated that he was the revenue officer-seizure agent of the BIR in charge with the collection of the tax liabilities of 21st Century. According to Singson, he prepared the First, Second, and Final Notices for 21st Century to pay its tax liabilities but the latter failed to respond to all the notices. Subsequently, Singson prepared a Warrant of Levy and Distraint as well as a Warrant of Garnishment against 21st Century.[13]After offer of evidence, the prosecution rested its case.On April 7, 2016, petitioner filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence. However the motion was denied on April 14, 2016, for having been filed out of time. On the same date, petitioner waived presentation of evidence for her defense.[14]Ruling of the Regional Trial CourtOn June 2, 2016, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 21, rendered its Decision[15] finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC. The RTC likewise ordered petitioner to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century.[16]The RTC was convinced that the prosecution clearly established the criminal and civil liabilities of petitioner taking into consideration the testimonial and documentary evidence presented by the prosecution.[17]According to the RTC, the prosecution was able to prove that 21st Century failed to pay its overdue tax obligations amounting to P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000 as evidenced by the FANs and FLDs duly served to it. The RTC likewise held that petitioner is 21st Century's responsible officer who may be held criminally liable for violation of the provisions of the NIRC. The RTC emphasized that petitioner judicially admitted being the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of assessment and petitioner even signed and issued a Reply Letter dated August 24, 2006 admitting that 21st Century's tax case has become a delinquent account and requesting for a reasonable time to pay their tax liabilities by way of compromise agreement.[18]Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA.Ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals in DivisionOn July 5, 2018, the CTA in Division issued its Decision[19] affirming the conviction of petitioner. However, the CTA in Division deleted the RTC's order for petitioner to pay the tax liabilities. Instead, it was 21st Century that was ordered to be civilly liable for the unpaid taxes.[20]The CTA in Division agreed with the RTC that all the elements of failure to pay taxes were present in this case. According to the CTA in Division, the prosecution's testimonial and documentary evidence amply proved that 21st Century, as the corporate taxpayer, failed to pay its tax liabilities despite demand.[21] The CTA in Division further held that the second element of failure to pay taxes was present in this case since petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of assessment, is the responsible officer thereof. The CTA in Division found that petitioner's letter to the BIR, on behalf of 21st Century, asking for the extension to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century and expressing her intent to settle the tax liabilities through compromise, proved her position as a responsible officer of 21st Century.[22] Lastly, the CTA in Division concluded that 21st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities was willful. The CTA in Division emphasized that despite knowing about 21st Century's tax liabilities and despite the numerous chances given to it to pay such liabilities, petitioner, as the responsible officer of 21st Century, still failed to pay the same.[23]Petitioner moved for reconsideration but her motion was denied in a Resolution[24] dated February 20, 2019. Insisting on her innocence, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA En Banc.Ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals En BancOn November 19, 2019, the CTA En Banc affirmed the ruling of the CTA in Division.[25]For the CTA En Banc, it was undisputed that 21st Century is required by the NIRC to pay its taxes and that 21st Century failed to pay the same.[26] The CTA En Banc agreed with the conclusion of the CTA in Division that petitioner was a responsible officer of 21st Century who may properly be made liable for failure to pay taxes. The CTA En Banc took note of petitioner's judicial admission that she was the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of the assessment and that she even sent a Letter to the BIR to request extension of payment of the liabilities and expressed her willingness to enter into a compromise with the BIR. These acts, for the CTA En Banc, pointed to no other conclusion than that petitioner was in charge of settling 21st Century's tax liabilities. Therefore, a responsible officer thereof in so far as the provisions of the NIRC on failure to pay taxes are concerned.[27]Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration. However, the motion was denied in a Resolution dated September 1, 2020.Undaunted, petitioner filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari[28] and Supplemental Petition.[29] Petitioner argues that the CTA should not have ordered 21st Century civilly liable for the tax liabilities as the latter was already dropped from the case as early as the trial before the RTC.[30] Petitioner also claims that the alleged tax deficiencies of 21st Century was not proven because no Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) was ever issued to the latter.[31] Lastly, petitioner insists that she is not a responsible officer of 21st Century who may be held criminally liable for failure to pay taxes.[32]In its Comment,[33] the People of the Philippines and the BIR, through the Office of the Solicitor General, reiterate that petitioner's criminal and civil liabilities were duly proven by the prosecution.[34]IssueThe issue in this case is whether petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21st Century, may be held criminally liable for 21st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities.Ruling of the CourtThe petition is meritorious.Before delving into the substantive aspect of this case, the Court shall first deal with procedural matters.The determination of the guilt of an accused hinges on how a court appreciates evidentiary matters in relation to the requisites of an offense. Determination of guilt is, thus, a fundamentally factual issue.[35] The Court is not a trier of facts. Petitioner's Rule 45 petition should therefore only raise questions of law and not of facts. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, the Court will recalibrate and evaluate factual findings of the trial courts.[36]In this case, the Court finds the need to reassess the finding of the RTC and CTA on petitioner's guilt.Having discussed the procedural issue, the Court now focuses on the substantive aspect of the case.The provisions of the NIRC relevant to this case are as follows:Section 255. Failure to File Return, Supply Correct and Accurate Information, Pay Tax Withheld and Remit Tax and Refund Excess Taxes Withheld on Compensation. - Any person required under this Code or by rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct the accurate information, who willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than ten (10) years.Any person who attempts to make it appear for any reason that he or another has in fact filed a return or statement, or actually files a return or statement and subsequently withdraws the same return or statement after securing the official receiving seal or stamp of receipt of internal revenue office wherein the same was actually filed shall, upon conviction therefore, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) but not more than Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than three (3) years.Section 253. General Provisions. \u2013x x x x(d) In the case of associations, partnerships or corporations, the penalty shall be imposed on the partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.x x x xSection 256. Penal Liability of Corporations. \u2013 Any corporation, association or general co-partnership liable for any of the acts or omissions penalized under this Code, in addition to the penalties imposed herein upon the responsible corporate officers, partners, or employees shall, upon conviction for each act or omission, be punished by a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) but not more than One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000).As discussed by the CTA En Banc in the assailed decision, the following elements must be established by the prosecution to secure the conviction of petitioner in this case, to wit:(1) That a corporate taxpayer is required under the NIRC to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct and accurate information;(2) That the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the required tax, make a return or keep the required record, or supply the correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and(3) That accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply such correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations.[37]There is no dispute about the presence of the first and second elements. It is the third element \u2013 whether petitioner is a \"responsible officer\" of 21st Century who may be indicted and convicted of failure to pay taxes and who willfully failed to pay such taxes \u2013 that is contentious.As stipulated by both parties during the pre-trial and therefore conclusive as to them, petitioner was the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of the assessment. Section 253 of the NIRC expressly identified the following corporate officers who may be held liable for violations of the NIRC committed by the corporation: partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.Obviously, as an Executive Vice President, petitioner is not one of the corporate officers enumerated under the NIRC. However, the RTC and the CTA were convinced that petitioner falls under the category of employees responsible for the violation because of petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century, and signifying her intent, as representative of 21st Century, to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise. The RTC and the CTA concluded that this act is indicative of petitioner's significant role in the management of the affairs of 21st Century, and therefore, liable for the corporation's violation of the NIRC.The Court is not convinced.A corporation is an artificial being created by fiction of law.[38] By the corporation's nature as an abstract being, it cannot be arrested and imprisoned; hence, it cannot be penalized for a crime punishable by imprisonment.[39] As early as 1930 in the case of People v. Tan Boon Kong,[40] the Court already held that for crimes committed by a corporation, the responsible officers thereof would personally bear the criminal liability. This is because a corporation can act only through its officers and agents.In Ching v. Secretary of Justice[41] (Ching), the Court upheld the finding of probable cause and the filing of Informations for violation of Presidential Decree No. 115 or the Trust Receipts Law against petitioner Ching as the one who signed the trust receipts, on behalf of the corporation.In Ching, the Court had the occasion to discuss the liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation as follows:A crime is the doing of that which the penal code forbids to be done, or omitting to do what it commands. A necessary part of the definition of every crime is the designation of the author of the crime upon whom the penalty is to be inflicted. When a criminal statute designates an act of a corporation or a crime and prescribes punishment therefor, it creates a criminal offense which, otherwise, would not exist and such can be committed only by the corporation. But when a penal statute does not expressly apply to corporations, it does not create an offense for which a corporation may be punished. On the other hand, if the State, by statute, defines a crime that may be committed by a corporation but prescribes the penalty therefor to be suffered by the officers, directors, or employees of such corporation or other persons responsible for the offense, only such individuals will suffer such penalty. Corporate officers or employees, through whose act, default or omission the corporation commits a crime, are themselves individually guilty of the crime.The principle applies whether or not the crime requires the consciousness of wrongdoing. It applies to those corporate agents who themselves commit the crime and to those, who, by virtue of their managerial positions or other similar relation to the corporation, could be deemed responsible for its commission, if by virtue of their relationship to the corporation, they had the power to prevent the act. Moreover, all parties active in promoting a crime, whether agents or not, are principals. Whether such officers or employees are benefited by their delictual acts is not a touchstone of their criminal liability. Benefit is not an operative fact.[42]In ABS-CBN v. Gozon (ABS-CBN),[43] the Court discussed that although corporate officers may be held liable for a crime committed under the Intellectual Property Code, their criminal liability stems from their active participation in the commission of the wrongful act. Hence, in ABS-CBN, the Court affirmed the finding of probable cause against two of GMA's executives for copyright infringement of ABS-CBN's news footage because of their position as Head of News Operations and Program Manager. However, the Court excluded from the filing of Information other GMA corporate officers because:Mere membership of the Board or being President per se does not mean knowledge, approval, and participation in the act alleged as criminal. There must be a showing of active participation, not simply a constructive one.[44]This same doctrine was reiterated in SEC v. Price Richardson Corporation[45] where the Court stated that to be criminally liable for the acts of a corporation, there must be a showing that its officers, directors, and shareholders actively participated in or had the power to prevent the wrongful act.In this case, petitioner's position as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century will not per se make her liable for the failure of 21st Century to pay its tax liabilities. In the words of Section 253 of the NIRC, petitioner must have been the employee or officer responsible for the violation.Contrary to the conclusion arrived at by the RTC and CTA, petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century, and signifying her intent as representative of 21st Century to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise, is not enough to pronounce her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This single Letter does not suffice to prove that petitioner has actively participated in, or has failed to prevent the violation by 21st Century of the provisions of the NIRC.As pointed out by petitioner, the prosecution, which has the burden of proving petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, failed to introduce any evidence that would show that petitioner's duties and responsibilities as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century allowed her to participate in 21st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities. The records of the case is bereft of any evidence showing that petitioner's acts and omissions caused 21st Century to violate the provisions of the NIRC. The prosecution neither proved that it is within petitioner's power as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century to prevent any such violation. Absent proof that petitioner had any direct and active participation in the non-payment of 21st Century's tax liabilities, the Court cannot convict her of violation of the provisions of the NIRC.On another note, it cannot be said that petitioner's Letter to the BIR, expressing her willingness to settle 21st Century's tax liabilities through compromise, may be received in evidence as an implied admission of her guilt pursuant to Section 28 of Rule 130 of the 2019 Amendment to the Revised Rules on Evidence[46]. The same Rule provides for exceptions, such that, in criminal cases, an offer of compromise for those involving quasi-offenses (criminal negligence) and those allowed by law to be compromised, cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of the accused's guilt.Section 204 of the NIRC,[47] which provides authority to the CIR to, among others, enter into a compromise with taxpayers, explicitly states that \"[a]ll criminal violations [of the NIRC] may be compromised except: (a) those already filed in court, or (b) those involving fraud.\" Thus, the NIRC itself allows compromise even for violations of its penal provisions.Further, in San Miguel Corporation v. Kalalo[48] involving a criminal case for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, the Court held that the accused's act of sending the Offer of Compromise prior to the filing of the criminal complaint was not made in the context of a criminal proceeding, and therefore, cannot be considered as an implied admission of guilt. Here, petitioner's alleged letter to the RDO expressing her willingness to settle the tax liabilities of 21st Century was sent on August 24, 2006. It was only on May 28, 2007 that the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities, while the Information was only filed on August 21, 2008 by the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila. Thus, petitioner's offer of compromise cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt.In criminal cases, the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. If there exists even one iota of doubt, this Court is under a longstanding legal injunction to resolve the doubt in favor of the accused.[49]WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARANDANG, J.:\n\nBefore this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari [1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision [2] dated November 19, 2019 and Resolution dated September 1, 2020 rendered by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Crim. Case No. 066, which affirmed the conviction of Genoveva S. Suarez (petitioner), as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century Entertainment, Inc. (21 st Century), for violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or the failure of 21 st Century to pay its tax liabilities.\n\nFacts of the Case\nOn August 21, 2008, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila filed an Information against petitioner for violation of Section 255, in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC, committed as follows:\nThat on or about January 23, 2004, and continuously up to present, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused being then the President of 21 st CENTURY ENTERTAINMENT, INC. with business address at Room 207 Tiaoqui Bldg., Sta. Cruz, Manila, and therefore the responsible officer of the said Corporation, to whom notices and demands were made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, represented in this case by ATTY. HABARI LUCMAN BALT, to pay the Corporation's overdue tax obligations amounting to PhP747,964.49 under BIR Assessment Notice No. 31-2000, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly fail, refuse and neglect to pay the Bureau of Internal Revenue the said amount of PhP747,964.49 despite due notice and demand without formally protesting and appealing the same with the proper authority, to the damage and prejudice of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines sin (sic) the same sum of PhP747,964.49, Philippine currency.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [3] On February 4, 2009, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. During pre-trial, the prosecution and defense stipulated that petitioner is the Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century at the time of the assessment. [4]\n\nAs culled from the records of this case, the facts are as follows:\n\nOn January 23, 2004, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued Final Assessment Notices (FANs) and Final Letters of Demand (FLDs) to 21 st Century, demanding payment for deficiency income tax, improperly accumulated earnings tax, minimum corporate income tax, expanded withholding tax, value-added tax, and compromise penalty, in the aggregate amount of P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000. [5]\n\nOn February 26, 2004, 21 st Century, represented by its Vice-President, John S. Suarez, filed a Protest against the FLDs and requested the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for reinvestigation of the assessment issued against it. However, on December 5, 2005, the case docket of 21 st Century was forwarded to the Chief Collection Division, for collection of the deficiency taxes because of 21 st Century's failure to submit within 60 days from date of protest supporting documents to refute the assessment. [6]\n\nOn December 19, 2005, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) issued the First Notice of Delinquent Account to 21 st Century requiring it to settle its tax deficiencies. The RDO warned 21 st Century that in case of failure to settle its tax obligations, the case shall be referred to the BIR legal division for appropriate action. On January 3, 2006, the RDO issued a Second Notice of Delinquent Account against 21 st Century, informing the latter that the case has been referred to the BIR Legal Division. The RDO likewise reiterated that 21 st Century should pay its tax deficiencies to avoid the issuance of a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDL) or Garnishment. Despite the foregoing notices, 21 st Century still failed to settle its obligations; hence, on March 17, 2006, the BIR issued a Final Notice before Seizure addressed to Richard Suarez. [7]\n\nOn August 24, 2006, in a bid to prevent the seizure of 2 st Century's properties, petitioner sent a Letter to the RDO requesting additional time to secure the services of an external accountant to assist 21 st Century in organizing its accounting records so that it could provide the BIR evidence supporting its financial statements and income tax returns Petitioner also expressed her willingness to settle 21 st Century's tax liabilities, through compromise. [8] Despite this, the CIR, on November 28, 2006, issued a WDL against 21 st Century. [9]\n\nOn March 7, 2007, the BIR issued a Warrant of Garnishment to Equitable-PCI Bank against the account of 21 st Century, to no avail. Hence, on May 28, 2007, the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21 st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities. [10]\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution presented Ma. Paz Arcilla (Arcilla), Armando Macatangay (Macatangay) and Dionisio Singson (Singson) as its witnesses.\n\nArcilla, a revenue officer of the BIR, testified that she supervises the preparation, issuance, and monitoring of demand letters, final assessments, and transcripts of assessments of tax cases. According to her, the original copies of the assessment notices and formal letters of demand were sent to the registered address of 21 st Century and the same were duly received by 21 st Century as evidenced by their filing of a protest letter to the FAN. [11]\n\nMacatangay testified that he was the mailing custodian of the administrative division of the BIR. He caused the mailing of the assessment notices and other formal demand letters to 21 st Century. [12]\n\nSingson, on the other hand, stated that he was the revenue officer-seizure agent of the BIR in charge with the collection of the tax liabilities of 21 st Century. According to Singson, he prepared the First, Second, and Final Notices for 21 st Century to pay its tax liabilities but the latter failed to respond to all the notices. Subsequently, Singson prepared a Warrant of Levy and Distraint as well as a Warrant of Garnishment against 21 st Century. [13]\n\nAfter offer of evidence, the prosecution rested its case.\n\nOn April 7, 2016, petitioner filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence. However the motion was denied on April 14, 2016, for having been filed out of time. On the same date, petitioner waived presentation of evidence for her defense. [14]\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\nOn June 2, 2016, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 21, rendered its Decision [15] finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC. The RTC likewise ordered petitioner to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century. [16]\n\nThe RTC was convinced that the prosecution clearly established the criminal and civil liabilities of petitioner taking into consideration the testimonial and documentary evidence presented by the prosecution. [17]\n\nAccording to the RTC, the prosecution was able to prove that 21 st Century failed to pay its overdue tax obligations amounting to P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000 as evidenced by the FANs and FLDs duly served to it. The RTC likewise held that petitioner is 21 st Century's responsible officer who may be held criminally liable for violation of the provisions of the NIRC. The RTC emphasized that petitioner judicially admitted being the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of assessment and petitioner even signed and issued a Reply Letter dated August 24, 2006 admitting that 21 st Century's tax case has become a delinquent account and requesting for a reasonable time to pay their tax liabilities by way of compromise agreement. [18]\n\nAggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA.\n\nRuling of the Court of Tax Appeals in Division\nOn July 5, 2018, the CTA in Division issued its Decision [19] affirming the conviction of petitioner. However, the CTA in Division deleted the RTC's order for petitioner to pay the tax liabilities. Instead, it was 21 st Century that was ordered to be civilly liable for the unpaid taxes. [20]\n\nThe CTA in Division agreed with the RTC that all the elements of failure to pay taxes were present in this case. According to the CTA in Division, the prosecution's testimonial and documentary evidence amply proved that 21 st Century, as the corporate taxpayer, failed to pay its tax liabilities despite demand. [21] The CTA in Division further held that the second element of failure to pay taxes was present in this case since petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of assessment, is the responsible officer thereof. The CTA in Division found that petitioner's letter to the BIR, on behalf of 21 st Century, asking for the extension to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century and expressing her intent to settle the tax liabilities through compromise, proved her position as a responsible officer of 21 st Century. [22] Lastly, the CTA in Division concluded that 21 st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities was willful. The CTA in Division emphasized that despite knowing about 21 st Century's tax liabilities and despite the numerous chances given to it to pay such liabilities, petitioner, as the responsible officer of 21 st Century, still failed to pay the same. [23]\n\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration but her motion was denied in a Resolution [24] dated February 20, 2019. Insisting on her innocence, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA En Banc.\n\nRuling of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc\nOn November 19, 2019, the CTA En Banc affirmed the ruling of the CTA in Division. [25]\n\nFor the CTA En Banc, it was undisputed that 21 st Century is required by the NIRC to pay its taxes and that 21 st Century failed to pay the same. [26] The CTA En Banc agreed with the conclusion of the CTA in Division that petitioner was a responsible officer of 21 st Century who may properly be made liable for failure to pay taxes. The CTA En Banc took note of petitioner's judicial admission that she was the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of the assessment and that she even sent a Letter to the BIR to request extension of payment of the liabilities and expressed her willingness to enter into a compromise with the BIR. These acts, for the CTA En Banc, pointed to no other conclusion than that petitioner was in charge of settling 21 st Century's tax liabilities. Therefore, a responsible officer thereof in so far as the provisions of the NIRC on failure to pay taxes are concerned. [27]\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration. However, the motion was denied in a Resolution dated September 1, 2020.\n\nUndaunted, petitioner filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari [28] and Supplemental Petition. [29] Petitioner argues that the CTA should not have ordered 21 st Century civilly liable for the tax liabilities as the latter was already dropped from the case as early as the trial before the RTC. [30] Petitioner also claims that the alleged tax deficiencies of 21 st Century was not proven because no Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) was ever issued to the latter. [31] Lastly, petitioner insists that she is not a responsible officer of 21 st Century who may be held criminally liable for failure to pay taxes. [32]\n\nIn its Comment, [33] the People of the Philippines and the BIR, through the Office of the Solicitor General, reiterate that petitioner's criminal and civil liabilities were duly proven by the prosecution. [34]\n\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century, may be held criminally liable for 21 st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities.\n\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nBefore delving into the substantive aspect of this case, the Court shall first deal with procedural matters.\n\nThe determination of the guilt of an accused hinges on how a court appreciates evidentiary matters in relation to the requisites of an offense. Determination of guilt is, thus, a fundamentally factual issue. [35] The Court is not a trier of facts. Petitioner's Rule 45 petition should therefore only raise questions of law and not of facts. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, the Court will recalibrate and evaluate factual findings of the trial courts. [36]\n\nIn this case, the Court finds the need to reassess the finding of the RTC and CTA on petitioner's guilt.\n\nHaving discussed the procedural issue, the Court now focuses on the substantive aspect of the case.\n\nThe provisions of the NIRC relevant to this case are as follows:\nSection 255. Failure to File Return, Supply Correct and Accurate Information, Pay Tax Withheld and Remit Tax and Refund Excess Taxes Withheld on Compensation. - Any person required under this Code or by rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct the accurate information, who willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than ten (10) years.\n\nAny person who attempts to make it appear for any reason that he or another has in fact filed a return or statement, or actually files a return or statement and subsequently withdraws the same return or statement after securing the official receiving seal or stamp of receipt of internal revenue office wherein the same was actually filed shall, upon conviction therefore, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) but not more than Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than three (3) years.\n\nSection 253. General Provisions. \u2013\n\nx x x x\n\n(d) In the case of associations, partnerships or corporations, the penalty shall be imposed on the partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.\n\nx x x x\n\nSection 256. Penal Liability of Corporations. \u2013 Any corporation, association or general co-partnership liable for any of the acts or omissions penalized under this Code, in addition to the penalties imposed herein upon the responsible corporate officers, partners, or employees shall, upon conviction for each act or omission, be punished by a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) but not more than One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000).\nAs discussed by the CTA En Banc in the assailed decision, the following elements must be established by the prosecution to secure the conviction of petitioner in this case, to wit:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | That a corporate taxpayer is required under the NIRC to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct and accurate information;\n(2) | That the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the required tax, make a return or keep the required record, or supply the correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and\n(3) | That accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply such correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations.[37]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) That a corporate taxpayer is required under the NIRC to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct and accurate information; (2) That the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the required tax, make a return or keep the required record, or supply the correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and (3) That accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply such correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations. [37] There is no dispute about the presence of the first and second elements. It is the third element \u2013 whether petitioner is a \"responsible officer\" of 21 st Century who may be indicted and convicted of failure to pay taxes and who willfully failed to pay such taxes \u2013 that is contentious.\n\nAs stipulated by both parties during the pre-trial and therefore conclusive as to them, petitioner was the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of the assessment. Section 253 of the NIRC expressly identified the following corporate officers who may be held liable for violations of the NIRC committed by the corporation: partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.\n\nObviously, as an Executive Vice President, petitioner is not one of the corporate officers enumerated under the NIRC. However, the RTC and the CTA were convinced that petitioner falls under the category of employees responsible for the violation because of petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century, and signifying her intent, as representative of 21 st Century, to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise. The RTC and the CTA concluded that this act is indicative of petitioner's significant role in the management of the affairs of 21 st Century, and therefore, liable for the corporation's violation of the NIRC.\n\nThe Court is not convinced.\n\nA corporation is an artificial being created by fiction of law. [38] By the corporation's nature as an abstract being, it cannot be arrested and imprisoned; hence, it cannot be penalized for a crime punishable by imprisonment. [39] As early as 1930 in the case of People v. Tan Boon Kong, [40] the Court already held that for crimes committed by a corporation, the responsible officers thereof would personally bear the criminal liability. This is because a corporation can act only through its officers and agents.\n\nIn Ching v. Secretary of Justice [41] ( Ching ), the Court upheld the finding of probable cause and the filing of Informations for violation of Presidential Decree No. 115 or the Trust Receipts Law against petitioner Ching as the one who signed the trust receipts, on behalf of the corporation.\n\nIn Ching, the Court had the occasion to discuss the liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation as follows:\nA crime is the doing of that which the penal code forbids to be done, or omitting to do what it commands. A necessary part of the definition of every crime is the designation of the author of the crime upon whom the penalty is to be inflicted. When a criminal statute designates an act of a corporation or a crime and prescribes punishment therefor, it creates a criminal offense which, otherwise, would not exist and such can be committed only by the corporation. But when a penal statute does not expressly apply to corporations, it does not create an offense for which a corporation may be punished. On the other hand, if the State, by statute, defines a crime that may be committed by a corporation but prescribes the penalty therefor to be suffered by the officers, directors, or employees of such corporation or other persons responsible for the offense, only such individuals will suffer such penalty. Corporate officers or employees, through whose act, default or omission the corporation commits a crime, are themselves individually guilty of the crime.\n\nThe principle applies whether or not the crime requires the consciousness of wrongdoing. It applies to those corporate agents who themselves commit the crime and to those, who, by virtue of their managerial positions or other similar relation to the corporation, could be deemed responsible for its commission, if by virtue of their relationship to the corporation, they had the power to prevent the act. Moreover, all parties active in promoting a crime, whether agents or not, are principals. Whether such officers or employees are benefited by their delictual acts is not a touchstone of their criminal liability. Benefit is not an operative fact. [42] In ABS-CBN v. Gozon (ABS-CBN), [43] the Court discussed that although corporate officers may be held liable for a crime committed under the Intellectual Property Code, their criminal liability stems from their active participation in the commission of the wrongful act. Hence, in ABS-CBN, the Court affirmed the finding of probable cause against two of GMA's executives for copyright infringement of ABS-CBN's news footage because of their position as Head of News Operations and Program Manager. However, the Court excluded from the filing of Information other GMA corporate officers because:\nMere membership of the Board or being President per se does not mean knowledge, approval, and participation in the act alleged as criminal. There must be a showing of active participation, not simply a constructive one. [44] This same doctrine was reiterated in SEC v. Price Richardson Corporation [45] where the Court stated that to be criminally liable for the acts of a corporation, there must be a showing that its officers, directors, and shareholders actively participated in or had the power to prevent the wrongful act.\n\nIn this case, petitioner's position as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century will not per se make her liable for the failure of 21 st Century to pay its tax liabilities. In the words of Section 253 of the NIRC, petitioner must have been the employee or officer responsible for the violation.\n\nContrary to the conclusion arrived at by the RTC and CTA, petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century, and signifying her intent as representative of 21 st Century to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise, is not enough to pronounce her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This single Letter does not suffice to prove that petitioner has actively participated in, or has failed to prevent the violation by 21 st Century of the provisions of the NIRC.\n\nAs pointed out by petitioner, the prosecution, which has the burden of proving petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, failed to introduce any evidence that would show that petitioner's duties and responsibilities as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century allowed her to participate in 21 st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities. The records of the case is bereft of any evidence showing that petitioner's acts and omissions caused 21 st Century to violate the provisions of the NIRC. The prosecution neither proved that it is within petitioner's power as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century to prevent any such violation. Absent proof that petitioner had any direct and active participation in the non-payment of 21 st Century's tax liabilities, the Court cannot convict her of violation of the provisions of the NIRC.\n\nOn another note, it cannot be said that petitioner's Letter to the BIR, expressing her willingness to settle 21 st Century's tax liabilities through compromise, may be received in evidence as an implied admission of her guilt pursuant to Section 28 of Rule 130 of the 2019 Amendment to the Revised Rules on Evidence [46] . The same Rule provides for exceptions, such that, in criminal cases, an offer of compromise for those involving quasi-offenses (criminal negligence) and those allowed by law to be compromised, cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of the accused's guilt.\n\nSection 204 of the NIRC, [47] which provides authority to the CIR to, among others, enter into a compromise with taxpayers, explicitly states that \"[a]ll criminal violations [of the NIRC] may be compromised except: (a) those already filed in court, or (b) those involving fraud.\" Thus, the NIRC itself allows compromise even for violations of its penal provisions.\n\nFurther, in San Miguel Corporation v. Kalalo [48] involving a criminal case for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, the Court held that the accused's act of sending the Offer of Compromise prior to the filing of the criminal complaint was not made in the context of a criminal proceeding, and therefore, cannot be considered as an implied admission of guilt. Here, petitioner's alleged letter to the RDO expressing her willingness to settle the tax liabilities of 21 st Century was sent on August 24, 2006. It was only on May 28, 2007 that the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21 st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities, while the Information was only filed on August 21, 2008 by the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila. Thus, petitioner's offer of compromise cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt.\n\nIn criminal cases, the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. If there exists even one iota of doubt, this Court is under a longstanding legal injunction to resolve the doubt in favor of the accused. [49]\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

LILAGAN, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 34, TACLOBAN CITY, LUDY C. MARMITA, SHERIFF IV, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 9, TACLOBAN CITY, ESTEBAN B. SACRAMENTO AND THE HEIRS OF SALVACION SIONY L. SACRAMENTO, RESPONDENTS.R E S O L U T I O N LOPEZ, M., J.: The doctrine of res judicata requires that stability be accorded to judgments lest there would be endless controversies. The relitigation of issues already settled burdens the courts and the taxpayers, creates uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be devoted to worthier causes.[1] We apply this policy in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals-Cebu City's (CA) Decision[3] dated April 30, 2015 in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 07675.ANTECEDENTSSpouses Esteban R. Sacramento and Salvacion Siony L. Sacramento (Spouses Sacramento) owned parcels of land situated in Barangay Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tacloban City which includes Lot No. 4144. The City Government of Tacloban, with authority from the Sangguniang Panlungsod, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for eminent domain over a portion of Lot No. 4144 for use as access road to the city's dumpsite.[4] On September 8, 2008, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement[5] with the following terms and conditions, to wit:NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby undertake as follows:(1) The FIRST PARTY shall pay unto the SECOND PARTIES the amount of TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]280.00), Philippine Currency, per square meter, as compensation for the acquisition of Lot No. 4144, with an area of about 49,057 sq. meters or a total amount of THIRTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY PESOS ([P]13,735,960.00), Philippine Currency, the lot being the subject of the above-captioned, under the following payment schedule:1.1) One-half (1/2) or the amount of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) to be paid after ratification of this Compromise Agreement by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban;1.2) The other half of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) shall be paid in two (2) equal installments in the amount of THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY PESOS ([P]3,433,990.00) in the succeeding two (2) quarters;(2) The SECOND PARTY shall pay all realty taxes, documentary stamp tax, capital gains tax, sales tax, transfer tax, registration fees, estate tax and other liabilities in connection with the land subject of the above-captioned case and the sale, transfer or conveyance of the same as well as all their obligations and obligations to other parties including those in favor of their lawyer;(3) The parties agree to, and shall cause, the dismissal, with prejudice, of the above-captioned case, including all claims and counterclaims therein, and agree not to file any similar case, whether civil, administrative or criminal, of any kind or nature whatsoever, arising from the same facts, incident, claim, cause or causes of action;(4) The parties hereby mutually, irrevocably, freely, and voluntarily release and forever discharge one another, from any and all manner of action, causes of action, sum of money, damages, liability, responsibility, obligation, claims and demands whatsoever in law or equity, which they had, now have, or may have against each other, including, but not limited to, actual, moral, exemplary and all other damages or causes of action provided for under the law if any, arising, directly or indirectly, from the facts and circumstances giving rise to, surrounding or arising from the complaint and/or counterclaims in the Pending Case, all of which claims or causes of action by these presents the parties hereby abandon and waive;(5) This agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission on the part of any party of any fault, negligence, or liability, of whatever kind and nature, in connection with the Pending Case;(6) That the parties hereto agree to declare the FIRST PARTY as the true, legal, and absolute owner of the property subject matter hereof;(7) In case of material breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the innocent party is hereby authorized to apply for a writ of execution in the Pending Case for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms and conditions of this agreement.[6] (Emphases in the original.) On September 18, 2008, the RTC, presided by Judge Rogelio C. Sescon (Judge Sescon) approved the Compromise Agreement and directed the parties to comply with its terms and conditions.[7] On September 24, 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified the agreement through Resolution No. 2008-10-530 stating: \"RESOLVE, as it is hereby resolved, to confirm/ratify the Compromise Agreement entered into by the Parties in Civil Case No. 2006-01-04 and duly approved by Hon. Rogelio C. Sescon, Presiding Judge, RTC Branch 9, Tacloban City dated September 18, 2008[.]\"[8] On November 19, 2008, however, the Sangguniang Panlungsod withdrew its ratification and issued Resolution No. 2008-10-581 entitled \"RESOLUTION WITHDRAWING/RESCINDING AND/OR REPEALING AND DECLARING AS NULL AND VOID RESOLUTION NO. 2008-10-530 PASSED AND APPROVED BY THIS HONORABLE BODY ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2008.\"[9]Meantime, Spouses Sacramento moved for the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On March 16, 2009, the RTC denied[10] the motion for execution in view of the withdrawal of the city council's ratification of the compromise agreement, viz.:This Court after going over the allegations of the parties, allegations, and counter-allegations in their subject motion and comments and/or oppositions and finding that the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban City had passed and approved Resolution No. 2008-10-[581] withdrawing/rescinding and declaring as null and void Resolution No. 2008-10-530 so that there is no more compromise agreement to speak of, finds the defendants' motion for execution of judgment to be devoid of merit, and therefore, this Court denies the same.SO ORDERED.[11] Spouses Sacramento filed a motion for reconsideration. On June 4, 2009, the RTC granted the motion,[12] and ordered the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On July 1, 2009, a Writ of Execution[13] was issued. Unsuccessful at a reconsideration,[14] the City Government of Tacloban elevated the case to the CA through a Petition for Certiorari[15] docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 04526. The City Government of Tacloban argued that public funds are not subject to levy and execution, and that the judgment based on a compromise agreement cannot be enforced without a valid ratification from the city council.[16]On June 22, 2011, the CA dismissed the petition for certiorari absent grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC,[17] thus:The parties' decision to enter into judicial compromise agreements to put an end to litigation is recognized in this jurisdiction. The court cannot impose a judgment different from the terms of a compromise agreement when such concurrence is not contrary to law, judicial decision, morals, good customs, or public policy. Once judicially approved, a compromise agreement becomes more than a binding contract to the parties and has the effect of res judicata. Just like any final judgment, \"the winning party is entitled to a writ of execution and the issuance thereof becomes a court's ministerial duty.\" The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that a judgment upon a compromise is immediately executory, where neither party moved to have it set aside on the ground of vices of consent or forgery.Before this Court, petitioner invoked Sangguniang Panglungsod's Resolution No. 2008-10-581 dated 19 November 2008, which rescinded its prior ratification of the subject Compromise Agreement because \"following the passage of [Resolution No. 2008-10-530], Hon. Ranulfo S. Abellanosa discovered that the subject land, Lot 4144, to be acquired from Spouses Esteban and Salvacion Sacramento exceeded greatly in area and price from what was authorized to the city mayor to acquire x x x\" and further cited grounds which make the enforcement of the issued writ of execution invalid due to lack of enabling laws.Unfortunately for petitioner, it can no longer impugn the validity of the Writ of Execution of 18 September 2008 which was issued out of public respondent's [fulfillment] of a ministerial duty. A final judgment is a vested right, which is protected by law. Certainly, \"a party upon whose initiative an agreement was made, on the basis of which the court rendered judgment, is estopped to question the propriety of the action of the court, in the absence of showing that his consent to the agreement was secured through fraud, which at any rate could not possibly exist, the agreement being of his own making.\"[18] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) The CA's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 lapsed into finality. On February 23, 2012, the CA issued an entry of judgment. Later, Spouses Sacramento moved before the RTC to direct the City Government of Tacloban to comply with the compromise agreement. On June 23, 2011, the RTC granted the motion and issued the corresponding alias writ of execution, and notices of attachment and levy.[19] Undaunted, the City Government of Tacloban moved to quash the writ of execution and to lift the notices of attachment and levy. On October 24, 2011, the RTC granted the motion.[20]Dissatisfied, Spouses Sacramento sought reconsideration but was denied. Thereafter, Judge Sescon inhibited and the case was transferred to Judge Frisco T. Lilagan (Judge Lilagan). Spouses Sacramento, again, moved for the issuance an alias writ of execution. On November 28, 2012, the RTC ruled that an alias writ is no longer necessary and ordered to continue the enforcement of the writ of execution issued on July 1, 2009,[21] to wit:First: This Court just like the original Court, being merely Regional Trial Courts, cannot modify, defy, violate, or much less reverse the Decision of the Honorable Court of Appeals affirming the validity and legality of the Writ of Execution which the original Court issued. It must be stressed that this Decision of the Court of Appeals had already attained its finality without the said Decision having been appealed.x x x xIt must be remembered that the Decision in this case is by reason of a Compromise Agreement, and a Compromise Agreement once approved by the Court becomes immediately final and executory. The Order approving the Compromise Agreement was issued on September 18, 2008. Legally and technically, therefore, the Writ of Execution issued to enforce the Compromise Agreement is still valid and subsisting. It is in this regard that this Court finds it unnecessary to issue an Alias Writ of Execution, instead to order the herein executing Sheriff, Sheriff IV LUDY C. MARMITA to execute and enforce the said Writ of Execution dated July 1, 2009 already issued and to make a return thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Court.[22] (Emphasis supplied.) Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, the City Government of Tacloban, again, elevated the case to the CA through a petition for review on certiorari docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 07675.[23] The City Government of Tacloban posited that Judge Lilagan erred in implementing the writ of execution which a co-equal court had quashed and lifted.[24] On April 30, 2015, the CA dismissed the petition on the ground of res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment, viz:The elements of res judicata under the concept of conclusiveness of judgment are:Identity of parties; andSubject matter in the first and second cases.The presence of the first element is not disputed considering that the parties in G.R. SP No. 04526 and in this case are similar. Also attendant is the last element, identity of the subject matter or the issue. A perusal of the allegations in the present case evidently shows that the petitioner mentioned issues similarly raised and already resolved in G.R. SP No. 04526. It must be emphasized that the order assailed in the present case is just enforcing the Writ of Execution issued on July 1, 2009 which was already passed upon in G.R. SP No. 04526.[25] Hence, this petition.[26] The City Government of Tacloban insists that the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 are different. In CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, the question is whether Judge Sescon committed grave abuse of discretion in enforcing the compromise agreement. On the other hand, the issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is whether Judge Lilagan was correct in implementing the previously quashed writ of execution dated July 1, 2009.[27]RULINGThe petition is unmeritorious.It bears emphasis that a compromise agreement is in the nature of both a contract and a judgment on the merits.[28] As a contract, the compromise agreement can only be avoided on grounds of illegality, lack of consent, fraud or duress.[29] In this case, Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban freely and voluntarily entered into a compromise agreement. The terms and conditions of the agreement are likewise clear. Moreover, the RTC approved the agreement and the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified it. The parties knew exactly the rights and duties they assumed. The City Government of Tacloban did not even file any action or motion to set aside the agreement. It is settled that a compromise agreement, once stamped with judicial imprimatur, becomes more than a mere contract and acquires the force and effect of a judgment that is immediately final and executory.[30] As such, the City Government of Tacloban cannot, later, relieve itself of liability simply because the city council changed its position. To be sure, the RTC issued a writ of execution on July 1, 2009, to enforce the agreement as a matter of course. The validity of the writ of execution was settled with finality in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.Corollarily, the CA correctly applied the principle of res judicata in dismissing the petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. The elements of res judicata are: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.[31] Apropos is Section (Sec.) 47, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to wit:SEC. 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2013 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:x x x x(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. Based on the above-quoted provision, res judicata is applicable either under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" under Sec. 47 (b), Rule 39; or \"conclusiveness of judgment\" under Sec. 47 (c), Rule 39. Case law explained that if there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action in the two cases, then res judicata in its aspect as a \"bar by prior judgment\" would apply. If, as between the two cases, only identity of parties can be shown, but not identical causes of action, then res judicata as \"conclusiveness of judgment\" applies,[32] thus:There is \"bar by prior judgment\" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action. Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or any other tribunal.But where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of res judicata known as \"conclusiveness of judgment.\" Stated differently, any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.[33] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) Here, as opposed to the CA's conclusion, all the requisites of res judicata under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" and not \"conclusiveness of judgment\" are present. First, it is undisputed that the final decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, as to the validity of the writ of execution was rendered with jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as over the parties, and it was a judgment on the merits. Second, there can be no question as to the identity of the parties in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, i.e., Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban. Third, the subject matters of the two cases are also identical. The City Government of Tacloban in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 contested the propriety of enforcing the compromise agreement due to the city council's withdrawal of ratification. Meanwhile, the City Government of Tacloban questioned again the implementation of the agreement on the basis of the previously quashed July 1, 2009 writ of execution. Notably, the quashal of the writ of execution was already reversed, and the RTC's ruling thereon, was the very order assailed in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. Undoubtedly, the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, both concern the satisfaction of the judgment based on the approved compromise agreement.Lastly, the two cases involve similar causes of action. The test to determine whether the causes of action are identical, is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.[34] Verily, the petitions in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, have the same underlying objectives, i.e., to prevent the enforcement of the compromise agreement. Also, the City Government of Tacloban presented the same evidence to prove its claims in both cases. The fact that two cases involve different RTC resolutions does not prevent the application of res judicata. Suffice it to say that a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies.[35] Taken together, the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, is rightfully dismissed for being barred by the prior final judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.We reiterate that nothing is more settled in law than the doctrine of immutability of judgments. Otherwise, there would be no end to litigation and would set to naught the main role of courts of justice to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law, and the settling of justiciable controversies with finality.[36] It is in the interest of justice that the Court writes finis to this dispute.FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED.

SACRAMENTO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\n\nThe doctrine of res judicata requires that stability be accorded to judgments lest there would be endless controversies. The relitigation of issues already settled burdens the courts and the taxpayers, creates uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be devoted to worthier causes. [1] We apply this policy in this Petition for Review on Certiorari [2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals-Cebu City's (CA) Decision [3] dated April 30, 2015 in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 07675.\n\nANTECEDENTS\nSpouses Esteban R. Sacramento and Salvacion Siony L. Sacramento (Spouses Sacramento) owned parcels of land situated in Barangay Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tacloban City which includes Lot No. 4144. The City Government of Tacloban, with authority from the Sangguniang Panlungsod, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for eminent domain over a portion of Lot No. 4144 for use as access road to the city's dumpsite. [4] On September 8, 2008, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement [5] with the following terms and conditions, to wit:\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby undertake as follows:\n\n(1) The FIRST PARTY shall pay unto the SECOND PARTIES the amount of TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]280.00), Philippine Currency, per square meter, as compensation for the acquisition of Lot No. 4144, with an area of about 49,057 sq. meters or a total amount of THIRTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY PESOS ([P]13,735,960.00), Philippine Currency, the lot being the subject of the above-captioned, under the following payment schedule:\n1.1) One-half (1/2) or the amount of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) to be paid after ratification of this Compromise Agreement by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban;\n\n1.2) The other half of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) shall be paid in two (2) equal installments in the amount of THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY PESOS ([P]3,433,990.00) in the succeeding two (2) quarters; (2) The SECOND PARTY shall pay all realty taxes, documentary stamp tax, capital gains tax, sales tax, transfer tax, registration fees, estate tax and other liabilities in connection with the land subject of the above-captioned case and the sale, transfer or conveyance of the same as well as all their obligations and obligations to other parties including those in favor of their lawyer;\n\n(3) The parties agree to, and shall cause, the dismissal, with prejudice, of the above-captioned case, including all claims and counterclaims therein, and agree not to file any similar case, whether civil, administrative or criminal, of any kind or nature whatsoever, arising from the same facts, incident, claim, cause or causes of action;\n\n(4) The parties hereby mutually, irrevocably, freely, and voluntarily release and forever discharge one another, from any and all manner of action, causes of action, sum of money, damages, liability, responsibility, obligation, claims and demands whatsoever in law or equity, which they had, now have, or may have against each other, including, but not limited to, actual, moral, exemplary and all other damages or causes of action provided for under the law if any, arising, directly or indirectly, from the facts and circumstances giving rise to, surrounding or arising from the complaint and/or counterclaims in the Pending Case, all of which claims or causes of action by these presents the parties hereby abandon and waive;\n\n(5) This agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission on the part of any party of any fault, negligence, or liability, of whatever kind and nature, in connection with the Pending Case;\n\n(6) That the parties hereto agree to declare the FIRST PARTY as the true, legal, and absolute owner of the property subject matter hereof;\n\n(7) In case of material breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the innocent party is hereby authorized to apply for a writ of execution in the Pending Case for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms and conditions of this agreement. [6] (Emphases in the original.) On September 18, 2008, the RTC, presided by Judge Rogelio C. Sescon (Judge Sescon) approved the Compromise Agreement and directed the parties to comply with its terms and conditions. [7] On September 24, 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified the agreement through Resolution No. 2008-10-530 stating: \" RESOLVE, as it is hereby resolved, to confirm/ratify the Compromise Agreement entered into by the Parties in Civil Case No. 2006-01-04 and duly approved by Hon. Rogelio C. Sescon, Presiding Judge, RTC Branch 9, Tacloban City dated September 18, 2008 [.]\" [8] On November 19, 2008, however, the Sangguniang Panlungsod withdrew its ratification and issued Resolution No. 2008-10-581 entitled \"RESOLUTION WITHDRAWING/RESCINDING AND/OR REPEALING AND DECLARING AS NULL AND VOID RESOLUTION NO. 2008-10-530 PASSED AND APPROVED BY THIS HONORABLE BODY ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2008.\" [9]\n\nMeantime, Spouses Sacramento moved for the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On March 16, 2009, the RTC denied [10] the motion for execution in view of the withdrawal of the city council's ratification of the compromise agreement, viz. :\nThis Court after going over the allegations of the parties, allegations, and counter-allegations in their subject motion and comments and/or oppositions and finding that the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban City had passed and approved Resolution No. 2008-10-[581] withdrawing/rescinding and declaring as null and void Resolution No. 2008-10-530 so that there is no more compromise agreement to speak of, finds the defendants' motion for execution of judgment to be devoid of merit, and therefore, this Court denies the same.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11] Spouses Sacramento filed a motion for reconsideration. On June 4, 2009, the RTC granted the motion, [12] and ordered the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On July 1, 2009, a Writ of Execution [13] was issued. Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, [14] the City Government of Tacloban elevated the case to the CA through a Petition for Certiorari [15] docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 04526. The City Government of Tacloban argued that public funds are not subject to levy and execution, and that the judgment based on a compromise agreement cannot be enforced without a valid ratification from the city council. [16]\n\nOn June 22, 2011, the CA dismissed the petition for certiorari absent grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC, [17] thus:\nThe parties' decision to enter into judicial compromise agreements to put an end to litigation is recognized in this jurisdiction. The court cannot impose a judgment different from the terms of a compromise agreement when such concurrence is not contrary to law, judicial decision, morals, good customs, or public policy. Once judicially approved, a compromise agreement becomes more than a binding contract to the parties and has the effect of res judicata . Just like any final judgment, \"the winning party is entitled to a writ of execution and the issuance thereof becomes a court's ministerial duty.\" The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that a judgment upon a compromise is immediately executory, where neither party moved to have it set aside on the ground of vices of consent or forgery.\n\nBefore this Court, petitioner invoked Sangguniang Panglungsod's Resolution No. 2008-10-581 dated 19 November 2008, which rescinded its prior ratification of the subject Compromise Agreement because \"following the passage of [Resolution No. 2008-10-530], Hon. Ranulfo S. Abellanosa discovered that the subject land, Lot 4144, to be acquired from Spouses Esteban and Salvacion Sacramento exceeded greatly in area and price from what was authorized to the city mayor to acquire x x x\" and further cited grounds which make the enforcement of the issued writ of execution invalid due to lack of enabling laws.\n\nUnfortunately for petitioner, it can no longer impugn the validity of the Writ of Execution of 18 September 2008 which was issued out of public respondent's [fulfillment] of a ministerial duty. A final judgment is a vested right, which is protected by law. Certainly, \"a party upon whose initiative an agreement was made, on the basis of which the court rendered judgment, is estopped to question the propriety of the action of the court, in the absence of showing that his consent to the agreement was secured through fraud, which at any rate could not possibly exist, the agreement being of his own making.\" [18] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) The CA's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 lapsed into finality. On February 23, 2012, the CA issued an entry of judgment. Later, Spouses Sacramento moved before the RTC to direct the City Government of Tacloban to comply with the compromise agreement. On June 23, 2011, the RTC granted the motion and issued the corresponding alias writ of execution, and notices of attachment and levy. [19] Undaunted, the City Government of Tacloban moved to quash the writ of execution and to lift the notices of attachment and levy. On October 24, 2011, the RTC granted the motion. [20]\n\nDissatisfied, Spouses Sacramento sought reconsideration but was denied. Thereafter, Judge Sescon inhibited and the case was transferred to Judge Frisco T. Lilagan (Judge Lilagan). Spouses Sacramento, again, moved for the issuance an alias writ of execution. On November 28, 2012, the RTC ruled that an alias writ is no longer necessary and ordered to continue the enforcement of the writ of execution issued on July 1, 2009, [21] to wit:\nFirst: This Court just like the original Court, being merely Regional Trial Courts, cannot modify, defy, violate, or much less reverse the Decision of the Honorable Court of Appeals affirming the validity and legality of the Writ of Execution which the original Court issued. It must be stressed that this Decision of the Court of Appeals had already attained its finality without the said Decision having been appealed.\n\nx x x x\nIt must be remembered that the Decision in this case is by reason of a Compromise Agreement, and a Compromise Agreement once approved by the Court becomes immediately final and executory. The Order approving the Compromise Agreement was issued on September 18, 2008. Legally and technically, therefore, the Writ of Execution issued to enforce the Compromise Agreement is still valid and subsisting. It is in this regard that this Court finds it unnecessary to issue an Alias Writ of Execution, instead to order the herein executing Sheriff, Sheriff IV LUDY C. MARMITA to execute and enforce the said Writ of Execution dated July 1, 2009 already issued and to make a return thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Court . [22] (Emphasis supplied.) Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, the City Government of Tacloban, again, elevated the case to the CA through a petition for review on certiorari docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. [23] The City Government of Tacloban posited that Judge Lilagan erred in implementing the writ of execution which a co-equal court had quashed and lifted. [24] On April 30, 2015, the CA dismissed the petition on the ground of res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment, viz :\nThe elements of res judicata under the concept of conclusiveness of judgment are:\nIdentity of parties; and\n\nSubject matter in the first and second cases. The presence of the first element is not disputed considering that the parties in G.R. SP No. 04526 and in this case are similar. Also attendant is the last element, identity of the subject matter or the issue. A perusal of the allegations in the present case evidently shows that the petitioner mentioned issues similarly raised and already resolved in G.R. SP No. 04526. It must be emphasized that the order assailed in the present case is just enforcing the Writ of Execution issued on July 1, 2009 which was already passed upon in G.R. SP No. 04526. [25] Hence, this petition. [26] The City Government of Tacloban insists that the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 are different. In CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, the question is whether Judge Sescon committed grave abuse of discretion in enforcing the compromise agreement. On the other hand, the issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is whether Judge Lilagan was correct in implementing the previously quashed writ of execution dated July 1, 2009. [27]\n\nRULING\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\n\nIt bears emphasis that a compromise agreement is in the nature of both a contract and a judgment on the merits. [28] As a contract, the compromise agreement can only be avoided on grounds of illegality, lack of consent, fraud or duress. [29] In this case, Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban freely and voluntarily entered into a compromise agreement. The terms and conditions of the agreement are likewise clear. Moreover, the RTC approved the agreement and the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified it. The parties knew exactly the rights and duties they assumed. The City Government of Tacloban did not even file any action or motion to set aside the agreement. It is settled that a compromise agreement, once stamped with judicial imprimatur, becomes more than a mere contract and acquires the force and effect of a judgment that is immediately final and executory. [30] As such, the City Government of Tacloban cannot, later, relieve itself of liability simply because the city council changed its position. To be sure, the RTC issued a writ of execution on July 1, 2009, to enforce the agreement as a matter of course. The validity of the writ of execution was settled with finality in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.\n\nCorollarily, the CA correctly applied the principle of res judicata in dismissing the petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. The elements of res judicata are: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. [31] Apropos is Section (Sec.) 47, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to wit:\nSEC. 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2013 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:\nx x x x\n(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and\n\n(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. Based on the above-quoted provision, res judicata is applicable either under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" under Sec. 47 (b), Rule 39; or \"conclusiveness of judgment\" under Sec. 47 (c), Rule 39. Case law explained that if there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action in the two cases, then res judicata in its aspect as a \"bar by prior judgment\" would apply. If, as between the two cases, only identity of parties can be shown, but not identical causes of action, then res judicata as \"conclusiveness of judgment\" applies, [32] thus:\nThere is \"bar by prior judgment\" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action . Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or any other tribunal.\n\nBut where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of res judicata known as \"conclusiveness of judgment.\" Stated differently, any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same. [33] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) Here, as opposed to the CA's conclusion, all the requisites of res judicata under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" and not \"conclusiveness of judgment \" are present. First , it is undisputed that the final decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, as to the validity of the writ of execution was rendered with jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as over the parties, and it was a judgment on the merits. Second , there can be no question as to the identity of the parties in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, i.e. , Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban. Third , the subject matters of the two cases are also identical. The City Government of Tacloban in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 contested the propriety of enforcing the compromise agreement due to the city council's withdrawal of ratification. Meanwhile, the City Government of Tacloban questioned again the implementation of the agreement on the basis of the previously quashed July 1, 2009 writ of execution. Notably, the quashal of the writ of execution was already reversed, and the RTC's ruling thereon, was the very order assailed in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. Undoubtedly, the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, both concern the satisfaction of the judgment based on the approved compromise agreement.\n\nLastly , the two cases involve similar causes of action. The test to determine whether the causes of action are identical, is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. [34] Verily, the petitions in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, have the same underlying objectives, i.e. , to prevent the enforcement of the compromise agreement. Also, the City Government of Tacloban presented the same evidence to prove its claims in both cases. The fact that two cases involve different RTC resolutions does not prevent the application of res judicata . Suffice it to say that a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies. [35] Taken together, the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, is rightfully dismissed for being barred by the prior final judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.\n\nWe reiterate that nothing is more settled in law than the doctrine of immutability of judgments. Otherwise, there would be no end to litigation and would set to naught the main role of courts of justice to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law, and the settling of justiciable controversies with finality. [36] It is in the interest of justice that the Court writes finis to this dispute.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated April 30, 2015 in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPerlas-Bernabe, SAJ. (Chairperson), Gesmundo, Lazaro-Javier, and Rosario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Monterona v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., G.R.

BERTENI CATALU\u00d1A CAUSING, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nLEONEN, SAJ.:\n\nWhile a disbarred lawyer cannot be suspended or disbarred again, these penalties may be formally recorded in case a reinstatement is sought in the future. [1]\n\nThis Court resolves the administrative Complaint [2] filed against Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing (Atty. Causing) for allegedly filing numerous malicious, unfounded, and baseless complaints against Dr. Joyce T. Hidalgo (Dr. Hidalgo), his counsel, and other government officials involved in the demolition of the houses of Atty. Causing's clients. [3] The Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines recommended that Atty. Causing be reprimanded. [4] However, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors modified the recommended penalty to a one-year suspension from the practice of law. [5]\n\nOn January 5, 2018, Dr. Hidalgo filed an administrative Complaint [6] against Atty. Causing for violation of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. [7]\n\nDr. Hidalgo claimed that Atty. Causing deliberately refused to comply with several court decisions which had attained finality. Aside from this, he allegedly filed numerous malicious, unfounded, and baseless complaints against her and other government officials and a disbarment complaint against her counsel. This was supposedly to secure leverage in a pending case and convince them to yield. These cases were ultimately dismissed by the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, and the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao Station. [8]\n\nFurther, Dr. Hidalgo stated that Atty. Causing charged Hon. Emmanuel Escatron (Judge Escatron), the presiding judge of Branch 2, Regional Trial Court, Butuan City, with allegedly receiving PHP 16,000,000.00 from Dr. Hidalgo in exchange for issuing the Alias Writ of Demolition. Yet, his allegations were made without any evidence. Dr. Hidalgo denied making any payment to Judge Escatron, especially since he already had difficulty paying for the legal services of his counsel. [9]\n\nAs such, Dr. Hidalgo maintained that Atty. Causing violated the Lawyer's Oath and multiple provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility as he perpetuated falsehood and filed multiple groundless, false, and unlawful suits. [10]\n\nThe following documents were attached to the Complaint to support the allegations: the Court of Appeals' October 27, 2017 Decision in Villar v. Escatron affirming the lower court's issuance of a second Alias Writ of Demolition; [11] the Court's October 8, 2014 Resolution dismissing the petition in Members of Iglesia Ni Cristo v. The Honorable Court of Appeals ; [12] Atty. Causing's complaint-affidavit in Causing v. Amante, Jr. , where Dr. Hidalgo and other government officials were impleaded as respondents; [13] and the Office of the Ombudsman's Joint Order in Amante denying Atty. Causing's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his complaint. [14]\n\nIn his Verified Answer with Motion for Leave to Admit Answer, [15] Atty. Causing stated that he had no participation in most of the cases mentioned. He pointed out that the cases were filed by an Atty. Froilan A. Montero. [16] The sole complaint he filed was the one against Dr. Hidalgo for grave misconduct, oppression, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. This complaint was even supported by the affidavits of the demolition victims. [17]\n\nIn a Resolution, [18] the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines recommended that Atty. Causing be sternly warned and reprimanded for referencing the administrative complaint filed against Judge Escatron for allegedly receiving a bribe of PHP 16,000,000.00 in his Amante complaint-affidavit. As the accusation was based on a mere rumor, wholly unverified, and made without any personal knowledge, Atty. Causing should have refrained from stating it. As such, Atty. Causing was found to have violated the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. [19]\n\nNonetheless, it ruled that the quantum of evidence necessary to link Atty. Causing to Villar and Members of Iglesia Ni Cristo was not met. [20]\n\nOn March 18, 2022, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors issued a Resolution [21] modifying its Report and Recommendation by increasing the recommended penalty to suspension from the practice of law for one year. [22] It took into consideration Atty. Causing's prior suspension by this Court in Administrative Case No. 12883. [23]\n\nAtty. Causing filed his May 27, 2022 Motion for Reconsideration. [24] He clarified that he was not among the complainants in the administrative complaint filed against Judge Escatron, although he entered his appearance as their pro bono lawyer. Prior to filing the case, he ensured the veracity of his clients' allegations that Judge Escatron was involved in bribery. [25]\n\nAs regards Amante , Atty. Causing explained that he was merely stating a fact that an administrative complaint exists involving Judge Escatron's alleged bribery. He did not provide any remark or opinion on this matter. As such, he prayed that the Resolution of Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors be reversed, and the Complaint against him be dismissed. [26]\n\nThe Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines then issued its May 27, 2022 Order. [27] It stated that the filing of a motion for reconsideration was no longer allowed. Nonetheless, the entire records of the case will be forwarded to the Supreme Court. [28]\n\nOn November 15, 2022, Atty. Causing filed a Manifestation [29] before the Court praying that his attached May 27, 2022 Motion for Reconsideration [30] be considered in ruling on his case.\n\nIn its February 22, 2023 Resolution, [31] this Court noted the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors' Notice of Resolution No. CBD-XXV-2022-03-39; the copy of Atty. Causing's Motion for Reconsideration; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines' transmittal of the documents pertaining to the case; and Atty. Causing's November 15, 2022 Manifestation.\n\nThe issue for this Court's resolution is whether respondent Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability.\n\nOn May 30, 2023, the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, which repealed the Code of Professional Responsibility, took effect. [32] The former provides that its provisions \"shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the [Court], its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.\" [33]\n\nThus, although respondent's assailed actions were committed prior the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability's effectivity, its provisions shall be applied to determine his administrative liability.\n\nThe following provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability require lawyers to refrain from filing or causing to be filed frivolous or baseless cases against lawyers and government officers, including judges:\nCANON II\nPropriety\nSECTION 13. Imputation of a misconduct, impropriety, or crime without basis . \u2014 A lawyer shall not, directly or indirectly, impute to or accuse another lawyer of a misconduct, impropriety, or a crime in the absence of factual or legal basis.\n\nNeither shall a lawyer, directly or indirectly, file or cause to be filed, or assist in the filing of frivolous or baseless administrative, civil, or criminal complaints against another lawyer.\n\nSECTION 14. Remedy for grievances; insinuation of improper motive . \u2014 A lawyer shall submit grievances against any officer of a court, tribunal, or other government agency only through the appropriate remedy and before the proper authorities.\n\nStatements insinuating improper motive on the part of any such officer, which are not supported by substantial evidence, shall be ground for disciplinary action. While lawyers have the right to \"criticize the acts of courts and judges in respectful terms and through legitimate channels... [this right] is not an unbridled freedom to malign and slander the courts and its officers; and criticisms must be supported by evidence and ventilated in the proper forum.\" [34] As stated in Alpajora v. Calayan : [35]\nAs officers of the court, lawyers are duty-bound to observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and judicial officers. They are to abstain from offensive or menacing language or behavior before the court and must refrain from attributing to a judge motives that are not supported by the record or have no materiality to the case.\n\n. . . .\n\nIt must be remembered that all lawyers are bound to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts, and to promote confidence in the fair administration of justice. It is the respect for the courts that guarantees the stability of the judicial institution; elsewise, the institution would be resting on a very shaky foundation.\n\nHence, no matter how passionate a lawyer is towards defending his client's cause, he must not forget to display the appropriate decorum expected of him, being a member of the legal profession, and to continue to afford proper and utmost respect due to the courts. [36] In Alpajora , a lawyer was suspended for two years for consistently making unsupported imputations in his pleadings that a judge had improper ties with adverse counsels, among others. His act of attributing ill motives to the judge, which were neither supported by the record nor had any materiality to the case, was a violation of Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. [37]\n\nRegarding the allegations in the present Complaint, this Court agrees with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines that there is insufficient evidence to show that respondent was involved in Villar and Members of Iglesia Ni Cristo .\n\nThe crux of this case is respondent's statement in his complaint-affidavit regarding Judge Escatron. Respondent stated that the Sinumpaang Reklamo of the 24 residents whose houses were demolished named Judge Escatron as among the errant government officials. However, Judge Escatron was not included in the complaint because a disciplinary case was already filed against him for allegedly accepting a bribe in the amount of PHP 16,000,000.00. The complaint-affidavit states:\n13. These names of the respondents and the contents of the instant complaint are based on twenty-four (24) individual \" Sinumpaang Reklamo \" executed in handwriting by the residents whose homes have been demolished;\n\n14. Copies of these \" Sinumpaang Reklamo \" are hereto attached as follows:\n\n. . . .\n\n15. Actually, these 24 \" Sinumpaang Reklamo \" named Judge Emmanuel E. Escatron and the sheriffs of Butuan RTCs but these court officials are not included in this complaint because they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and, besides, a separate complaint was already filed before the Supreme Court against Judge Escatron.\n\n. . . .\n\n39. In the complaint filed before the Supreme Court against Judge Escatron, the complainants alleged that it was rumored that Sixteen Million Pesos (P16,000,000.00) was given to officials to ensure the success of the demolition[.] [38] As Judge Escatron was not a party in Amante , there was no need to make any statement regarding the administrative case, much less state that a member of the Judiciary is facing a bribery charge. That respondent had no personal knowledge of its veracity should have prevented him from charging someone based solely on rumors and hearsay. This is conduct unbecoming of the standards expected from a lawyer with knowledge of legal processes.\n\nFurther, Judge Escatron's administrative case was immaterial to respondent's suit before the Office of the Ombudsman. This too should have caused respondent to stay his hand. Instead, he chose to act in an unethical manner and undermined the integrity of the legal profession. This is not only indicative of a lack of respect for the Judiciary but also reveals his failure to uphold the principles of honesty and fairness\u2014all of which reflect his unfitness to practice law. \"[U]nsubstantiated accusations against judges spurred by ill-motives warrant administrative sanctions.\" [39]\n\nThis Court now determines the proper penalty to be imposed upon respondent. On this note, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that respondent has been disciplined twice within the last four years and is in fact currently disbarred.\n\nIn Velasco v. Causing , [40] respondent published on his Facebook account a post entitled \"Wise Polygamous Husband?\" and attached photographs of Enrico R. Velasco's (Velasco) petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. Respondent not only shared this post to his other Facebook account and a Facebook group under his name, which had approximately 3,500 members, but also to Velasco's son through direct message. For these acts, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for one year with a stern warning that the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely. [41]\n\nThe administrative case of Lao v. Causing [42] on the other hand, involved respondent's January 18, 2019 posting on his Facebook account of his draft complaint-affidavit for plunder against Jackiya A. Lao (Lao) and other persons. Lao proved that Atty. Causing's post \"elicit[ed] negative reactions, comments and public opinions against Lao and her fellow respondents.\" [43] Lao was \"subjected to public hate, contempt and ridicule, as several people have commented on the said post. The respondents in the complaint for plunder, including Lao, were called several names including ' nangungurakot ' and ' corrupt na official .'\" [44] This Court observed that respondent was motivated by his desire to ruin the reputation of Lao and the others involved in his complaint. Respondent's subsequent filing of the complaint was deemed immaterial as he already succeeded in damaging their reputation. As respondent was a repeat offender, this Court disbarred him from the practice of law:\nHere, the Court takes note of the fact that Atty. Causing had just recently served his one-year suspension pursuant to the ruling in the Velasco case, which was promulgated on March 2, 2021. We likewise note that the acts complained of therein occurred in April 2016 and the corresponding disbarment complaint was filed thereafter. The filing of the disbarment complaint against Atty. Causing in the Velasco case should have served as a deterrent. However, it appears that the same had no effect. Thus, the penalty of disbarment is warranted [45] Respondent's pattern of misconduct reveals a gross disregard for ethical standards. His inclusion of unsubstantiated accusations not only damaged Judge Escatron's reputation as a member of the bench but eroded the public's confidence in the courts and their integrity in administering justice. This is anathema to respondent's duty as an officer of the court to uphold honesty and respect for the Judiciary.\n\nDespite respondent's disbarment, this Court may still prescribe the proper penalty commensurate to his violation for record purposes. Canon VI, Section 42 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability reads:\nSECTION 42. Penalty when the respondent has been previously disbarred. \u2014 When the respondent has been previously disbarred and is subsequently found guilty of a new charge, the Court may impose a fine or order the disbarred lawyer to return the money or property to the client, when proper. If the new charge deserves the penalty of a disbarment or suspension from the practice of law, it shall not be imposed but the penalty shall be recorded in the personal file of the disbarred lawyer in the Office of the Bar Confidant or other office designated for the purpose. In the event that the disbarred lawyer applies for judicial clemency, the penalty so recorded shall be considered in the resolution of the same. Recording the new ethical violation in an already-disbarred lawyer's official file maintained by the Office of the Bar Confidant serves a vital function. Should the disbarred lawyer ever apply for reinstatement, this documented history of ethical violations would weigh heavily in the decision, making reinstatement more difficult to obtain. [46]\n\nAs such, this Court finds that respondent exhibited grossly undignified conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, which is a serious offense under Section 33(i) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. Under Canon VI, Section 37 thereof, this Court may impose the following sanctions for serious offenses: \"(1) [d]isbarment; (2) [s]uspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months; (3) [r]evocation of notarial commission and disqualification as notary public for not less than two (2) years; or (4) [a] fine exceeding [PHP] 100,000.00.\" [47]\n\nFurther, Canon VI, Sections 38 and 39 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability holds that a respondent's previous administrative liability is an aggravating circumstance that may warrant the imposition of the penalty of disbarment. [48]\n\nGiven the above considerations, this Court finds that the imposition of the ultimate penalty of disbarment upon respondent is proper. There is no question that respondent has the propensity for disregarding the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and violating his oath as a lawyer: \"Membership in the legal profession is a privilege, and whenever it is made to appear that an attorney is no longer worthy of the trust and confidence of his clients and the public, it becomes not only the right but also the duty of the Court to withdraw the same.\" [49] As held in PHILCOMSAT Holdings Corporation v. Atty. Lokin, Jr. : [50]\nIt must be reiterated that as an officer of the court, it is a lawyer's sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice; as acts and/or omissions emanating from lawyers which tend to undermine the judicial edifice is disastrous to the continuity of the government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people. Thus, all lawyers should be bound not only to safeguard the good name of the legal profession, but also to keep inviolable the honor, prestige, and reputation of the judiciary. [51] (Citation omitted) ACCORDINGLY , the Court finds respondent Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing GUILTY of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and sentences him to DISBARMENT from the practice of law. However, in view of his existing disbarment, the present penalty of disbarment can no longer be imposed, but should nonetheless be considered should he apply for reinstatement.\n\nLet a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be entered into Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing's records. Copies shall likewise be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Inting, Zalameda, M.
