  "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. PEDRITO AÃONUEVO Y BORAL ALIAS HANGER, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: Accused-appellant anchors his bid for acquittal on the defense of alibi, but, not heeding the settled doctrines enunciated by this Court in numerous cases, fails to meet the requirements for its plausible application.This is an appeal from the judgment of the trial court[1] convicting Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral, a.k.a. \"Hanger\", of the crime of murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, to indemnify the heirs of the victim Rufino EreÃ±o in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.[2]The FactsThis case was commenced by an Information charging the accused-appellant as follows:[3]\"That on or about the 9th day of March 1993, at about 7:30 oâclock in the evening, in Barangay Tubigdanao, Municipality of San Jose, Province of Northern Samar, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused armed with a homemade shotgun, with deliberate intent to kill thru treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack(,) assault and shoot RUFINO EREÃEO (sic) with the use of said weapon which the accused had provided himself for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon said Rufino EreÃ±eo (sic) several gunshot wounds which caused the instant death of said victim.\"The accused-appellant pleaded Not Guilty when arraigned.Prior to commencement of trial, the prosecution and the accused agreed upon the following stipulation of facts:[4]\"1. Any mention or reference to the name Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral also known as Hanger identifies the accused;2. Fact of death of the victim, Rufino D. EreÃ±o, is reflected in the medico-legal certificate, Exh. âAâ, page 3, and certificate of death, Exh. âBâ, page 4 of the case folio;3. The time, date and place of the incident, 7:30 oâclock in the evening, March 9, 1993, in Barangay Tubigdanao, Municipality of San Jose, Northern Samar;\"The prosecution had as its witnesses Fe EreÃ±o and Julio EreÃ±o, the wife and brother of the victim respectively, and SPO4 Ricardo Sudio, the deputy chief of police in San Jose, Northern Samar. The defense, on the other hand, presented the accused-appellant himself and his wife Nora AÃ±onuevo.The victim, Rufino EreÃ±o, was autopsied the day after the incident, and was found to have succumbed to shock secondary to internal hemorrhage as a result of the gunshot wounds he sustained in different parts of the body, the number, nature and locations of which are detailed in the autopsy report (Exhibit \"A\").[5]The trial court summarized the circumstances surrounding the killing as follows:[6]\"At about 7:30 in the evening on March 9, 1993, at a place less than a kilometer from the barangay proper of Tubigdanao, the family of Rufino EreÃ±o was preparing to retire for the night. The husband was lying down on the side of the one-room affair dwelling hut. Their three children ages seven, six and two and a half, were also inside. Fe EreÃ±o was towards the rear of the house at the kitchenâs yard transferring the small pig to a place inside the house for the evening. She was around three or four brazas to where her husband was. It was there that she heard a gunfire from that direction and saw the accused at a distance of around one-half meter to the house and at the side thereof where her husband lay. The accused was around three brazas to her carrying a long gun in fort position as he withdrew and ran away. She dashed inside the house and saw her husband vomiting blood with injuries at the left of the neck and towards the nape. She ran to the barangay poblacion to the house of one Banker Ballesta, the son of the barangay captain who went to the place of the incident. From there, Ballesta motored to the town and notified Julio EreÃ±o, the victimâs younger brother, who, in turn notified the police. The report was recorded in the police blotter (Exh. \"1\"). It was around 8:00 oâclock in the evening. The body was brought to the townâs district of P. Tingzon where the grieving widow told Julio EreÃ±o and deputy chief of police Ricardo Sudio of the gun wielder to be the accused.The accused is long familiar to the EreÃ±o spouses. Fe EreÃ±o used to see him whenever he goes to town. He resides in a farm at another barangay. She told that her husband was killed because whoever makes copra for Juan AÃ±onuevo, the accusedâs nephew, would be resented by the accused. The victim used to make copra for Juan AÃ±onuevo at the latterâs coconut land. Other hired hands are residents of Tubigdanao who stopped working for Juan AÃ±onuevo. She heard that the accused prohibited them from working for Juan. The victim last made copra in February, the month before his death.Julio EreÃ±o testified that immediately after Ballesta told him of the shooting of his brother, he notified the police at the municipal hall who recorded his report (Exh. \"1\"). He met Fe EreÃ±o, his sister-in-law, later at P. Tingzon in town.x x x x x x x x xThe accused testified that the victim was a friend and they see each other often. Fe EreÃ±o was also his friend and knows her since she was small. He branded her accusation as a lie. On March 9, 1993, in the evening he was at home sleeping with his wife and their small child. His house is in San Lorenzo, a barangay around five kilometers to the town. From San Lorenzo to Tubigdanao is around two kilometers accessible only by a footpath and can be negotiated in about ten minutes by walking at a fast pace. He came to know of the death of Rufino EreÃ±o only on the 24th of March, 1993, when he was told he was subpoenaed. He was always at home from March 10, 1993, up to his arrest on March 27. He could not think of any reason as to why Fe EreÃ±o would accuse and testify to impute a crime upon an innocent person. He claims that the killer was not even identified for Julio EreÃ±o, the victimâs brother, reported to the police that the gunman could not be identified (Exh. \"1\"). Juan AÃ±onuevo is his nephew who owns two parcels of land in San Lorenzo which came from the formerâs father. His coconut land is situated between these properties of Juan with whom he maintains good relationship. The victim was only one of those hired to make copra by Juan AÃ±onuevo and the last time he made copra was in February this year. Nora AÃ±onuevo, his wife, vouched for his presence at their home during the whole evening of March 9, 1993.\"After trial, the court a quo rendered judgment as follows:\"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral, also known as Hanger, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and, with neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances to consider, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, to indemnify the heirs of Rufino EreÃ±o in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.\"The IssuesBefore this Court, accused-appellant assigns the following errors:[7]\"IThe court a quo erred in giving weight and credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and in disregarding the theory of the defense despite the evidence to the contrary.IIThe court a quo erred in convicting accused-appellant notwithstanding the fact that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.\"In his brief, accused-appellant centers his arguments on two main issues: the credibility of the prosecutionâs key witness and the weight to be given the defense of alibi.The Courtâs RulingFirst Issue: Credibility of Prosecution WitnessAppellant assails the credibility of the main witness for the prosecution, the victimâs wife Fe EreÃ±o. Appellant claims Fe EreÃ±o could not have seen her husbandâs assailant, for while she was present at the premises, nevertheless she did not see the actual shooting, as she was at the back of the kitchen busy attending to a piglet, and therefore had no opportunity to get a good view of the assailant. The defense also laid emphasis on the fact that it was nighttime, and the prosecution had not established taht the victim's house was situated in a place where there were no plants and trees in the surroundings which could have obstructed the moonlight from fully illuminating the scene or which might otherwise have prevented Fe EreÃ±o from seeing the person of the assailant. Thus, the accused claims, her identification of appellant as her husband's killer is unreliable and untrustworthy. Her testimony, aside from being biased, is uncorroborated and therefore also insufficient to convict appellant.[8]We disagree. The record shows that Fe EreÃ±o was in a position to see her husband's killer. Her testimony was to the effect that her family's dwelling was a small one-room hut. At the time she heard the gunshot, she was in their yard tethering their pig. The yard was near their kitchen, so she was in a good position to see appellant who was at the side of the hut, about three arms-lengths away from her, backing away from the house holding a long firearm in fort position, and then running away. Said she:\"QWhat were you doing at the time when you were in your house?AI was tethering our pig.QWhere was your pig at that time?A In our yardx x x x x x x x xQAt the time you were tethering your pig where was your husband?A He was lying down inside our house.QIn what part of the house was he lying down?A At the right side.Q Right side of what?A(witness repeating the answer) Right side.COURT:Q Your house is a one room affair?AYes, sir.FISCAL:QAnd while you were tethering your pig can you remember of any unusual incident that took place?AYes, sir.QWhat happened?AThere was an explosion.QWhat did you do upon hearing that explosion?AI did not know from where I was standing.QWhere were you standing?ANear our kitchen.Q And what did you observe?AThat was it I saw Pedrito.QWho is that Pedrito?A AÃ±onuevo.Q What was he doing when you saw him?AHe was moving backward carrying with him a long gun.Q You said that he was moving backward(,) from where he was he that he was moving backward?A Just near that place where my husband was lying.x x x x x x x x xQHow far were you to Pedrito AÃ±onuevo when you saw him?AAbout three brazas away.QAnd then what did you do next?AI ran inside the house.Qand what did you do xxx what did you discover inside your house?AI saw my husband vomiting already with blood.Q Why?ABecause he was shot.QUou said that he was shot(,) where was he hit?A He was hit on the left side of his neck (witness indicating the left side of his neck toward he nape).\"[9]Thanks to the defense counsel, the positive identification by Fe Ereno was further highlighted during cross-examination, where she testified as follows:\"QMy question is, where were you particularly when you heard the explosion, were you already up in the house or down in the yard?A At the time of the explosion I was still downstairs, where the pig was.Q Downstairs at the kitchen of your house?AYes, sir.QWhere the explosion you heard or genearted from the living portion of your house?A At the side.QIn that place from where you were when you heard the explosion the place could be seen by you, is it not?AYes, sir.QNo obstruction toward that direction?A None, sir.Q And you said the distance when you saw the accused between you and him was only three brazas, wat was your distance to the place where your husband was?AAbout four brazas.QHow soon did you see the accused after you heard gun fire?A Same time of the explosion.Q You mean when you heard the gun fire you turned your attention to where the same came from?AYes, sir.QAnd you saw xxx what did you see?A I saw the accused Pedrito AÃ±onuevo.QAt that instant you saw him what part of his body was exposed to you?AHis whole body.Q Yes, what part of the body facing you?AHis whole fromt body.QYou mean when he was already moving backward?AYes, sir, he was toward my right side.QYou mean, you glanced toward your right and you saw him moving backward?

She testified on direct:QHow long have you known this Pedrito AÃ±onuevo before that incident?A Long before because we frequently meet on the road.COURT:Q How often do you meet him on the road?A Always whenever he goes to town.QYou said that he goes to town, why where was he staying?A In the farm.Q Where is that farm? AIn San Jose, toward San Lorenzo.QIn whose land?A His own land.\"[13]During trial, the accused admitted that Fe EreÃ±o knew him just as well as he did her, and so the court a quo observed that, based on the surrounding circumstances, all the opportunities for a positive identification by the sole witness were present in this case.The trial court found the testimony of Fe EreÃ±o convincing. When the credibility of witnesses is at issue, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings and assessments of trial courts.[14] The credibility of witnesses is a matter best assessed by the trial court which had observed their demeanor and deportment during trial.[15] Findings of trial courts regarding the veracity of a testimony are given great weight and accorded high respect by this Court in the absence of a showing that they were reached arbitrarily.[16] We will not disturb these findings unless there is a clear showing that facts or circumstances of weight or substance have been overlooked or misunderstood which could affect the result of the case.[17] Appellant has not presented any reason why this case should be an exception to the general rule.Appellant claims Fe EreÃ±o failed to identify her husband's assailant to the police, and that the shooting was recorded in the police blotter on March 9, 1993 with the suspect unnamed and unidentified.[18] However the testimonies of prosecution witnesses reveal that it was Julio EreÃ±o, the victim's brother, who first reported the incident to the police, and at the time he did so, he did not yet know who the assailant of his brother was.[19] When Fe EreÃ±o was investigated on the same night of the shooting, she immediately identified appellant as her husband's killer.[20] This was established by the testimony of the Deputy Chief of Police who declared that Fe EreÃ±o revealed to him the accused as the killer upon their return to the town that night.[21]Fe EreÃ±o's identification of appellant is sufficient to convict him. It has repeatedly been held that the testimony of a single eyewitness if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court as to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to convict.[22]Appellant, instead of introducing evidence to show that Fe EreÃ±o had motive to testify falsely against him, even admitted that she had no reason to wrongly accuse him of the death of her husband.[23] The testimony of Fe EreÃ±o cannot be denied credence just because she happened to be the victim's wife. Mere relationship of a witness to the victim does not automatically impair his credibility and render his testimony less worthy of credence where no improper motive can be ascribed to him for testifying.[24] Rather, the witness' relationship to the victim, far from rendering her testimony biased, would even make it more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in seeking justice for the deceased to accuse somebody other than the real culprit.[25]Second Issue: Is the Alibi Airtight?In the face of the overwhelming evidence against him, appellant relies on the defense of alibi. He testified that he was at home sleeping with his wife and their young child when the shooting was committed. His wife corroborated his story, claiming that her husband was with her at home the whole night of March 9, 1993, and he never left the house.[26] The accused-appellant also claims he had no motive to kill Rufino EreÃ±o, insisting that the victim was his friend and that they knew each other quite well.[27]The rule is well-settled that in order for the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the offense was committed but it must likewise be demonstrated that he was so far away that it was not possible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.[28]\"Alibi, the plea of having been elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission of the felony, is a plausible excuse for the accused. Let there be no mistake about it. Contrary to the common notion, alibi is in fact a good defense. But to be valid for purposes of exoneration from a criminal charge, the defense of alibi must be such that it would have been physically impossible for the person charged with the crime to be at the locus criminis at the time of its commission, the reason being that no person can be in two places at the same time. The excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception. Where there is the least posibility of accused's presence at the crime scene, the alibi will not hold water.\" (underscoring ours)[29]In this case, appellant admitted that the place where the crime was committed could be reached from his place in approximately 10 to 20 minutes on foot. He said:\"Q How far is Tubigdanao to your house in San Lorenzo?AIt could be around two kilometers away.Q How many minutes would it take to negotiate from Tubigdanao to your house?A It could be around 20 minutes because there is no road in going there and you have only to hike, but if one is fast in walking it would only take around 10 minutes.QIs there a footpath?A Yes, sir.\"[30]In light of the foregoing testimony, the trial court certainly could not be faulted for not giving weight to accused-appellant's alibi. Besides being inherently weak for not being airtight, accused's alibi cannot prevail as against the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses.[31] Likewise, the testimony of appellant's wife is of little value to his defense, as it only corroborates his leaky alibi. Also, alibi has been held to become less plausible as a defense when it is mainly established by the accused himself and his immediate relatives.[32]His defense of lack of motive will likewise not prosper, as motive is immaterial where there is direct testimony of a credible witness and where the culpability of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt.[33] In any event, the trial court held that \"(i)t is not that there is want of any motive at all for the killing\", preferring to believe Fe EreÃ±o's testimony to the effect that the accused had threatened the workers who made copra for accused's nephew Juan AÃ±onuevo, and had told them he would treat them as his (accused's) enemies. Everyone but the victim desisted from making copra for Juan AÃ±onuevo; the victim last worked in February, the month before he was killed.Treachery Not ProvenHowever, although the trial court observed that:\"The killing is characterized by the treacherous manner it was perpetrated x x x. The victim certainly had no opportunity to defend himself and he was in no position to mount any defensive maneuver such as would subject the accused to any risk. Killing a sleeping victim was considered an example par excellence of the crime qualified by treachery (citing People vs. Curatchia, 97 SCRA 549 and People vs. Pajanustan, 97 SCRA 699) and the circumstance surrounding the shooting of Rufino EreÃ±o assumes no less consideration even without it being positively shown that he was aslept (sic).\"[34]the evidence fails to show that appellant's attack on Rufino EreÃ±o was committed with treachery. The most that can be said in this case is that the victim was reclining at one side of his one-room dwelling hut when he was shot, with the killer firing from outside the hut. There was no evidence, not even from the testimony of Fe EreÃ±o, that the victim was asleep, or that his back was turned to the accused when the latter fired the shot, or was otherwise in a defenseless position. All that Fe EreÃ±o saw was her husband vomiting blood. It is elementary that alevosia, to be appreciated, must be proven as clearly as the elements of the crime or crimes it is alleged to qualify. This the prosecution had failed to do. It should have proven that the accused had consciously and deliberately employed a form of attack to ensure the consummation of his objective without risk to himself from any defense the person assaulted could have made.[35] This cannot be said to have been done in the instant case. On the other hand, the trial court ruled out evident premeditation for lack of evidence, to which we agree.WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED, in that the accused-appellant Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral is found GUILTY of the crime of HOMICIDE, and that the penalty imposed upon him is the indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of prision mayor as minimum penalty, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal in its medium period, there being no aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as maximum penalty. The P50,000.00 civil indemnity for the victim's death is hereby AFFIRMED, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.

[2]\n\nThe Facts\nThis case was commenced by an Information charging the accused-appellant as follows: [3]\n\"That on or about the 9th day of March 1993, at about 7:30 oâclock in the evening, in Barangay Tubigdanao, Municipality of San Jose, Province of Northern Samar, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused armed with a homemade shotgun, with deliberate intent to kill thru treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack(,) assault and shoot RUFINO EREÃEO (sic) with the use of said weapon which the accused had provided himself for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon said Rufino EreÃ±eo (sic) several gunshot wounds which caused the instant death of said victim.\"\n\nThe accused-appellant pleaded Not Guilty when arraigned. Prior to commencement of trial, the prosecution and the accused agreed upon the following stipulation of facts: [4]\n\"1. Any mention or reference to the name Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral also known as Hanger identifies the accused;\n\n2. Fact of death of the victim, Rufino D. EreÃ±o, is reflected in the medico-legal certificate, Exh. âAâ, page 3, and certificate of death, Exh. âBâ, page 4 of the case folio;\n\n3. The time, date and place of the incident, 7:30 oâclock in the evening, March 9, 1993, in Barangay Tubigdanao, Municipality of San Jose, Northern Samar;\" The prosecution had as its witnesses Fe EreÃ±o and Julio EreÃ±o, the wife and brother of the victim respectively, and SPO4 Ricardo Sudio, the deputy chief of police in San Jose, Northern Samar. The defense, on the other hand, presented the accused-appellant himself and his wife Nora AÃ±onuevo.\n\nThe victim, Rufino EreÃ±o, was autopsied the day after the incident, and was found to have succumbed to shock secondary to internal hemorrhage as a result of the gunshot wounds he sustained in different parts of the body, the number, nature and locations of which are detailed in the autopsy report (Exhibit \"A\"). [5]\n\nThe trial court summarized the circumstances surrounding the killing as follows: [6]\n\"At about 7:30 in the evening on March 9, 1993, at a place less than a kilometer from the barangay proper of Tubigdanao, the family of Rufino EreÃ±o was preparing to retire for the night. The husband was lying down on the side of the one-room affair dwelling hut. Their three children ages seven, six and two and a half, were also inside. Fe EreÃ±o was towards the rear of the house at the kitchenâs yard transferring the small pig to a place inside the house for the evening. She was around three or four brazas to where her husband was. It was there that she heard a gunfire from that direction and saw the accused at a distance of around one-half meter to the house and at the side thereof where her husband lay. The accused was around three brazas to her carrying a long gun in fort position as he withdrew and ran away. She dashed inside the house and saw her husband vomiting blood with injuries at the left of the neck and towards the nape. She ran to the barangay poblacion to the house of one Banker Ballesta, the son of the barangay captain who went to the place of the incident. From there, Ballesta motored to the town and notified Julio EreÃ±o, the victimâs younger brother, who, in turn notified the police.  The report was recorded in the police blotter (Exh. \"1\").  It was around 8:00 oâclock in the evening.  The body was brought to the townâs district of P. Tingzon where the grieving widow told Julio EreÃ±o and deputy chief of police Ricardo Sudio of the gun wielder to be the accused.\n\nThe accused is long familiar to the EreÃ±o spouses.  Fe EreÃ±o used to see him whenever he goes to town.  He resides in a farm at another barangay.  She told that her husband was killed because whoever makes copra for Juan AÃ±onuevo, the accusedâs nephew, would be resented by the accused. The victim used to make copra for Juan AÃ±onuevo at the latterâs coconut land.  Other hired hands are residents of Tubigdanao who stopped working for Juan AÃ±onuevo.  She heard that the accused prohibited them from working for Juan.  The victim last made copra in February, the month before his death.\n\nJulio EreÃ±o testified that immediately after Ballesta told him of the shooting of his brother, he notified the police at the municipal hall who recorded his report (Exh. \"1\").  He met Fe EreÃ±o, his sister-in-law, later at P. Tingzon in town.\n\nx x x               x x x                  x x x\nThe accused testified that the victim was a friend and they see each other often. Fe EreÃ±o was also his friend and knows her since she was small.  He branded her accusation as a lie.  On March 9, 1993, in the evening he was at home sleeping with his wife and their small child.  His house is in San Lorenzo, a barangay around five kilometers to the town.  From San Lorenzo to Tubigdanao is around two kilometers accessible only by a footpath and can be negotiated in about ten minutes by walking at a fast pace.  He came to know of the death of Rufino EreÃ±o only on the 24th of March, 1993, when he was told he was subpoenaed.  He was always at home from March 10, 1993, up to his arrest on March 27.  He could not think of any reason as to why Fe EreÃ±o would accuse and testify to impute a crime upon an innocent person.  He claims that the killer was not even identified for Julio EreÃ±o, the victimâs brother, reported to the police that the gunman could not be identified (Exh. \"1\").  Juan AÃ±onuevo is his nephew who owns two parcels of land in San Lorenzo which came from the formerâs father.  His coconut land is situated between these properties of Juan with whom he maintains good relationship.  The victim was only one of those hired to make copra by Juan AÃ±onuevo and the last time he made copra was in February this year. Nora AÃ±onuevo, his wife, vouched for his presence at their home during the whole evening of March 9, 1993.\"\n\nAfter trial, the court a quo rendered judgment as follows:\n\n\"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral, also known as Hanger, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and, with neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances to consider, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, to indemnify the heirs of Rufino EreÃ±o in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.\" The Issues Before this Court, accused-appellant assigns the following errors:[7]\n\n\"I\nThe court a quo erred in giving weight and credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and in disregarding the theory of the defense despite the evidence to the contrary.\n\nII\nThe court a quo erred in convicting accused-appellant notwithstanding the fact that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.\" In his brief, accused-appellant centers his arguments on two main issues: the credibility of the prosecutionâs key witness and the weight to be given the defense of alibi.\n\nThe Courtâs Ruling\n\nFirst Issue: Credibility of Prosecution Witness\nAppellant assails the credibility of the main witness for the prosecution, the victimâs wife Fe EreÃ±o.  Appellant claims Fe EreÃ±o could not have seen her husbandâs assailant, for while she was present at the premises, nevertheless she did not see the actual shooting, as she was at the back of the kitchen busy attending to a piglet, and therefore had no opportunity to get a good view of the assailant.  The defense also laid emphasis on the fact that it was nighttime, and the prosecution had not established taht the victim's house was situated in a place where there were no plants and trees in the surroundings which could have obstructed the moonlight from fully illuminating the scene or which might otherwise have prevented Fe EreÃ±o from seeing the person of the assailant.  Thus, the accused claims, her identification of appellant as her husband's killer is unreliable and untrustworthy.  Her testimony, aside from being biased, is uncorroborated and therefore also insufficient to convict appellant. [8]\n\nWe disagree. The record shows that Fe EreÃ±o was in a position to see her husband's killer. Her testimony was to the effect that her family's dwelling was a small one-room hut. At the time she heard the gunshot, she was in their yard tethering their pig. The yard was near their kitchen, so she was in a good position to see appellant who was at the side of the hut, about three arms-lengths away from her, backing away from the house holding a long firearm in fort position, and then running away. Said she:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q | What were you doing at the time when you were in your house?\nA | I was tethering our pig.\nQ | Where was your pig at that time?\nA | In our yard\n | x x x x x x x x x\nQ | At the time you were tethering your pig where was your husband?\nA | He was lying down inside our house.\nQ | In what part of the house was he lying down?\nA | At the right side.\nQ | Right side of what?\nA | (witness repeating the answer) Right side.\nCOURT: | \nQ | Your house is a one room affair?\nA | Yes, sir.\nFISCAL: | \nQ | And while you were tethering your pig can you remember of any unusual incident that took place?\nA | Yes, sir.\nQ | What happened?\nA | There was an explosion.\nQ | What did you do upon hearing that explosion?\nA | I did not know from where I was standing.\nQ | Where were you standing?\nA | Near our kitchen.\nQ | And what did you observe?\nA | That was it I saw Pedrito.\nQ | Who is that Pedrito?\nA | AÃ±onuevo.\nQ | What was he doing when you saw him?\nA | He was moving backward carrying with him a long gun.\nQ | You said that he was moving backward(,) from where he was he that he was moving backward?\nA | Just near that place where my husband was lying.\n | x x x x x x x x x\nQ | How far were you to Pedrito AÃ±onuevo when you saw him?\nA | About three brazas away.\nQ | And then what did you do next?\nA | I ran inside the house.\nQ | and what did you do xxx what did you discover inside your house?\nA | I saw my husband vomiting already with blood.\nQ | Why?\nA | Because he was shot.\nQ | Uou said that he was shot(,) where was he hit?\nA | He was hit on the left side of his neck (witness indicating the left side of his neck toward he nape).\"[9]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n\"Q What were you doing at the time when you were in your house?

A The moon was in a position of 7:00 o'clock and it came from the east where the sun rises. Q After seeing him where did he go? A He ran away.\" [11] The trial court even made note of the fact that there was a full moon the day prior to the incident, i.e., on March 8, 1993. [12]\n\nFe EreÃ±o was familiar with accused-appellant, and thus easily recognized him.  She testified on direct:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ | How long have you known this Pedrito AÃ±onuevo before that incident?\nA | Long before because we frequently meet on the road.\nCOURT: | \nQ | How often do you meet him on the road?\nA | Always whenever he goes to town.\nQ | You said that he goes to town, why where was he staying?\nA | In the farm.\nQ | Where is that farm?\nA | In San Jose, toward San Lorenzo.\nQ | In whose land?\nA | His own land.\"[13]\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ How long have you known this Pedrito AÃ±onuevo before that incident? A Long before because we frequently meet on the road. COURT: Q How often do you meet him on the road? A Always whenever he goes to town. Q You said that he goes to town, why where was he staying? A In the farm. Q Where is that farm? A In San Jose, toward San Lorenzo. Q In whose land? A His own land.\" [13] During trial, the accused admitted that Fe EreÃ±o knew him just as well as he did her, and so the court a quo observed that, based on the surrounding circumstances, all the opportunities for a positive identification by the sole witness were present in this case.\n\nThe trial court found the testimony of Fe EreÃ±o convincing.  When the credibility of witnesses is at issue, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings and assessments of trial courts. [14] The credibility of witnesses is a matter best assessed by the trial court which had observed their demeanor and deportment during trial. [15] Findings of trial courts regarding the veracity of a testimony are given great weight and accorded high respect by this Court in the absence of a showing that they were reached arbitrarily. [16] We will not disturb these findings unless there is a clear showing that facts or circumstances of weight or substance have been overlooked or misunderstood which could affect the result of the case. [17] Appellant has not presented any reason why this case should be an exception to the general rule.\n\nAppellant claims Fe EreÃ±o failed to identify her husband's assailant to the police, and that the shooting was recorded in the police blotter on March 9, 1993 with the suspect unnamed and unidentified. [18] However the testimonies of prosecution witnesses reveal that it was Julio EreÃ±o, the victim's brother, who first reported the incident to the police, and at the time he did so, he did not yet know who the assailant of his brother was. [19] When Fe EreÃ±o was investigated on the same night of the shooting, she immediately identified appellant as her husband's killer. [20] This was established by the testimony of the Deputy Chief of Police who declared that Fe EreÃ±o revealed to him the accused as the killer upon their return to the town that night. [21]\n\nFe EreÃ±o's identification of appellant is sufficient to convict him. It has repeatedly been held that the testimony of a single eyewitness if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court as to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to convict. [22]\n\nAppellant, instead of introducing evidence to show that Fe EreÃ±o had motive to testify falsely against him, even admitted that she had no reason to wrongly accuse him of the death of her husband. [23] The testimony of Fe EreÃ±o cannot be denied credence just because she happened to be the victim's wife.  Mere relationship of a witness to the victim does not automatically impair his credibility and render his testimony less worthy of credence where no improper motive can be ascribed to him for testifying. [24] Rather, the witness' relationship to the victim, far from rendering her testimony biased, would even make it more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in seeking justice for the deceased to accuse somebody other than the real culprit. [25]\n\nSecond Issue: Is the Alibi Airtight?\nIn the face of the overwhelming evidence against him, appellant relies on the defense of alibi.  He testified that he was at home sleeping with his wife and their young child when the shooting was committed.  His wife corroborated his story, claiming that her husband was with her at home the whole night of March 9, 1993, and he never left the house. [26] The accused-appellant also claims he had no motive to kill Rufino EreÃ±o, insisting that the victim was his friend and that they knew each other quite well. [27]\n\nThe rule is well-settled that in order for the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the offense was committed but it must likewise be demonstrated that he was so far away that it was not possible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. [28]\n\"Alibi, the plea of having been elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission of the felony, is a plausible excuse for the accused.  Let there be no mistake about it.  Contrary to the common notion, alibi is in fact a good defense.  But to be valid for purposes of exoneration from a criminal charge, the defense of alibi must be such that it would have been physically impossible for the person charged with the crime to be at the locus criminis at the time of its commission, the reason being that no person can be in two places at the same time.  The excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception.  Where there is the least posibility of accused's presence at the crime scene, the alibi will not hold water.\" (underscoring ours) [29] In this case, appellant admitted that the place where the crime was committed could be reached from his place in approximately 10 to 20 minutes on foot.  He said:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q | How far is Tubigdanao to your house in San Lorenzo?\nA | It could be around two kilometers away.\nQ | How many minutes would it take to negotiate from Tubigdanao to your house?\nA | It could be around 20 minutes because there is no road in going there and you have only to hike, but if one is fast in walking it would only take around 10 minutes.\nQ | Is there a footpath?\nA | Yes, sir.\"[30]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n\"Q How far is Tubigdanao to your house in San Lorenzo? A It could be around two kilometers away. Q How many minutes would it take to negotiate from Tubigdanao to your house? A It could be around 20 minutes because there is no road in going there and you have only to hike, but if one is fast in walking it would only take around 10 minutes. Q Is there a footpath? A Yes, sir.\" [30] In light of the foregoing testimony, the trial court certainly could not be faulted for not giving weight to accused-appellant's alibi. Besides being inherently weak for not being airtight, accused's alibi cannot prevail as against the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses. [31] Likewise, the testimony of appellant's wife is of little value to his defense, as it only corroborates his leaky alibi. Also, alibi has been held to become less plausible as a defense when it is mainly established by the accused himself and his immediate relatives. [32]\n\nHis defense of lack of motive will likewise not prosper, as motive is immaterial where there is direct testimony of a credible witness and where the culpability of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt. [33] In any event, the trial court held that \"(i)t is not that there is want of any motive at all for the killing\", preferring to believe Fe EreÃ±o's testimony to the effect that the accused had threatened the workers who made copra for accused's nephew Juan AÃ±onuevo, and had told them he would treat them as his (accused's) enemies.  Everyone but the victim desisted from making copra for Juan AÃ±onuevo; the victim last worked in February, the month before he was killed.\n\nTreachery Not Proven However, although the trial court observed that:\n\n\"The killing is characterized by the treacherous manner it was perpetrated x x x.  The victim certainly had no opportunity to defend himself and he was in no position to mount any defensive maneuver such as would subject the accused to any risk.  Killing a sleeping victim was considered an example par excellence of the crime qualified by treachery (citing People vs. Curatchia, 97 SCRA 549 and People vs. Pajanustan, 97 SCRA 699) and the circumstance surrounding the shooting of Rufino EreÃ±o assumes no less consideration even without it being positively shown that he was aslept (sic).\" [34] the evidence fails to show that appellant's attack on Rufino EreÃ±o was committed with treachery.  The most that can be said in this case is that the victim was reclining at one side of his one-room dwelling hut when he was shot, with the killer firing from outside the hut.  There was no evidence, not even from the testimony of Fe EreÃ±o, that the victim was asleep, or that his back was turned to the accused when the latter fired the shot, or was otherwise in a defenseless position.  All that Fe EreÃ±o saw was her husband vomiting blood.  It is elementary that alevosia, to be appreciated, must be proven as clearly as the elements of the crime or crimes it is alleged to qualify.  This the prosecution had failed to do.  It should have proven that the accused had consciously and deliberately employed a form of attack to ensure the consummation of his objective without risk to himself from any defense the person assaulted could have made. [35] This cannot be said to have been done in the instant case.  On the other hand, the trial court ruled out evident premeditation for lack of evidence, to which we agree.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED, in that the accused-appellant Pedrito AÃ±onuevo y Boral is found GUILTY of the crime of HOMICIDE, and that the penalty imposed upon him is the indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of prision mayor as minimum penalty, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal in its medium period, there being no aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as maximum penalty.  The P50,000.00 civil indemnity for the victim's death is hereby AFFIRMED, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.  No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nNarvasa, C.J., (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Melo, and Francisco, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Regional Trial Court, 8th Judicial Region, Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar, presided by Judge Cesar R.
