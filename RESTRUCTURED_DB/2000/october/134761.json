This Court finds the accused AGUINALDO CATUIRAN, JR., REY DELA CRUZ, JUSELITO DE PEDRO, AND REYNALDO CATUIRAN GUILTY as principal (sic) of the crime of Homicide, without mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and they are hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of EIGHT (8) years, and ONE (1) DAY OF PRISION MAYOR as minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY OF RECLUSION TEMPORAL as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of Joefredo Tulio the sum of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs;\"2.

That a separate trial would be conducted for the accused RAMON PATRICIO, JR.\"[2]From the above judgment, the accused went on appeal to the Court of Appeals.The Court of Appeals, through Justice Ricardo P. Galvez concurred in by Justice Pedro A. Ramirez and Justice B. A. Adefuin-dela Cruz, in its decision, dated 31 January 1997, affirmed the trial court but, finding the attendance of treachery in the commission of the crime, the appellate court adjudged:\"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is hereby MODIFIED as to the nature of the offense committed. As MODIFIED, We find accused-appellants Elmer dela Cruz, Fernando Lavarosa, Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., Reynaldo Catuiran, Rey dela Cruz, Ricardo de Pedro and Juselito de Pedro guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and are each sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months of Reclusion Temporal as minimum to Reclusion Perpetua as maximum, with the corresponding accessory penalties as provided by law and to pay the costs. The preventive imprisonment which the accused had already undergone shall be credited in their favor in the service of their sentence, in accordance with, and subject to the conditions and exceptions laid down in Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 6127.\"[3]The motion for reconsideration filed by accused-appellants before the appellate court was denied in its resolution of 29 June 1998.The statement of the case and the relevant facts introduced at the trial before the court a quo have been culled by the Court of Appeals in this wise; viz:\"At the trial on the merits, the prosecution, through its witnesses Dr. Ronnie Payba, Cpl. Teofilo Martesano, Henry Candelario, Isidro Peniano, Ricky Vedasto, Flocerfida Tulio Inocencio and Ana May Tulio-Garmino, established the following facts: that at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening of November 4, 1983, a benefit dance sponsored by the Barangay Tanod was being held in an improvised dance hall located at Barangay Lupo, Altavas, Aklan. The place was well-lit. There were many people who attended the festivities including deceased Joefredo Tulio, the above accused, namely, Elmer De la Cruz, Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., Rey dela Cruz, Juselito de Pedro, Ricardo de Pedro, Fernando Lavarosa, Reynaldo Catuiran and Ramon Patricio, Jr., and the witnesses Peniano, Candelario and Vedasto, all of whom were residents of Lupo, Altavas, Aklan. Between the hours of 2:00 o'clock and 3:00 o'clock in the morning of the following day, while the dance was in progress, Isidro Peniano saw Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr. placed his arm over the shoulder of Joefredo Tulio, apparently in an friendly gesture. Later, Catuiran unsuspectingly led Tulio outside the dance hall. Peniano, through the illumination of light from the electric post, noticed that while the two were walking along a path from the hall leading to the street and towards the direction of Catuiran's house, which was a few meters away from the said hall, Catuiran suddenly pulled out his knife and thrust the same at the surprised victim hitting the latter's chest for four (4) times. Tulio struggled with his attacker for the possession of the weapon but his efforts proved futile so, he ran away. Peniano recounted having seen a group of men, later identified as Elmer de la Cruz, Juselito de Pedro, Rey de la Cruz, Ricardo de Pedro and Fernando Lavarosa on the road which was about twenty-five meters away from the said dance hall, apparently waiting for somebody. Only, it turned out to be Joefredo Tulio. As Tulio was fleeing from Catuiran, he was blocked by this group and thereafter stabbed by Juselito de Pedro and Rey de la Cruz. The others, in turn, kicked him and boxed him several times until the victim fell into a canal. They then carried the prostrate body of Tulio to a nearby ricefield, where they left the victim's body. As soon as these men had left the field and while proceeding towards the dance hall, one of them was heard saying `ma-surrender kami.' At this juncture, Reynaldo Catuiran, came rushing to the ricefield where Tulio was seen lying. Not satisfied with the wounds and injuries sustained by Tulio, Catuiran unsheathed his bolo and hacked the former with it. In consequence of the assault, Tulio sustained twenty-nine (29) wounds on the different parts of his body. Peniano's narration was corroborated by Ricky Vedasto, who was familiar with all the accused, and by Henry Candelario, who testified having last seen Joefredo Tulio alive in the company of accused Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr.\"The accused interposed the defense of alibi by claiming that they were somewhere else during the stabbing incident. While admitting that they did attend the dance that very night, Fernando Lavarosa, Rey de la Cruz, Juselito de Pedro and Ricardo de Pedro claim that they left the dance hall between the hours of 10:30 and 12:00 o'clock in the evening of November 4, 1983 and slept till 5:00 o'clock to 6:30 the following morning. For their part, the Catuiran brothers, Reynaldo and Aguinaldo, Jr., maintained that they never left the dance hall that night until 3:30 a.m. of November 5, 1983.[4]The principal point raised by accused-appellants in the instant petition relates to the credibility of the witnesses. Accused-appellants vehemently assail the appreciation made by both the trial court and the appellate court of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and point to the prosecution witnesses as being the real assailants.It is doctrinal that the evaluation by the trial court on the credibility of witnesses is accorded the highest respect on the thesis that it is the trial court, rather than the appellate court, which has an unrestrained and unparalleled opportunity to observe directly their demeanor and determine the veracity of their testimony. Such an assessment is almost invariably binding on this Court unless it finds such assessment to have been reached arbitrarily or, as so often said, when the trial court has evidently overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the case.[5] The rule becomes even more pronounced than usual when the trial court is sustained by the Court of Appeals in the latter's own review.It might be important to take special note of the fact that accused-appellants were positively identified to be the assailant of Joefredo Tulio not just by a single witness, whose lone testimony could have even sufficed to support a conviction for murder,[6] but by three witnesses who were not shown to have had any strong motive to testify falsely against the accused.Eyewitness Isidro Peniano positively identified accused-appellants and gave a straightforward and unequivocal account of the stabbing incident that could only inspire belief. \"Q. Now, you said that at around 2:00 A.M. you were proceeding to the dance hall but you were prevented while you were on the street because you saw a commotion, can you tell us if . . (Unfinished.)

No, you testified earlier that the auditorium is that found in Exhibit `D-1' which is marked as Exhibit `D-1-b.' You again testified that you saw the stabbing incident by reason of the light coming from the auditorium. Can you tell us where was that light coming from if shown to you the picture that you identified a while ago as the auditorium? \"A. (Witness is shown looking at the picture and pointed to a portion on the picture where he said there was a post which a sound system was installed. \"Q.

(Witness placed his arm over the right shoulder of the Court employee simulated as Tulio and with the left hand of the witness demonstrating by raising his left hand and stabbed him on the left breast. \"x x x x x x x x x. \"ATTORNEY CASTUCIANO: \"Q. How many times? \"A. Four times. \"Q. Seeing this stabbing movement of Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr. on the person of Jeofredo Tulio with the knife, what did Jeofredo Tulio do, if any? \"A. He tried to wrestle the knife but he was not able to do it, so he ran away. \"x x x x x x x x x. \"ATTORNEY CASTUCIANO: \"Q. How many persons stabbed Jeofredo Tulio? \"COURT: Witness may answer. \"WITNESS: \"A. Two persons. \"ATTORNEY CASTUCIANO: \"Q. You mentioned already one. Who was the other one who stabbed him? \"A. Juselito de Pedro. \"Q. If Rey dela Cruz is here, just stand up and point Rey dela Cruz. \"COURT: Let him go down the witness stand. \"WITNESS: \"A.

That is his right to remain silent. \"ATTORNEY CASTUCIANO: The right to remain silent is only available to a person when he is being investigated or being presented as a witness under direct or cross-examination. And the same is not available to a person when his identity is being asked for the sake of clarification, identification and to whereby the Court arrives at a precise conclusion as to the identity of the person. The right of self-incrimination is not available to the person whose identification is being asked. So, for purposes of identification, your Honor Please, I beg that the accused identified by the witness may give his name. We know precisely that this has been an acceptable practice for purposes of identification so that the Court may not be misled and be guided to conclude. \"ATTORNEY RAZ: May I know if he was naming? Has he named the accused? \"COURT: Yes. You ask him if he is Rey dela Cruz. \"INTERPRETER: (The accused was asked if he is Rey dela Cruz and he stood up and answered `Yes, sir.') \"ATTORNEY CASTUCIANO: \"Q.

He drew his bolo and boloed Tulio once. \"Q. At the time that you saw this act of hacking or boloing, what was the position of Jeofredo Tulio, was he standing, lying or sitting? \"A. He was lying.[8] Eyewitness Henry Candelario, a nephew of accused-appellant Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., corroborated Peniano and Vedasto. He testified that the victim was last seen alive when the latter, together with accused-appellant Catuiran, Jr., left the dance hall towards the street, near the place where the victim's body was later found.[9]No plausible reasons have been shown that would have impelled the prosecution witnesses to testify falsely against accused-appellants.[10] The mere allegation that the eyewitnesses are relatives of the victim cannot be a valid ground for denying probative value to their testimony.[11] Indeed, if there are persons more interested and concerned than anyone else in vindicating the death of the victim and bringing to justice the real perpetrators of the crime, they would be the relatives of the victim themselves.In professing their innocence, and denying involvement in the crime, accused-appellants would insist on their alibi, asseverating that they had left the dance hall between the hours of 10:30 and 12:00 in the evening of 04 November 1983 for their respective houses. For the defense of alibi to prosper, an accused should prove, not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but that also it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity.[12] The respective places where accused-appellants claimed to be at the time of the incident were just some distance away from the scene of the crime.In any case, the positive identification of accused-appellants as being the perpetrators of the crime has virtually demolished their alibi.[13] Positive identification by eye-witnesses, when categorical and where no ill-motive is shown, definitely prevails over alibi and denial. No jurisprudence in criminal law is perhaps more settled than that alibi and denial, unless substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is undeserving of weight[14] and is thus normally discarded.[15]Treachery has attended the killing of the victim and qualified the offense to murder. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.[16] The essence of treachery is a swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim.[17]Evidently, the victim was totally unaware of the intention of the accused-appellants to kill him. In fact, in a friendly gesture, accused-appellant Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., had placed his arms around the shoulder of the victim and led him outside the dance hall where he was suddenly stabbed several times on the chest with no real opportunity to defend himself. The twenty-nine stab and hack wounds sustained by the victim would indicate nothing less than that accused-appellants had consciously, deliberately, and manifestly employed means to insure the death of the victim without risk to themselves. The qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, even if extant, was absorbed by treachery.[18]The concerted acts of accused-appellants established the existence of conspiracy among them. Their concordant conduct during the attack, manifested by their coordinated acts and movements, in the killing of the victim was a clear manifestation of their joint purpose and design, as well as community of interest, in the perpetration of the crime.[19] The narration made by eyewitness Isidro Peniano could only characterize a unity of purpose, intent and design of all accused-appellants. \"Q. Now, how many seconds or how many minutes or how long a time did the stabbing, kicking and boxing incident occur? \"A. May be ten seconds. \"Q. And then what happened next? \"A. Joefredo fell on a canal. And they carried him and brought him to the riceland. \"Q. Who carried Joefredo Tulio to the ricefield? \"A. All of them. \"Q. When you said, `them,' to whom are you referring to? \"A. Elmer dela Cruz, Ramon Patricio, Juselito de Pedro, Rey dela Cruz, Ricardo de Pedro, Fernando Lavarosa. \"Q. From the road or from the canal where Joefredo Tulio fell to the riceland where Joefredo Tulio was brought by these persons you mentioned, how far or what is the distance of this place? \"A. May be seven arms stretch. \"Q. Upon reaching the riceland, what happened next? \"A. They buried him and stepped on him `tapac.' \"Q. When you said, `buried,' how deep was he buried? \"A. Only shallow. \"Q. From the place where you were standing to the place where according to you Joefredo Tulio was buried, would you be able to see the body of Joefredo Tulio? \"A. Yes, sir. \"Q. For how long a time did they step on the body of Joefredo Tulio? \"A. May be for three seconds.\"[20]Where conspiracy has been adequately shown, the precise modality or extent of participation of each individual conspirator becomes but secondary since the applicable rule is that the act of one conspirator shall be deemed to be the act of all of them.[21]The crime having been committed in 1983, the penalty prescribed in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code prior to its amendment by Republic Act No. 7659,[22] being slightly more lenient than that expressed in the later enactment, should apply. The penalty for murder under the then Article 248 was reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death. There being neither ordinary mitigating nor ordinary aggravating circumstance proved, the penalty that could be imposed on accused-appellants would be its medium period, or reclusion perpetua, pursuant to Article 64(1) of the Revised Penal Code.Quite unfortunately for accused-appellants, the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103, as amended) cannot be used. Section 1 of the law states that \"(i)n imposing a prison sentence for an offense punished by the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and the minimum which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense.\" In determining whether an indeterminate sentence, and not a straight penalty, will apply, what matters is not the penalty prescribed by law but the penalty that can actually be imposed by the trial court after considering the attendant circumstances.[23] Once it is established that the Indeterminate Sentence Law can apply, the penalty next lower (for the minimum term) is then computed on the basis of the penalty prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the offense without considering any modifying circumstance attendant to the commission of the crime which circumstances would be considered in the imposition of the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence.[24] Since the penalty that can be imposed in the instant case is reclusion perpetua, as hereinbefore discussed, the exclusionary clauses of the Indeterminate Sentence Law preclude its application to the situation of accused-appellants.Pursuant to the latest jurisprudence, the civil indemnity for the death of the victim should be increased to P50,000.00.WHEREFORE, the conviction of accused-appellants ELMER DE LA CRUZ, FERNANDO LAVAROSA, AGUINALDO CATUIRAN, JR., REYNALDO CATUIRAN, REY DE LA CRUZ, RICARDO DE PEDRO, and JUSELITO DE PEDRO by the appellate court for the crime of MURDER is AFFIRMED but the sentence is now hereby MODIFIED by imposing on each of them the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. Accused-appellants are also ordered to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of Joefredo Tulio the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity.

This Court finds the accused AGUINALDO CATUIRAN, JR., REY DELA CRUZ, JUSELITO DE PEDRO, AND REYNALDO CATUIRAN GUILTY as principal (sic) of the crime of Homicide, without mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and they are hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of EIGHT (8) years, and ONE (1) DAY OF PRISION MAYOR as minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY OF RECLUSION TEMPORAL as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of Joefredo Tulio the sum of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs;\n\n\"2.

That a separate trial would be conducted for the accused RAMON PATRICIO, JR.\" [2]\nFrom the above judgment, the accused went on appeal to the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, through Justice Ricardo P. Galvez concurred in by Justice Pedro A. Ramirez and Justice B. A. Adefuin-dela Cruz, in its decision, dated 31 January 1997, affirmed the trial court but, finding the attendance of treachery in the commission of the crime, the appellate court adjudged:\n\"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is hereby MODIFIED as to the nature of the offense committed. As MODIFIED, We find accused-appellants Elmer dela Cruz, Fernando Lavarosa, Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., Reynaldo Catuiran, Rey dela Cruz, Ricardo de Pedro and Juselito de Pedro guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and are each sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months of Reclusion Temporal as minimum to Reclusion Perpetua as maximum, with the corresponding accessory penalties as provided by law and to pay the costs. The preventive imprisonment which the accused had already undergone shall be credited in their favor in the service of their sentence, in accordance with, and subject to the conditions and exceptions laid down in Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 6127.\" [3]\nThe motion for reconsideration filed by accused-appellants before the appellate court was denied in its resolution of 29 June 1998.\n\nThe statement of the case and the relevant facts introduced at the trial before the court a quo have been culled by the Court of Appeals in this wise; viz :\n\"At the trial on the merits, the prosecution, through its witnesses Dr. Ronnie Payba, Cpl. Teofilo Martesano, Henry Candelario, Isidro Peniano, Ricky Vedasto, Flocerfida Tulio Inocencio and Ana May Tulio-Garmino, established the following facts: that at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening of November 4, 1983, a benefit dance sponsored by the Barangay Tanod was being held in an improvised dance hall located at Barangay Lupo, Altavas, Aklan. The place was well-lit. There were many people who attended the festivities including deceased Joefredo Tulio, the above accused, namely, Elmer De la Cruz, Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., Rey dela Cruz, Juselito de Pedro, Ricardo de Pedro, Fernando Lavarosa, Reynaldo Catuiran and Ramon Patricio, Jr., and the witnesses Peniano, Candelario and Vedasto, all of whom were residents of Lupo, Altavas, Aklan. Between the hours of 2:00 o'clock and 3:00 o'clock in the morning of the following day, while the dance was in progress, Isidro Peniano saw Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr. placed his arm over the shoulder of Joefredo Tulio, apparently in an friendly gesture. Later, Catuiran unsuspectingly led Tulio outside the dance hall. Peniano, through the illumination of light from the electric post, noticed that while the two were walking along a path from the hall leading to the street and towards the direction of Catuiran's house, which was a few meters away from the said hall, Catuiran suddenly pulled out his knife and thrust the same at the surprised victim hitting the latter's chest for four (4) times. Tulio struggled with his attacker for the possession of the weapon but his efforts proved futile so, he ran away. Peniano recounted having seen a group of men, later identified as Elmer de la Cruz, Juselito de Pedro, Rey de la Cruz, Ricardo de Pedro and Fernando Lavarosa on the road which was about twenty-five meters away from the said dance hall, apparently waiting for somebody. Only, it turned out to be Joefredo Tulio. As Tulio was fleeing from Catuiran, he was blocked by this group and thereafter stabbed by Juselito de Pedro and Rey de la Cruz. The others, in turn, kicked him and boxed him several times until the victim fell into a canal. They then carried the prostrate body of Tulio to a nearby ricefield, where they left the victim's body. As soon as these men had left the field and while proceeding towards the dance hall, one of them was heard saying `ma-surrender kami.' At this juncture, Reynaldo Catuiran, came rushing to the ricefield where Tulio was seen lying. Not satisfied with the wounds and injuries sustained by Tulio, Catuiran unsheathed his bolo and hacked the former with it. In consequence of the assault, Tulio sustained twenty-nine (29) wounds on the different parts of his body. Peniano's narration was corroborated by Ricky Vedasto, who was familiar with all the accused, and by Henry Candelario, who testified having last seen Joefredo Tulio alive in the company of accused Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr.\n\n\"The accused interposed the defense of alibi by claiming that they were somewhere else during the stabbing incident. While admitting that they did attend the dance that very night, Fernando Lavarosa, Rey de la Cruz, Juselito de Pedro and Ricardo de Pedro claim that they left the dance hall between the hours of 10:30 and 12:00 o'clock in the evening of November 4, 1983 and slept till 5:00 o'clock to 6:30 the following morning. For their part, the Catuiran brothers, Reynaldo and Aguinaldo, Jr., maintained that they never left the dance hall that night until 3:30 a.m. of November 5, 1983. [4]\nThe principal point raised by accused-appellants in the instant petition relates to the credibility of the witnesses. Accused-appellants vehemently assail the appreciation made by both the trial court and the appellate court of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and point to the prosecution witnesses as being the real assailants.\n\nIt is doctrinal that the evaluation by the trial court on the credibility of witnesses is accorded the highest respect on the thesis that it is the trial court, rather than the appellate court, which has an unrestrained and unparalleled opportunity to observe directly their demeanor and determine the veracity of their testimony. Such an assessment is almost invariably binding on this Court unless it finds such assessment to have been reached arbitrarily or, as so often said, when the trial court has evidently overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the case. [5] The rule becomes even more pronounced than usual when the trial court is sustained by the Court of Appeals in the latter's own review.\n\nIt might be important to take special note of the fact that accused-appellants were positively identified to be the assailant of Joefredo Tulio not just by a single witness, whose lone testimony could have even sufficed to support a conviction for murder, [6] but by three witnesses who were not shown to have had any strong motive to testify falsely against the accused.\n\nEyewitness Isidro Peniano positively identified accused-appellants and gave a straightforward and unequivocal account of the stabbing incident that could only inspire belief.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q. | Now, you said that at around 2:00 A.M. you were proceeding to the dance hall but you were prevented while you were on the street because you saw a commotion, can you tell us if . .

[8] Eyewitness Henry Candelario, a nephew of accused-appellant Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., corroborated Peniano and Vedasto. He testified that the victim was last seen alive when the latter, together with accused-appellant Catuiran, Jr., left the dance hall towards the street, near the place where the victim's body was later found. [9]\n\nNo plausible reasons have been shown that would have impelled the prosecution witnesses to testify falsely against accused-appellants. [10] The mere allegation that the eyewitnesses are relatives of the victim cannot be a valid ground for denying probative value to their testimony. [11] Indeed, if there are persons more interested and concerned than anyone else in vindicating the death of the victim and bringing to justice the real perpetrators of the crime, they would be the relatives of the victim themselves.\n\nIn professing their innocence, and denying involvement in the crime, accused-appellants would insist on their alibi , asseverating that they had left the dance hall between the hours of 10:30 and 12:00 in the evening of 04 November 1983 for their respective houses. For the defense of alibi to prosper, an accused should prove, not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but that also it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity. [12] The respective places where accused-appellants claimed to be at the time of the incident were just some distance away from the scene of the crime.\n\nIn any case, the positive identification of accused-appellants as being the perpetrators of the crime has virtually demolished their alibi . [13] Positive identification by eye-witnesses, when categorical and where no ill-motive is shown, definitely prevails over alibi and denial. No jurisprudence in criminal law is perhaps more settled than that alibi and denial, unless substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is undeserving of weight [14] and is thus normally discarded. [15]\n\nTreachery has attended the killing of the victim and qualified the offense to murder. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make. [16] The essence of treachery is a swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim. [17]\n\nEvidently, the victim was totally unaware of the intention of the accused-appellants to kill him. In fact, in a friendly gesture, accused-appellant Aguinaldo Catuiran, Jr., had placed his arms around the shoulder of the victim and led him outside the dance hall where he was suddenly stabbed several times on the chest with no real opportunity to defend himself. The twenty-nine stab and hack wounds sustained by the victim would indicate nothing less than that accused-appellants had consciously, deliberately, and manifestly employed means to insure the death of the victim without risk to themselves. The qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, even if extant, was absorbed by treachery. [18]\n\nThe concerted acts of accused-appellants established the existence of conspiracy among them. Their concordant conduct during the attack, manifested by their coordinated acts and movements, in the killing of the victim was a clear manifestation of their joint purpose and design, as well as community of interest, in the perpetration of the crime. [19] The narration made by eyewitness Isidro Peniano could only characterize a unity of purpose, intent and design of all accused-appellants.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q. | Now, how many seconds or how many minutes or how long a time did the stabbing, kicking and boxing incident occur?\n | \n\"A. | May be ten seconds.\n | \n\"Q. | And then what happened next?\n | \n\"A. | Joefredo fell on a canal.

[21]\n\nThe crime having been committed in 1983, the penalty prescribed in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code prior to its amendment by Republic Act No. 7659, [22] being slightly more lenient than that expressed in the later enactment, should apply. The penalty for murder under the then Article 248 was reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death. There being neither ordinary mitigating nor ordinary aggravating circumstance proved, the penalty that could be imposed on accused-appellants would be its medium period, or reclusion perpetua , pursuant to Article 64(1) of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nQuite unfortunately for accused-appellants, the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103, as amended) cannot be used. Section 1 of the law states that \"(i)n imposing a prison sentence for an offense punished by the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and the minimum which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense.\" In determining whether an indeterminate sentence, and not a straight penalty, will apply, what matters is not the penalty prescribed by law but the penalty that can actually be imposed by the trial court after considering the attendant circumstances. [23] Once it is established that the Indeterminate Sentence Law can apply, the penalty next lower (for the minimum term) is then computed on the basis of the penalty prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the offense without considering any modifying circumstance attendant to the commission of the crime which circumstances would be considered in the imposition of the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence. [24] Since the penalty that can be imposed in the instant case is reclusion perpetua , as hereinbefore discussed, the exclusionary clauses of the Indeterminate Sentence Law preclude its application to the situation of accused-appellants.\n\nPursuant to the latest jurisprudence, the civil indemnity for the death of the victim should be increased to P50,000.00.\n\nWHEREFORE, the conviction of accused-appellants ELMER DE LA CRUZ, FERNANDO LAVAROSA, AGUINALDO CATUIRAN, JR., REYNALDO CATUIRAN, REY DE LA CRUZ, RICARDO DE PEDRO, and JUSELITO DE PEDRO by the appellate court for the crime of MURDER is AFFIRMED but the sentence is now hereby MODIFIED by imposing on each of them the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua . Accused-appellants are also ordered to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of Joefredo Tulio the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity.
