MARIANO.\n\n\"CONTRARY TO LAW.\n\n\"City of San Pablo, March 21, 1997.\n\n\"(Sgd.) PERLA D. ABRIL-PAWANG\nAssistant City Prosecutor\" The Facts\n\nI. The first attempt:\n\nOne night a few weeks after Jenalyn's mother left for London on August 9, 1992, then ten year-old Jenalyn was at home with her father, herein accused, and her brother, Ronald, in a rented house at Block 14, Lot 24, NHA, Barangay Sto. Angel in San Pablo City. While accused was drinking gin, he called both Jenalyn and Ronald and ordered each to drink a glass of gin. Since accused look irritated at them and both were afraid of their father who would spank them for no apparent reason, they drank gin as ordered. Accused then told them to sleep in the \"sala.\" As instructed, they slept on a mat in the \"sala.\" Accused joined them and slept between Jenalyn and Ronald. Jenalyn fell asleep immediately. [6]\n\nAt ten o'clock later that night, Jenalyn was stirred from her deep slumber by the movements of accused. Jenalyn was shocked to see her father naked. He was kneeling in front of her and his penis was touching her vagina. She no longer wore her panty. Accused's hands were mashing her pre-pubescent breast and he was forcibly introducing his penis in her vagina. Jenalyn struggled hard against accused, trying to remove accused's hands and to move aside his legs. Accused desperately tried to insert his penis into her vagina but could not. Then, accused masturbated. Jenalyn covered herself with a blanket and tried to sleep but was unable to do so at once, not only for fear that accused might rape her but likewise because she felt unbearable pain in her vagina. [7]\n\nAt around seven o'clock the next morning, Jenalyn woke up. She saw accused beside her, fast asleep. She got up, went to the toilet and urinated. Her vagina was still painful. She cleaned and washed her vagina. Jenalyn did not tell anybody about what the accused did to her because she was afraid of him since every time accused was drunk, he would warn them that he would kill them next to the others he had killed before. [8]\n\nII. The second attempt:\n\nThe second attempt occurred in September 1996. At that time, Jenalyn was living with her aunt, Sonia M. Flor, accused's older sister, and her aunt's two children at Block 14, Lot 27, NHA, Barangay Sto. Angel, San Pablo City. Accused was likewise staying there. Accused and Jenalyn occupied the extension room located at the back of Sonia's house. [9]\n\nOne night in September 1996, at around ten o'clock in the evening, accused, who was very drunk, ordered Jenalyn to sleep in the extension room. Jenalyn obeyed her father as he was drunk and she was afraid to cross him. Accused once again said the names of persons he killed. Jenalyn was half-asleep as she was afraid that accused might attempt to rape her again. Accused took off his pants when he came into the room. Wearing only his brief, he laid down on a folding bed where Jenalyn lay. He smoked a cigarette and placed a knife on a table. [10]\n\nAfter he smoked one cigarette, accused removed the pillows by Jenalyn's side and entered the mosquito net which covered Jenalyn's side of the bed. Accused took off Jenalyn's \"porontong\" shorts and panty and placed himself on top of her. Jenalyn wanted to call out for help but accused poked the knife at her. Accused then tried to insert his penis into her vagina. Jenalyn struggled and kicked the accused. She felt accused's penis on her vagina. However, the penis was not able to penetrate Jenalyn's vagina. Accused stood up and masturbated until he ejaculated. [11]\n\nIII. The third try:\n\nOn February 2, 1997, accused wanted to rape Jenalyn for the third time. Jenalyn and accused were still staying at the extension room of the same house of Sonia M. Flor in San Pablo City. While Jenalyn and her two cousins, Abigail and Iris, were watching the Sunday noontime show called ASAP, accused came home after a drinking spree and proceeded to the extension room. He summoned Jenalyn by whistling at her. Afraid of her father, Jenalyn went to him. Accused told Jenalyn to lie down on the folding bed and sleep. Jenalyn obeyed him since accused was drunk and she was terrified. Accused took off his trousers and placed his knife on top of the cabinet where he kept his clothes. Jenalyn tried to sleep but could not as accused was talking and telling her that he had already changed his ways and that \"malapit na akong mamatay.\" [12]\n\nClad in his brief, accused took the knife on top of the cabinet and placed himself on top of Jenalyn. He took off Jenalyn's pants and panty and, with his brief lowered to his knees, tried to insert his penis into her vagina. As accused tried to force his penis into Jenalyn's vagina, she felt \"as if something has been broken or turning apart (sic).\" Jenalyn struggled against accused and tried to kick him off. Accused's penis was not able to penetrate Jenalyn's vagina, as his sex organ was big. He then stood up and masturbated until he ejaculated. [13]\n\nAfter the third attempted rape and Jenalyn could no longer stand the acts of her father, Jenalyn went to see her aunt, Rosario Fernandez Concepcion, a sister of her mother, and confided to her aunt what the accused had done to her. When Rosario asked Jenalyn why she divulged the incidents only then, she answered that it was because she was afraid. Jenalyn's aunt brought her to the police, who investigated her and took her statement. [14]\n\nThe Arraignment and Plea\n\nOn September 16, 1997, the trial court arraigned the accused. [15] Assisted by counsel de oficio , he pleaded \"not guilty\" to each count of rape. [16] Thereafter, a joint trial of the three cases on the merits ensued. [17]\n\nThe Trial\n\nThe prosecution presented evidence, principally the testimony of the victim, Jenalyn F. Mariano, which established the factual narration above. We quote:\n\nOn the first attempted rape committed on August 19, 1992:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"ATTY. QUINTOS\n | \n\"Q | On August 19, 1992 where were you residing?\n\"A | At Block 14 Lot 24 NHA, Brgy.

[19] On the third rape try committed on February 2, 1997, again we quote Jenalyn's testimony:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n | \"xxx xxx xxx\n | \n\"Q | On February 2, 1997, where were you?\n\"A | In the house of my aunt, and we were viewing television.\n | \n | \"xxx xxx xxx\n | \n\"Q | While you were there was there an unusual incident that happened between you and your father?\n\"A | Yes, sir.\n | \n\"Q | What was that?\n\"A | When he arrived, he removed his long pants and again he was carrying a knife and he placed his knife on top of a cabinet where he used to place his clothes.\n | \n | \"xxx xxx xxx\n | \n\"Q | And then what did he do?\n\"A | \"Pinatungan niya ako.\"\n | \n\"Q | What happened to the long pants you were wearing?\n\"A | He removed it?\n | \n\"Q | And what happened to your pants?\n\"A | He also removed it.\n | \n\"Q | What happened after that?\n\"A | \"Pinatungan niya ako.\"\n | \n\"Q | What happened when he placed himself on top of you?\n\"A | Again he made a \"kakanyog-kanyog movement again, when he wasnot ableto insert his penis he stood up and masturbated and then I saw a white substance came out from his penis.\n | \n | \"xxx xxx xxx\n | \n\"Q | How long was he on top of you?\n\"A | It was fact (sic), because it could not penetrate, because his penis was big.\"[20]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n\"xxx xxx xxx \"Q On February 2, 1997, where were you? \"A In the house of my aunt, and we were viewing television. \"xxx xxx xxx \"Q While you were there was there an unusual incident that happened between you and your father? \"A Yes, sir. \"Q What was that? \"A When he arrived, he removed his long pants and again he was carrying a knife and he placed his knife on top of a cabinet where he used to place his clothes. \"xxx xxx xxx \"Q And then what did he do? \"A \"Pinatungan niya ako.\" \"Q What happened to the long pants you were wearing? \"A He removed it? \"Q And what happened to your pants? \"A He also removed it. \"Q What happened after that? \"A \" Pinatungan niya ako. \" \"Q What happened when he placed himself on top of you? \"A Again he made a \"kakanyog-kanyog movement again, when he was not able to insert his penis he stood up and masturbated and then I saw a white substance came out from his penis. \"xxx xxx xxx \"Q How long was he on top of you? \"A It was fact ( sic ), because it could not penetrate, because his penis was big.\" [20] Clearly, from the victim's testimony, there was no consummated rape. The accused did not succeed in inserting his penis into the vagina of his daughter. There was nothing in the victim's testimony that proved that the male penis reached the labia of the pudendum of the victim's vagina. She only said that \"his penis was touching my vagina.\" [21] There was no penetration, however slight. [22] The victim said that there was indeed no penetration because the penis of the accused was too big . The penis of the accused did not enter the labia majora of the victim but merely stroked the surface of the female organ.\n\nOther prosecution witnesses were Felix Fernandez, an uncle of Jenalyn, and Dr. Marysol C. Cerda. Felix Fernandez testified that Jenalyn revealed to him that on February 17, 1997, she was sexually abused by the accused. [23] Dr. Marysol [24] C. Cerda, who conducted a medico-legal examination on Jenalyn testified that on February 17, 1997, she was a doctor at the San Pablo City District Hospital. She examined Jenalyn at around 9:15 in the evening. The examination revealed that Jenalyn's hymen admitted one finger with ease and that it bore old healed lacerations at 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock. She identified her medico-legal report and declared that the lacerations could have been caused by penetration by the opposite sex, excessive exercises, accident, or trauma. [25]\n\nIn his defense, accused denied the accusations against him. [26] He interposed the defense of alibi . He claimed that in August 1992, he was in hiding at the house of his compadre in Gasan, Marinduque because of threats to his life for having killed two persons in San Pablo City. [27] From 1995 to August 1997, he stayed with one Alma Flores in Brgy. Cupang. [28]\n\nSonia M. Flor testified for the accused and corroborated his alibi that he was not in San Pablo City in 1992, as he was in hiding somewhere else due to the commission of two cases of homicide, [29] nor was he there in the years 1996 and 1997, since accused was not sleeping at her (Sonia's) house. [30] On cross-examination, Sonia Flor said that she could not say that Jenalyn fabricated the cases since she was not with them all the time. She confirmed, however, that whenever accused visited his children, instead of showing love to them, he mauled them and maltreated them. [31]\n\nOn August 3, 1998, the trial court rendered a decision convicting the accused of the charges, the dispositive portion of which reads:\n\"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING considerations, the accused is hereby pronounced guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of rape in the three (3) Criminal Informations cited above and for the consequences of his acts said accused ENRICO MARIANO is hereby sentenced to suffer the capital punishment of DEATH in three (3) counts and to pay the costs. Accused Enrico Mariano is ordered to pay Jenalyn F. Mariano the sum of P500,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.\n\n\"SO ORDERED.\" [32]\nHence, this automatic review. [33]\n\nThe Issue\n\nThe issue is whether the accused is guilty of consummated rape, or attempted rape on the basis of the evidence adduced.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nWe find accused Enrico Mariano y Exconde guilty of three counts of attempted rape, not consummated rape.\n\nIn his brief, accused denied that he raped his daughter Jenalyn. He claimed that the testimony of Jenalyn lacked the element of truthfulness and was not in accord with natural human experience [34] as shown by her shifting testimony as to how accused raped her, more particularly regarding the penetration of accused's penis in her vagina and the presence of the knife. [35]\n\nWe find that Jenalyn testified categorically that accused tried to insert his penis into her vagina, but did not penetrate her vagina. In the first try, the penis stroked only her singit (groin). Neither was there penile penetration of her vagina on the second and third attempts. [36] In her re-direct testimony, Jenalyn clarified that there was no penile penetration of her vagina, only \"fingering.\" We quote:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\"Q | The observation of the defense counsel is to the effect that you did not exactly remember the date when the first act of rape was committed upon you by your father, can you recall how many times you were sexually molested by your father?\n | \n\"A | Three times.\n | \n\"Q | I will read to you question and answer marked as Exhibit C question No. 5 by the police.\n | \n\"Q | - No. 5 - T - Saan at kailan nangyari ito?\n | \n | | S - Doon po sa aming dating tinitirhan sa Block 14, Lot 24, NHA, Brgy.

Campuhan, [38] we held that \"a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the mons pubis of the pudendum is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching of either labia of the pudendum by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness.\" In People v. Bation, [39] we ruled that for consummated rape to be established, \"what is essential is that there be penetration of the female organ no matter how slight.\" In People v. Oliver, [40] the Court ruled that rape is consummated \"when the penis touches the pudendum, however slightly.\" [41] Or, there is \"entrance of the male organ within the labia or pudendum of the female organ.\" [42] Very recently, in People v. Francisco, the Court ruled that \"[T]here must be sufficient and convincing proof that the penis indeed touched the labias or slid into the female organ, and not merely stroked the external surface thereof, for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape. As the labias , which are required to be `touched' by the penis, are by their natural situs beneath the mons pubis or the vaginal surface, to touch them with the penis is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface, hence, the conclusion that touching the labia majora or the labia minora of the pudendum constitutes consummated rape.\n\n\"But in the absence of any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching either labia of the pudendum by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness.\" [43]\n\nIn the testimony of Dr. Cerda, she admitted that the old healed lacerations found in Jenalyn's vagina \"could have been caused by penetration by the opposite sex, excessive exercises, accident or trauma.\" In Campuhan, we elaborated on this. We said that \"In cases of rape where there is a positive testimony and a medical certificate, both should in all respects complement each other, otherwise, to rely on the testimonial evidence alone, in utter disregard of the manifest variance in the medical certificate, would be productive of unwarranted or even mischievous results. It is necessary to carefully ascertain whether the penis of the accused in reality entered the labial threshold of the female organ to accurately conclude that rape was consummated. Failing this, the thin line that separates attempted rape from consummated rape will significantly disappear.\" [44] In Francisco, we further said that \"[T]he prosecution has the onus probandi of establishing the precise degree of culpability of the accused. It must demonstrate in sufficient detail the manner by which the crime was perpetrated. Certainly, the testimony of the victim to the effect that the accused repeatedly poked her vagina and that she felt pain as a consequence thereof, would not be enough to warrant the conclusion that a consummated rape had indeed been committed. The quantum of evidence in criminal cases requires more than that. More so in the instant case where even the medico-legal certificate failed to back up the charge of consummated rape.\" [45]\n\nConsequently, on reasonable doubt, we cannot convict the accused of consummated rape. [46] He could be guilty only of attempted rape.\n\nAs to the amount of damages, the trial court not only overlooked to impose civil indemnity which is mandatory upon a finding of the fact of attempted rape, [47] but it awarded an excessive sum of P500,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages. Prevailing jurisprudence [48] sets the amount of the civil indemnity in attempted rape at P30,000.00. Thus, the victim Jenalyn F. Mariano must be awarded civil indemnity in the sum of P30,000.00, for each count of rape in Criminal Cases Nos. 10343-SP, 10344-SP and 10345-SP.\n\nMoral damages may be awarded in recognition of the victim's injury as being inherently concomitant with and necessarily resulting from the attempted rape, especially since the victim is the offender's own innocent daughter who shall forever be haunted by a most unpleasant memory of a beastly father. [49] We award her moral damages of P25,000.00, for each count of attempted rape. [50] In addition, exemplary damages in the amount of P10,000.00, for each count of attempted rape must be awarded likewise in the hope of deterring other fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior from preying upon and sexually abusing their own young daughters.\n\nWe come to the penalty.\n\nThe penalty for attempted rape is two (2) degrees lower than the imposable penalty of death for consummated qualified rape.
