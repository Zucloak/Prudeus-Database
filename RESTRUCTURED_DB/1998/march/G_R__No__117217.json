Nos. 116450-51, March 31, 1998 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. LEONIDES RANIDO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\nVS. LEONIDES RANIDO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nREGALADO, J.:\n\nAccused-appellant\nLeonides Ranido seeks the reversal of the March 27, 1994 joint decision of the\nRegional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 24, in Criminal Cases Nos.\n93-470 and 93-2127, finding him guilty of two counts of rape. In the challenged decision, he was sentenced\nto suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count of rape, with\nthe maximum period of service of sentence not to exceed 40 years pursuant to\nArticle 70 of the Revised Penal Code, and to pay private complainant P 50,000.00\nas damages in the two cases, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of\ninsolvency. [1]\n\nThe information\nin Criminal Case No. 93-470 alleges: That on or about October 7,\n1992 at more or less 10:30 oâclock in the morning, at Barangay Mambayaan,\nBalingasag, Misamis Oriental, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this\nHonorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully,\nunlawfully and feloniously, by means of force and intimidation, abuse and\nthreats upon Marianita A. Gallogo 14 years (sic) old young woman, accused drag\n(sic) her to a room and with use of a knife, towel and cloth pinned her down and\nsucceeded in having sexual intercourse with her against her will and consent. [2]\n\nThe information\nin Criminal Case No. 93-2127 reads as follows: That on or about (the) 7th\nday of January, 1993 at more or less 5:00 oâclock in the afternoon, at Barangay\nMambayaan, Balingasag, Misamis Oriental, Philippines and within the\njurisdiction of this Honorable Court, (the above-named accused) did then and\nthere willfully, unlawfully and feloniously drag the victim to the hut, pointed\n(sic) a knife at her and have sexual intercourse with her Marianita A. Gallogo,\na woman of 14 years old (sic), against her will and consent. [3] (Words in parentheses added)\n\nUpon\narraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges and the cases were\ntried jointly. The prosecution presented\ncomplainant, Marianita A. Gallogo; her father, Renato Gallogo; [4] and the physician who conducted a\nmedical examination on complainant, Dr. Angelita A. Enopia. On the other hand, the defense presented\nappellant Leonides Ranido, and his common-law wife, Belencita Abejuela. [5]\n\nThe evidence of\nthe prosecution established that in the morning of October 7, 1992,\ncomplainant, then a 14-year old barrio lass who was working as a housekeeper\nfor one Ernesto Morit, [6] was sweeping the surroundings of\nthe house of her employer in Mambayaan, Balingasag, Misamis Oriental when\nappellant, who lived approximately 10 meters away, [7] suddenly appeared and pulled her\ntowards the house of Morit. Appellant\ngrabbed complainantâs duster from the clothesline and, once inside the house,\nhe used it to tie her hands behind her back. [8] He then led her to a bedroom\nupstairs, poked a knife at her and threatened to kill her. [9] Appellant made the victim lie on\nthe bed and pulled off her short pants and underwear. He then removed his pants and underwear, lay on top of her,\nsucked her breasts and forced his penis into her vagina. [10]\n\nThere were no\nother persons in the house at that time and complainant was terrified and\nunable to resist appellant. After\nsatisfying his lust, appellant untied complainantâs hands and left her in the\nroom. [11]\n\nSeveral days\nlater, complainant and her brother were tending cows behind their familyâs hut\nwhen appellant approached and warned her that if she should tell her father\nabout what occurred on October 7, 1992, he would kill them both. [12]\n\nIt was revealed\nduring the testimony of complainant in court that on four other occasions\nsubsequent to said occurrence, and likewise in the house of Morit, appellant\nforced himself upon complainant and sexually abused her. [13] In each instance, complainant and\nappellant were alone in the house [14] and appellant no longer bound her\nhands. Neither was it necessary for him\nto threaten her with a knife as her fear and the intimidation to which she was\nsubjected were sufficient to restrain her from offering resistance against\nappellant.\n\nIn the afternoon\nof January 7, 1993, complainant went to a nearby river to wash clothes. On her way home at around 5:00 P.M., she was\nwalking by the hut of appellant when he unexpectedly pulled her inside and took\nher into a room. There, he raised her\nduster and pulled down her underwear, after which he removed his own pants and\nunderwear, lay on top of her, and once again defiled her. [15] Appellant threatened to kill her if\nshe resisted him [16] and, as in the previous instances,\nthe victim yielded to his lechery because of fear.\n\nAt this\njuncture, Abejuela, appellantâs common-law wife of 26 years, [17] arrived and caught him in the act\nof violating complainant. Abejuela\nbecame hysterical and charged at complainant, pulled her hair, and would have\nstruck her with a bottle had appellant not parried the same. Complainant took the opportunity to free\nherself from appellant and flee from the hut. She proceeded to her neighborâs house and did not go home that night\nbecause she was afraid that her father would beat her. [18]\n\nRenato Gallogo,\nthe father of complainant, testified that he was at home at around 6:00 oâclock\nthat same evening when Abejuela, who was with a companion, arrived and told him\nthat his daughter and appellant were having sexual intercourse. Gallogo retorted that Abejuela should\nclarify her statement, otherwise, he would hack her. Abejuela hurriedly left and Gallogo went to look for his\ndaughter. It was only the following\nmorning that he was able to find her at the house of his niece, half a\nkilometer away from his house. [19]\n\nWhen Gallogo\nquestioned complainant about the report of Abejuela, she admitted that it was\ntrue and that it was not the first time that she was raped by appellant. Gallogoâs initial impulse was to take his\ndaughter to a physician for medical examination. [20] However, he first brought her to\nthe barangay station commander where they reported the incidents and\ncomplainant executed an affidavit. [21] They then proceeded to the Medicare\nclinic in Balingasag where complainant was examined by its resident physician,\nDr. Angelita A. Enopia.\n\nThe medical\ncertificate issued by said physician indicated the following findings: -No\nfresh vaginal lacerations noted -Multiple\nold laceration(s) of the hymen -Vaginal\norifice admitted two fingers easily -With fresh scanty bloody\ndischarges [22]\n\nThe physician testified that although no spermatozoa was detected,\ncomplainant was menstruating at the time of the examination and the flow\nthereof could have washed away whatever spermatozoa may have been discharged\ninto her vagina. [23]\n\nAppellant denied\nthe charges. He contended that he and\ncomplainant were neighbors and that she would frequently ask him for vegetables\n(â malunggay â) and money. Complainant would often tease him and would sometimes show him her leg\nand run away, but he was never tempted by these flirtations because he was\nalready in his fifties and no longer capable of sexual intercourse, although he\noccasionally made love to his common-law wife. [24] Besides, appellant claimed that he\nwas always tired. [25]\n\nHe further\nasserted that on October 7, 1992, the date when the first incident of rape\nallegedly took place in the house of Morit, he was at home when complainant\narrived and asked him for vegetables. She\nsupposedly left as soon as he gave her vegetables and even returned the\nfollowing day to ask for money. [26]\n\nWith respect to\nthe incident of January 7, 1993, appellant said that he was in a hut in the\nbanana plantation of one Raul Cagatawan, about 300 meters away from the house\nof complainant, since he was the overseer of the property and the trees\nthereon. He, however, vehemently denied\nthat he raped complainant there, and insisted that she came to him to ask for money\nand to consult him about her problems with her boyfriend who had allegedly\nvictimized her. He averred that he was\nmerely talking to complainant and giving her friendly advice when Abejuela\narrived and went on a jealous rampage. [27] Appellant concluded that Abejuela\ngot jealous and had a fit because he and complainant were seated together and\ncomplainant was holding his hand. [28]\n\nAbejuela\ncorroborated the testimony of appellant and maintained that on January 7, 1993,\nshe went to the plantation to bring supper to appellant when she found him\ntalking to complainant in the hut therein. She said that although the two were only chatting, she became extremely\njealous and scolded complainant who immediately left the place. She then confronted and quarreled with\nappellant because she resented his conversing with complainant who was reputed\nto have several boyfriends. [29] From there, she proceeded to the\nhouse of complainant and told her father, Renato Gallogo, to watch her. [30]\n\nIt is indubitable that appellant was with complainant on October 7, 1992 and\nJanuary 7, 1993, the dates when the subject acts of rape allegedly took\nplace. Appellant did not disclaim that\nhe was with complainant on several other dates on which, so the prosecution\nclaims, he likewise raped her. He\nnonetheless forcefully denied that he raped complainant or made sexual advances\nat her.\n\nThe trial court\nconvicted appellant of two counts of rape committed on October 7, 1992 and\nJanuary 7, 1993, hence this appeal where he raises a lone assignment of error\nthat the trial court erred in convicting him of the offenses charged. Appellant, in his brief, contends that the\ninconsistencies in his defense and the weakness thereof do not warrant his\nconviction as the evidence of the prosecution is unconvincing and fails to\nprove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe Court, after\nexhaustive review and objective analysis of the records of this case, is in\nagreement with the findings of the lower court and consequently affirms the\nconviction of appellant.\n\nWhen Abejuela\ninformed Gallogo on January 7, 1993 that appellant was having sexual\nintercourse with his daughter, Abejuela was purportedly with a companion [31] but the prosecution did not present\nthat alleged companion as a witness during the trial. Appellant maintains that such failure to present the witness\nbelies the allegation that Abejuela actually informed Gallogo of the rape\nincident. This contention has to be\nrejected.\n\nThe testimony of\nthe companion of Abejuela was dispensable and the absence thereof does not\nweaken the stand of the prosecution. The crime of rape is essentially one committed in secrecy, hence it is\nusually only the victim who can testify with regard to the fact of forced\ncoitus. [32] As a result, conviction may be\nbased solely on the plausible testimony of the private complainant.\n\nIn the case at\nbar, the conviction of appellant was premised on the testimonies of\ncomplainant, her father, and the physician who conducted a medical examination\non her, as well as a medical certificate and other evidence presented by the\nprosecution which the trial court found sufficient. The judgment of conviction cannot, therefore, be regarded as\nunfounded or baseless.\n\nFurthermore,\nappellant was positively identified by complainant, and his alibi that he could\nnot have raped her in the house of Morit on October 7, 1992 since he was at\nhome at the time is bereft of merit because it is uncontroverted that he lived\nonly 10 meters away from the house of Morit. [33] Evidently, it was not\nphysically impossible for him to have\ncommitted the crime as charged. His\nalibi is self-serving and his bare denial is a negative declaration which\ndeserves no consideration and cannot prevail over the affirmative testimony of\ncomplainant which was corroborated by further evidence. [34]\n\nAppellant\nmoreover asserts that the reaction of complainantâs father, upon learning that\nshe had been raped, was unnatural. As\nearlier recounted, Renato Gallogoâs impulse, upon confronting complainant and\nconfirming the report that appellant had assaulted her, was to take her to a\nphysician for medical examination. Appellant argues in his brief that such response was extraordinary and\nabnormal because if appellant had really raped complainant, Gallogo should have\nimmediately confronted him as human nature dictates. He allegedly should have taken revenge for his daughterâs honor\nand taken the law into his own hands, instead of merely having her subjected to\nmedical examination.\n\nIt has been\nrepeatedly ruled by the Court that the workings of a human mind are\nunpredictable; people react differently under emotional stress and there is no\nstandard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident. [35] Accordingly, while Gallogoâs\ninitial response to the news of the rape may be atypical, it cannot be deemed\nso unsual as to undermine the cause of the prosecution. Gallogo was a poor farmer of low educational\nattainment but, to his credit, this by itself did not make him incapable of\nbehaving rationally and with composure, as shown by his comportment when he\nspontaneously brought his daughter to the authorities for legal and medical\nexamination.\n\nRape is\ncommitted by having carnal knowledge of a woman by inter alia , using\nforce or intimidation. It is not\nnecessary that the force or intimidation employed be so great or of such\ncharacter as could not be resisted because all that is required is that it be\nsufficient to consummate the purpose which the accused had in mind. [36] The ambient circumstances must,\ntherefore, be viewed from the victimâs perception and judgment at the time of\nthe rape.\n\nAlthough\ncomplainant was 15 years old at the time of the trial, the court below found\nthat she only had the mental capacity of a fifth grade student and did not\npossess the necessary discernment when appellant had carnal knowledge of her. [37] Appellant evidently, took advantage\nof her mental weakness and vulnerability. More detestably, he bound her hands and intimidated her with a knife\nwhen he raped her on October 7, 1992. He also threatened to kill her and her father if she reported the\nincident. Complainant was hopelessly daunted\neach time she was assaulted. The force and intimidation employed by appellant\nwere sufficient to terrorize her and reduce her to a defenseless sex object.\n\nComplainant was\na wisp of a girl when the acts of rape took place. It is instinctive for a young, unmarried woman like her to\nprotect her honor and it is thus difficult to believe that she would fabricate\na tale of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts, reveal her\nshame to the small town where she grew up, and permit herself to be the subject\nof a public trial if she had not really been ravished. [38] Besides, the records are devoid of\nany improper motive which would have moved complainant to charge appellant with\nrape. Therefore, the logical conclusion\nis that no such unseemly motive exists and her testimony is worthy of credit. [39]\n\nWe hold that\nappellantâs guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt. While it is clear to the Court that there\nwere six acts of rape committed, as indicated by the testimony of complainant,\nthe two indictments filed in the lower court charged appellant with only two\nacts of rape committed on October 7, 1992 and January 7, 1993. Accordingly, consistent with the\nconstitutional right of an accused to be informed of the accusation against\nhim, [40] appellant cannot be held liable for\nmore than what he was charged with. There can only be a conviction for two counts of rape because each of\nthe two informations charges only one offense of rape, even if the evidence\nshows that six separate acts of forcible sexual intercourse took place. [41]\n\nAt this\njuncture, we note that when these offenses were committed the governing law was\nArticle 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4111, under\nwhich the use of a deadly weapon in committing the offense of rape was, as it\nstill is, punished by reclusion perpetua to death. [42] No aggravating circumstance having\nbeen alleged or proved in these cases, the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each conviction was correctly imposed by the court a quo . [43] Finally, the indemnity to be paid\nby appellant to private complainant should be modified to P 50,000.00 [44] for each count of rape, or a total\nof P 100,000.00. Complainant\nshould be indemnified for each felony of rape as these serious offenses were\ncommitted on two separate occasions several months apart.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appealed judgment of the\nRegional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 24, in Criminal Cases Nos. 93-470\nand 93-2127 is hereby AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that appellant is ordered\nto indemnify the offended party, Marianita A. Gallogo, in the total amount of\nOne Hundred Thousand Pesos ( P 100,000.00) as damages. Costs against accused-appellant Leonides\nRanido in all instances.\n\nSO ORDERED.
