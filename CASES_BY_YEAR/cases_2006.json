JUDGE EMILIO L. LEACHON, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH CCXXIV, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPUNO, J.:\n\nOn February 15, 1996, fifteen (15) complainants [1] filed with the Office of the Court Administrator an administrative case against respondent JUDGE EMILIO L. LEACHON, JR., Presiding Judge, Branch CCXXIV, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, charging him with manifest partiality, knowingly rendering an unjust and oppressive order, and misconduct in connection with an injunction case (Civil Case No. Q-95-25779) pending before his sala.\n\nThe records show that on December 1, 1995, complainants filed with the RTC of Quezon City a complaint for injunction, [2] with prayer for a temporary restraining order, to enjoin defendants therein, Claudine Borlongan, et al., from summarily demolishing complainants' houses. Their complaint was raffled to the sala of respondent judge.\n\nDefendants filed their Opposition [3] to the issuance of a temporary restraining order, with motion to dismiss. Hearing on the issuance of the preliminary injunction was held on December 5, 1995. Three (3) days later or on December 8, 1995, respondent judge issued an Order [4] denying the preliminary injunction and dismissing the complaint. He further ordered the demolition of complainants' houses but in deference to the Christmas season, he deferred its execution until January 1, 1996.\n\nOn December 12, 1995, complainants filed their Notice of Appeal. On December 13, 1995, the Court of Appeals gave due course to their appeal and directed the trial court to transmit the records of the case for review.\n\nOn December 27, 1995, at about 7:00 p.m., the trial court's sheriff served on complainants' counsel a copy of defendant Borlongan's motion [5] for execution pending appeal which was set for hearing on December 29, 1995, at 8:30 a.m. The motion did not comply with the three-day notice rule.\n\nOn December 28, 1995, complainants filed their Opposition to the Motion for Execution. They contended that respondent judge had lost jurisdiction over the case with the perfection of their appeal with the Court of Appeals. When complainants' counsel presented the Opposition to respondent judge's personnel, he was informed that respondent judge had already prepared an Order granting defendant's motion for execution pending appeal.\n\nNonetheless, on December 29, 1995, the date set for hearing of defendants' motion, complainants' counsel appeared in court. He was informed that respondent judge would not be arriving for the latter had already issued an Order [6] of even date granting defendant's motion. Complainants' counsel was furnished the Order upon his demand.\n\nComplainants then questioned respondent judge's December 29, 1995 Order by certiorari to the Court of Appeals. On January 2, 1996, the Court of Appeals issued a TRO enjoining the implementation of said Order.\n\nOn January 24, 1996, a writ of execution [7] was issued by respondent judge's officer-in-charge Rowena Camacho and was implemented on the same day without notice to complainants or their counsel.\n\nOn February 15, 1996, the Court of Appeals issued a Decision [8] finding that respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing his December 29, 1995 Order and permanently enjoined defendants and respondent judge from implementing said Order.\n\nOn even date, complainants filed this administrative case against respondent judge for manifest partiality, knowingly rendering an unjust and oppressive order, and misconduct. Complainants also charged that respondent judge entertained litigants inside his office under suspicious circumstances. On March 7, 1996, the Office of the Court Administrator referred the case to this Court for appropriate action.\n\nIn compliance with the directive of this Court to answer the charges against him, respondent judge filed his Comment. [9] To justify his dismissal of the complaint for injunction, respondent judge cites two (2) previous cases involving the same lot which were decided with finality against herein complainants. He asserts thus:\n\"In the course of the hearing, it surfaced and appeared from the pleadings and oral arguments of the parties that before the instant case was filed, two previous cases were filed by same herein plaintiffs against the Gaffud Family, former owner of the subject property, which touched and dealt on the right of the herein plaintiffs to stay on the subject property.\n\n\"The first case was filed by the herein plaintiffs against the owners of the property docketed as Civil Case No. Q-89-1896, RTC, Branch 95, Quezon City, for the extension of lease and injunction, with prayer for (the) issuance of writ of preliminary injunction and damages where a Decision was rendered by Hon. Presiding Judge Aloysious Alday on December 11, 1990, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\n\n'Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered: (a) extending for a period of eight months from finality of this Decision each of the respective leases of plaintiffs Priscilla Asis, Napoleon Dulay, Sr., Victor Puddao, Teody Venzon, and Claudio Villapa, Sr., over the subject premises; (b) denying and dismissing for lack of merit the rest of plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and prayers, as well as private defendants' counterclaim and prayers herein; (c) making permanent (the) writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued insofar as it concerns plaintiffs Priscilla Asis, Napoleon Dulay, Sr., Victor Puddao, Teody Venzon and Claudio Villapa, Sr., and lifting said writ insofar as it concerns the rest of the plaintiffs herein; and ordering private defendants to pay the cost of (the) suit.'\n\n\"Th(is) Decision x x x was appealed by the herein plaintiffs to the Court of Appeals which dismissed the appeal x x x and also denied the Motion for Reconsideration x x x. On Petition for Review to the Supreme Court x x x, the Supreme Court affirmed the Decision of the Court of Appeals and the RTC Decision x x x in G.R. No. 120351.\n\n\"It would appear therefore that only five (5) of the herein plaintiffs were granted extension of lease for eight months and the rest of 14 plaintiffs herein were declared by the Court to have no Contracts of Lease with the owners of the subject property, the Gaffud Family, and the Writ of Injunction denied and the Amended Complaint dismissed as against them in favor of the defendant owners of the subject property. The eight months extension granted the five (5) of the herein plaintiffs have long expired and they have not entered into new lease contracts with the subject owners to this date, neither have they paid rentals for their stay on the subject premises to stave off eviction.\n\n\"In sum, all the herein 19 plaintiffs have not been paying rentals on the subject property which were admitted in open Court by herein plaintiffs thru their counsel, Atty. Antonio Inton, and being deforciant tenants, they are subject to eviction and their houses also demolished, pursuant to the Order of the defendant Quezon City government officials for violation of the National Building Code.\n\n\"The second case filed by the herein plaintiffs against the former owners of the subject property was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-91-9681, Regional Trial Court, Branch 82, presided x x x by Honorable Salvador E. Ceguera. The second case which was for injunction to enjoin or restrain the intended demolition of the subject structures was likewise dismissed for violation of the Supreme Court Circular against forum shopping, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\n\n'In view of the foregoing, the plaintiffs are now applying before this Court for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction or Restraining Order.\n\n'In view of the aforesaid case, plaintiffs applied for a writ of preliminary injunction against the said threats of demolition made by the private respondents. Now the plaintiffs are again praying for another writ of preliminary injunction also against the threats of demolition made by the private defendants on plaintiffs' dwellings x x x. The Honorable Aloysius C. Alday already made a ruling on the prayer for relief before this Court. They are clearly forum shopping, in search of a Court which will be favorably disposed to granting the relief they seek. This cannot be countenanced x x x.\n\n\"The third case filed by herein plaintiffs is the instant case which could be dismissed also outright for being violative of the Supreme Court Circular against Forum-Shopping and also because the cause of action herein has been barred by prior judgment.\" [10] Respondent judge further explained that although complainants had already perfected their appeal, he issued the questioned Order granting execution pending appeal, pursuant to Section 4, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, he did not require the defendants in said case to post a bond since complainants' interests were sufficiently safeguarded for the latter could always go after the properties subject of the litigation should they win in their appeal before the Court of Appeals.\n\nRespondent judge also clarified that when he received the January 2, 1996 Order of the Court of Appeals temporarily restraining him from executing his questioned Order, he did not allow the defendants in the injunction case to proceed with the scheduled demolition of complainants' houses on that day.\n\nOn January 23, 1996, defendant Borlongan filed a motion to proceed with the eviction. Complainants opposed and hearing thereon was set on January 24, 1996, as requested by complainants. However, complainants and their counsel failed to appear at the hearing of the motion. Thus, respondent judge issued an Order granting the motion for execution pending appeal since the 20-day period for the validity of the TRO already expired. On January 29, 1996, the demolition and eviction were completed and the subject property was turned over to defendant Borlongan.\n\nAs to the charge that he entertains litigants in his chambers under suspicious circumstances, respondent judge explained that the same has no basis for his office and that of his eleven (11) staff consists merely of a small room with an area of only about three by four meters. Given this cramped space, it is inconceivable how he could entertain said litigants \"under suspicious circumstances\" within the presence and hearing distance of his entire personnel.\n\nOur evaluation of this case reveals that although the Court of Appeals found that respondent judge abused his discretion in issuing the questioned order, it was not satisfactorily shown that he acted in bad faith, with malice or in wilful disregard of a litigant's right. As a matter of public policy, not every error or mistake of a judge in the performance of his official duties make him liable therefor. In the absence of fraud, dishonesty or corruption, the acts of a judge in his official capacity does not always amount to misconduct although such acts may be erroneous. A judge may not be disciplined for error of judgment unless there is proof that the error was made with a conscious and deliberate intent to do an injustice. Nevertheless, this is not to say that a judge need not observe due care in the performance of his functions.\n\nIn the case at bar, respondent judge, in ordering the dismissal of the complaint, relied on the final rulings of this Court and the Regional Trial Court in two (2) previous cases which essentially involved the same parties and dealt with the same subject matter. Believing in good faith that the third case filed before his sala is a mere reiteration of the same issues earlier laid to rest and resolved with finality by other courts, respondent judge ordered the dismissal of the complaint. Nevertheless, although his order granting the motion to dismiss was timely appealed by complainants to the Court of Appeals, respondent judge proceeded to issue an Order directing the execution of his appealed order, which eventually resulted in the demolition of complainants' houses. On top of this, respondent judge did not require a bond to support defendant's application for a writ of execution. Under the circumstances, respondent judge had lost jurisdiction to entertain the motion for execution after the perfection of the appeal and after the lower court had been ordered to transmit the records of the case to the appellate court for review. Needless to state, his precipitate action on the motion for execution resulted in legal complications and hardship on the part of complainants which merits the imposition of an administrative sanction.\n\nAs to the charge against respondent judge that he entertains litigants in his office under suspicious circumstances, the same is dismissed for lack of basis and merit.\n\nIN VIEW WHEREOF, respondent JUDGE EMILIO L. LEACHON, JR. is reprimanded for continuing to act in Civil Case No. Q-95-25779 when he had lost jurisdiction over the case.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nRegalado, (Chairman), Romero, and Torres, Jr., JJ., concur.\nMendoza, J., no part because of close association with respondent.\n\n[1] Namely: Ernesto Riego, Claudio Villapa, Sr.,Teodoro Aba, Priscilla Asis, Tomasa Cipriano, Teody Venzon, Gaudencio Juan, Rafael Paclabare, Victor Puddao, Felicisimo Reyes, Ernesto Lopez, Leonides Rabasol, Pablito Semano, Remedios Dulay and Nenita Demetria.\n\n[2] Rollo, pp. 53-63.\n\n[3] Id., pp. 78-81.\n\n[4] Id., pp. 11-14.\n\n[5] Rollo, pp. 15-16.\n\n[6] Id., pp. 17-18.\n\n[7] Rollo, pp. 19-20.\n\n[8] Penned by Associate Justice Salome A.

Abdullah issued an Order which granted respondent union's petition for certification election among the rank-and-file employees of the Capitol Medical Center.[2] Respondent CMC appealed the Order to the Office of the Secretary by questioning the legal status of respondent union's affiliation with the Alliance of Filipino Workers (AFW). To correct any supposed infirmity in its legal status, respondent union registered itself independently and withdrew the petition which had earlier been granted. Thereafter, it filed another petition for certification election.On May 29, 1992, Med-Arbiter Manases T . Cruz issued an order granting the petition for certification election.[3] Respondent CMC again appealed to the Office of the Secretary which affirmed[4] the Order of the Med-Arbiter granting the certification election.On December 9, 1992, elections were finally held with respondent union garnering 204 votes, 168 in favor of no union and 8 spoiled ballots out of a total of 380 votes cast. Thereafter, on January 4, 1993, Med-Arbiter Cruz issued an Order certifying respondent union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of the rank and file employees at CMC.[5]Unsatisfied with the outcome of the elections, respondent CMC again appealed to the Office of the Secretary of Labor which appeal was denied on February 26, 1993.[6] A subsequent motion for reconsideration filed by respondent CMC was likewise denied on March 23, 1993.[7]Respondent CMC's basic contention was the supposed pendency of its petition for cancellation of respondent union's certificate of registration in Case No. NCR-OD-M- 92211-028. In the said case , Med-Arbiter Paterno Adap issued an Order dated February 4, 1993 which declared respondent union's certificate of registration as null and void.[8] However, this order was reversed on appeal by the Officer-in-Charge of the Bureau of Labor Relations in her Order issued on April 13, 1993. The said Order dismissed the motion for cancellation of the certificate of registration of respondent union and declared that it was not only a bona fide affiliate or local of a federation (AFW), but a duly registered union as well. Subsequently, this case reached this Court in Capitol Medical Center, Inc. v. Hon. Perlita Velasco, G. R. No. 110718, where we issued a Resolution dated December 13 , 1993, dismissing the petition of CMC for failure to sufficiently show that public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion.[9] The motion for reconsideration filed by CMC was likewise denied in our Resolution dated February 2, 1994.[10] Thereafter , on March 23, 1994, we issued an entry of judgment certifying that the Resolution dated December 13, 1993 has become final and executory.[11]Respondent union, after being declared as the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of respondent CMC by Med-Arbiter Cruz, presented economic proposals for the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). However , respondent CMC contended that CBA negotiations should be suspended in view of the Order issued on February 4, 1993 by Med-Arbiter Adap declaring the registration of respondent union as null and void. In spite of the refusal of respondent CMC, respondent union still persisted in its demand for CBA negotiations, claiming that it has already been declared as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of the hospital.Due to respondent CMC's refusal to bargain collectively, respondent union filed a notice of strike on March 1, 1993. After complying with the other legal requirements, respondent union staged a strike on April 15, 1993. On April 16, 1993, the Secretary of Labor assumed jurisdiction over the case and issued an order certifying the same to the National Labor Relations Commission for compulsory arbitration where the said case is still pending.[12]It is at this juncture that petitioner union, on March 24, 1994, filed a petition for certification election among the regular rank-and-file employees of the Capitol Medical Center Inc. It alleged in its petition that: 1) three hundred thirty one (331) out of the four hundred (400) total rank-and-file employees of respondent CMC signed a petition to conduct a certification election; and 2) that the said employees are withdrawing their authorization for the said union to represent them as they have joined and formed the union Capitol Medical Center Alliance of Concerned Employees (CMC-ACE). They also alleged that a certification election can now be conducted as more that 12 months have lapsed since the last certification election was held. Moreover, no certification election was conducted during the twelve (12) months prior to the petition, and no collective bargaining agreement has as yet been concluded between respondent union and respondent CMC despite the lapse of twelve months from the time the said union was voted as the collective bargaining representative.On April 12, 1994, respondent union opposed the petition and moved for its dismissal . It contended that it is the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of the Hospital, which was confirmed by the Secretary of Labor and Employment and by this Court. It also alleged that it was not remiss in asserting its right as the certified bargaining agent for it continuously demanded the negotiation of a CBA with the hospital despite the latter's avoidance to bargain collectively. Respondent union was even constrained to strike on April 15, 1993, where the Secretary of Labor intervened and certified the dispute for compulsory arbitration. Furthermore, it alleged that majority of the signatories who supported the petition were managerial and confidential employees and not members of the rank-and-file, and that there was no valid disaffiliation of its members, contrary to petitioner's allegations.Petitioner, in its rejoinder, claimed that there is no legal impediment to the conduct of a certification election as more than twelve ( 12 ) months had lapsed since respondent union was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent and no CBA was as yet concluded. It also claimed that the other issues raised could only be resolved by conducting another certification election.In its surrejoinder, respondent union alleged that the petition to conduct a certification election was improper, immoral and in manifest disregard of the decisions rendered by the Secretary of Labor and by this Court. It claimed that CMC employed \"legal obstructionism's\" in order to let twelve months pass without a CBA having been concluded between them so as to pave the way for the entry of petitioner union.On May 12, 1994, Med-Arbiter Brigida Fadrigon, issued an Order granting the petition for certification election among the rank and file employees.[13] It ruled that the issue was the majority status of respondent union. Since no certification election was held within one year from the date of issuance of a final certification election result and there was no bargaining deadlock between respondent union and the employees that had been submitted to conciliation or had become the subject of a valid notice of strike or lock out, there is no bar to the holding of a certification election.[14]Respondent union appealed from the said Order, alleging that the Med-Arbiter erred in granting the petition for certification election and in holding that this case falls under Section 3, Rule V, Book V of the Rules Implementing the Labor Code.[15] It also prayed that the said provision must not be applied strictly in view of the facts in this case.Petitioner union did not file any opposition to the appeal.On November 18, 1994, public respondent rendered a Resolution granting the appeal.[16] He ratiocinated that while the petition was indeed filed after the lapse of one year form the time of declaration of a final certification result, and that no bargaining deadlock had been submitted for conciliation or arbitration, respondent union was not remiss on its right to enter into a CBA for it was the CMC which refused to bargain collectively.[17]CMC and petitioner union separately filed motions for reconsideration of the said Order.CMC contended that in certification election proceedings, the employer cannot be ordered to bargain collectively with a union since the only issue involved is the determination of the bargaining agent of the employees.Petitioner union claimed that to completely disregard the will of the 331 rank-and-file employees for a certification election would result in the denial of their substantial rights and interests. Moreover, it contended that public respondent's \"indictment\" that petitioner \"capitalize (sic) on the ensuing delay which was caused by the Hospital, . x x x\" was unsupported by the facts and the records.On January 11, 1995, public respondent issued a Resolution which denied the two motions for reconsideration, hence this petition.[18]The pivotal issue in this case is whether or not public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition for certification election, and in directing the hospital to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the said respondent union.Petitioner alleges that public respondent Undersecretary Laguesma denied it due process when it ruled against the holding of a certification election. It further claims that the denial of due process can be gleaned from the manner by which the assailed resolution was written, i. e., instead of the correct name of the mother federation UNIFIED, it was referred to as UNITED; and that the respondent union's name CMCEA-AFW was referred to as CMCEA-AFLO. Petitioner maintains that such errors indicate that the assailed resolution was prepared with \"indecent haste.\"We do not subscribe to petitioner's contention.The errors pointed to by petitioner can be classified as mere typographical errors which cannot materially alter the substance and merit of the assailed resolution.Petitioner cannot merely anchor its position on the aforementioned erroneous' names just to attain a reversal of the questioned resolution . As correctly observed by the Solicitor General, petitioner is merely \"nit-picking , vainly trying to make a monumental issue out of a negligible error of the public respondent.\"[19]Petitioner also assails public respondents' findings that the former \"capitalize ( sic ) on the ensuing delay which was caused by the hospital and which resulted in the non-conclusion of a CBA within the certification year.\"[20] It further argues that the denial of its motion for a fair hearing was a clear case of a denial of its right to due process.Such contention of petitioner deserves scant consideration.A perusal of the record shows that petitioner failed to file its opposition to oppose the grounds for respondent union's appeal.It was given an opportunity to be heard but lost it when it refused to file an appellee's memorandum.Petitioner insists that the circumstances prescribed in Section 3, Rule V, Book V of the Rules Implementing the Labor Code where a certification election should be conducted, viz: (1) that one year had lapsed since the issuance of a final certification result; and (2) that there is no bargaining deadlock to which the incumbent or certified bargaining agent is a party has been submitted to conciliation or arbitration, or had become the subject of a valid notice of strike or lockout, are present in this case. It further claims that since there is no evidence on record that there exists a CBA deadlock, the law allowing the conduct of a certification election after twelve months must be given effect in the interest of the right of the workers to freely choose their sole and exclusive bargaining agent.While it is true that, in the case at bench, one year had lapsed since the time of declaration of a final certification result, and that there is no collective bargaining deadlock, public respondent did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it ruled in respondent union's favor since the delay in the forging of the CBA could not be attributed to the fault of the latter.A scrutiny of the records will further reveal that after respondent union was certified as the bargaining agent of CMC, it invited the employer hospital to the bargaining table by submitting its economic proposal for a CBA. However, CMC refused to negotiate with respondent union and instead challenged the latter's legal personality through a petition for cancellation of the certificate of registration which eventually reached this Court. The decision affirming the legal status of respondent union should have left CMC with no other recourse but to bargain collectively, but still it did not. Respondent union was left with no other recourse but to file a notice of strike against CMC for unfair labor practice with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board. This eventually led to a strike on April 15 , 1993.Petitioner union on the other hand, after this Court issued an entry of judgment on March 23, 1994, filed the subject petition for certification election on March 24, 1994, claiming that twelve months had lapsed since the last certification election.Was there a bargaining deadlock between CMC and respondent union, before the filing of petitioner of a petition for certification election, which had been submitted to conciliation or had become the subject of a valid notice of strike or lockout?In the case of Divine Word University of Tacloban v. Secretary of Labor and Employment,[21] we had the occasion to define what a deadlock is, viz:\"A 'deadlock' is xxx the counteraction of things producing entire stoppage; xxx There is a deadlock when there is a complete blocking or stoppage resulting from the action of equal and opposed forces xxx. The word is synonymous with the word impasse, which xxx 'presupposes reasonable effort at good faith bargaining which, despite noble intentions, does not conclude in agreement between the parties. ' \"Although there is no \"deadlock\" in its strict sense as there is no \"counteraction\" of forces present in this case nor \"reasonable effort at good faith bargaining, \"such can be attributed to CMC's fault as the bargaining proposals of respondent union were never answered by CMC. In fact, what happened in this case is worse than a bargaining deadlock for CMC employed all legal means to block the certification of respondent union as the bargaining agent of the rank-and-file; and use it as its leverage for its failure to bargain with respondent union. Thus, we can only conclude that CMC was unwilling to negotiate and reach an agreement with respondent union. CMC has not at any instance shown willingness to discuss the economic proposals given by respondent union.[22]As correctly ratiocinated by public respondent, to wit:\"For herein petitioner to capitalize on the ensuing delay which was caused by the hospital and which resulted in the non-conclusion of a CBA within the certification year, would be to negate and render a mockery of the proceedings undertaken before this Department and to put an unjustified premium on the failure of the respondent hospital to perform its duty to bargain collectively as mandated in Article 252 of the Labor Code, as amended, which states.\"\"Article 252. Meaning of duty to bargain collectively - the duty to bargain collectively means the performance of a mutual obligation to meet and convene promptly and expeditiously in good faith for the purpose of negotiating an agreement with respect to wages, hours of work and all other terms and conditions of employment including proposals for adjusting any grievance or questions arising under such agreement and executing a contract incorporating such agreements if requested by either party but such duty does not compel any party to agree to a proposal or to make any concession.\"The duly certified bargaining agent, CMCEA - AFW, should not be made to further bear the brunt flowing from the respondent hospital's reluctance and thinly disguised refusal to bargain.\"[23]If the law proscribes the conduct of a certification election when there is a bargaining deadlock submitted to conciliation or arbitration, with more reason should it not be conducted if, despite attempts to bring an employer to the negotiation table by the certified bargaining agent, there was \"no reasonable effort in good faith\" on the employer to bargain collectively.In the case of Kaisahan ng Manggagawang Pilipino vs. Trajano, 201 SCRA 453 (1991), penned by Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa, the factual milieu of which is similar to this case, this Court allowed the holding of a certification election and ruled that the one year period known as the \"certification year\" has long since expired. We also ruled, that: \"xxx prior to the filing of the petition for election in this case, there was no such 'bargaining deadlock xx (which) had been submitted to conciliation or arbitration or had become the subject of a valid notice of strike or lockout.' To be sure, there are in the record assertions by NAFLU that its attempts to bring VIRON to the negotiation table had been unsuccessful because of the latter's recalcitrance, and unfulfilled promises to bargain collectively; but there is no proof that it had taken any action to legally coerce VIRON to comply with its statutory duty to bargain collectively. It could have charged VIRON with unfair labor practice; but it did not. It could have gone on a legitimate strike in protest against VIRON's refusal to bargain collectively and compel it to do so; but it did not. There are assertions by NAFLU, too, that its attempts to bargain collectively had been delayed by continuing challenges to the resolution pronouncing it the sole bargaining representative in VIRON; but there is no adequate substantiation thereof , or of how it did in fact prevent initiation of the bargaining process between it and VIRON.\"[24]Although the statements pertinent to this case are merely obiter, still the fact remains that in the Kaisahan case, NAFLU was counselled by this Court on the steps that it should have undertaken to protect its interest, but which it failed to do so.This is what is strikingly different between the Kaisahan case and the case at bench for in the latter case, there was proof that the certified bargaining agent, respondent union, had taken an action to legally coerce the employer to comply with its statutory duty to bargain collectively, i. e., charging the employer with unfair labor practice and conducting a strike in protest against the employer's refusal to bargain.[25] It is only just and equitable that the circumstances in this case should be considered as similar in nature to a \"bargaining deadlock\" when no certification election could be held. This is also to make sure that no floodgates will be opened for the circumvention of the law by unscrupulous employers to prevent any certified bargaining agent from negotiating a CBA. Thus, Section 3, Rule V, Book V of the Implement Rules should be interpreted liberally so as to include a circumstance, e. g. where a CBA could not be concluded due to the failure of one party to willingly perform its duty to bargain collectively.The order for the hospital to bargain is based on its failure to bargain collectively with respondent union.WHEREFORE, the Resolution dated November 18, 1994 of public respondent Laguesma is AFFIRMED and the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED.SO ORDERED.Padilla, Bellosillo, Vitug, and Kapunan, JJ., concur.[1] NCR-00-M-9403-052.[2] Rollo, pp. 145-153.[3] Rollo, pp. 154-158.[4] Rollo, pp. 164-169.[5] Rollo, pp. 172-173.[6] Rollo, pp. 174-176.[7] Rollo, pp. 177-178.[8] Rollo, pp. 199-203.[9] Rollo, p. 281.[10] Rollo, p. 282.[11] Rollo, p. 283.[12] Rollo, pp. 209-210.[13] Rollo, pp. 26-31.[14] Ibid.[15] Rollo, pp. 71-77.[16] Rollo, pp. 33-41.[17] Ibid.[18] Rollo, pp. 43-44.[19] Rollo, p. 351.[20] Rollo, p. 14.[21] 213 SCRA 759 (1992).[22] cf.

The decision affirming the legal status of respondent union should have left CMC with no other recourse but to bargain collectively, but still it did not. Respondent union was left with no other recourse but to file a notice of strike against CMC for unfair labor practice with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board. This eventually led to a strike on April 15 , 1993.\n\nPetitioner union on the other hand, after this Court issued an entry of judgment on March 23, 1994, filed the subject petition for certification election on March 24, 1994, claiming that twelve months had lapsed since the last certification election.\n\nWas there a bargaining deadlock between CMC and respondent union, before the filing of petitioner of a petition for certification election, which had been submitted to conciliation or had become the subject of a valid notice of strike or lockout?\n\nIn the case of Divine Word University of Tacloban v. Secretary of Labor and Employment, [21] we had the occasion to define what a deadlock is, viz:\n\"A 'deadlock' is xxx the counteraction of things producing entire stoppage; xxx There is a deadlock when there is a complete blocking or stoppage resulting from the action of equal and opposed forces xxx. The word is synonymous with the word impasse, which xxx 'presupposes reasonable effort at good faith bargaining which, despite noble intentions, does not conclude in agreement between the parties. ' \" Although there is no \"deadlock\" in its strict sense as there is no \"counteraction\" of forces present in this case nor \"reasonable effort at good faith bargaining, \"such can be attributed to CMC's fault as the bargaining proposals of respondent union were never answered by CMC. In fact, what happened in this case is worse than a bargaining deadlock for CMC employed all legal means to block the certification of respondent union as the bargaining agent of the rank-and-file; and use it as its leverage for its failure to bargain with respondent union. Thus, we can only conclude that CMC was unwilling to negotiate and reach an agreement with respondent union. CMC has not at any instance shown willingness to discuss the economic proposals given by respondent union. [22]\n\nAs correctly ratiocinated by public respondent, to wit:\n\"For herein petitioner to capitalize on the ensuing delay which was caused by the hospital and which resulted in the non-conclusion of a CBA within the certification year, would be to negate and render a mockery of the proceedings undertaken before this Department and to put an unjustified premium on the failure of the respondent hospital to perform its duty to bargain collectively as mandated in Article 252 of the Labor Code, as amended, which states.\"\n\n\"Article 252. Meaning of duty to bargain collectively - the duty to bargain collectively means the performance of a mutual obligation to meet and convene promptly and expeditiously in good faith for the purpose of negotiating an agreement with respect to wages, hours of work and all other terms and conditions of employment including proposals for adjusting any grievance or questions arising under such agreement and executing a contract incorporating such agreements if requested by either party but such duty does not compel any party to agree to a proposal or to make any concession.\"\n\nThe duly certified bargaining agent, CMCEA - AFW, should not be made to further bear the brunt flowing from the respondent hospital's reluctance and thinly disguised refusal to bargain.\" [23] If the law proscribes the conduct of a certification election when there is a bargaining deadlock submitted to conciliation or arbitration, with more reason should it not be conducted if, despite attempts to bring an employer to the negotiation table by the certified bargaining agent, there was \"no reasonable effort in good faith\" on the employer to bargain collectively.\n\nIn the case of Kaisahan ng Manggagawang Pilipino vs. Trajano, 201 SCRA 453 (1991), penned by Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa, the factual milieu of which is similar to this case, this Court allowed the holding of a certification election and ruled that the one year period known as the \"certification year\" has long since expired. We also ruled, that:\n\n\"xxx prior to the filing of the petition for election in this case, there was no such 'bargaining deadlock xx (which) had been submitted to conciliation or arbitration or had become the subject of a valid notice of strike or lockout.' To be sure, there are in the record assertions by NAFLU that its attempts to bring VIRON to the negotiation table had been unsuccessful because of the latter's recalcitrance, and unfulfilled promises to bargain collectively; but there is no proof that it had taken any action to legally coerce VIRON to comply with its statutory duty to bargain collectively. It could have charged VIRON with unfair labor practice; but it did not. It could have gone on a legitimate strike in protest against VIRON's refusal to bargain collectively and compel it to do so; but it did not. There are assertions by NAFLU, too, that its attempts to bargain collectively had been delayed by continuing challenges to the resolution pronouncing it the sole bargaining representative in VIRON; but there is no adequate substantiation thereof , or of how it did in fact prevent initiation of the bargaining process between it and VIRON.\" [24] Although the statements pertinent to this case are merely obiter, still the fact remains that in the Kaisahan case, NAFLU was counselled by this Court on the steps that it should have undertaken to protect its interest, but which it failed to do so.\n\nThis is what is strikingly different between the Kaisahan case and the case at bench for in the latter case, there was proof that the certified bargaining agent, respondent union, had taken an action to legally coerce the employer to comply with its statutory duty to bargain collectively, i. e., charging the employer with unfair labor practice and conducting a strike in protest against the employer's refusal to bargain. [25] It is only just and equitable that the circumstances in this case should be considered as similar in nature to a \"bargaining deadlock\" when no certification election could be held. This is also to make sure that no floodgates will be opened for the circumvention of the law by unscrupulous employers to prevent any certified bargaining agent from negotiating a CBA. Thus, Section 3, Rule V, Book V of the Implement Rules should be interpreted liberally so as to include a circumstance, e. g. where a CBA could not be concluded due to the failure of one party to willingly perform its duty to bargain collectively.\n\nThe order for the hospital to bargain is based on its failure to bargain collectively with respondent union.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Resolution dated November 18, 1994 of public respondent Laguesma is AFFIRMED and the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\nPadilla, Bellosillo, Vitug, and Kapunan, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] NCR-00-M-9403-052.\n\n[2] Rollo, pp. 145-153.\n\n[3] Rollo, pp. 154-158.\n\n[4] Rollo, pp. 164-169.\n\n[5] Rollo, pp. 172-173.\n\n[6] Rollo, pp. 174-176.\n\n[7] Rollo, pp. 177-178.\n\n[8] Rollo, pp. 199-203.\n\n[9] Rollo, p. 281.\n\n[10] Rollo, p. 282.\n\n[11] Rollo, p. 283.\n\n[12] Rollo, pp. 209-210.\n\n[13] Rollo, pp. 26-31.\n\n[14] Ibid.\n\n[15] Rollo, pp. 71-77.\n\n[16] Rollo, pp. 33-41.\n\n[17] Ibid.\n\n[18] Rollo, pp. 43-44.\n\n[19] Rollo, p. 351.\n\n[20] Rollo, p. 14.\n\n[21] 213 SCRA 759 (1992).\n\n[22] cf.

      "title": "also modifying the CIAC Decision. Hanjin then sought reconsideration but the CA similarly denied the motion via a Resolution of October 14, 2005.[5] Hanjin then interposed a petition for review docketed as G.R. No. 170144, questioning the decision and resolution of the CA.The FactsThe facts, as found by the CIAC and the CA, are as follows:On August 23, 1999, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) awarded to Hanjin the contract for the construction of the Project for the aggregate sum of PhP 1,701,353,495.92, 65% of which is payable in Philippine peso and the remaining 35% in US dollars at the stipulated exchange rate of PhP 34.10 to USD 1.[6] Thereafter, steps were taken and negotiations undertaken towards a sub-contracting arrangement between Hanjin and Dynamic.On February 28, 2000, Hanjin and Dynamic executed a Subcontract Agreement over a 76.5% portion of the main contract for the price of PhP 924,670,819.[7] Among others, the subcontract contained provisions on down or advance payment and progress billing, the first item payable within 20 days from contract signing.[8] To note, progress billings represent claims for payment for works accomplished and materials delivered as construction progresses.As drawn, the subcontract was a unit price, as distinguished from a lump sum, agreement. As such, the quantities specified therein and upon which the subcontract price was determined were provisional. Accordingly, after re-measuring and after determining actual quantities required for the works on the basis of changes in the specifications, the estimated quantities were substantially reduced. The reduction resulted in an adjustment of the subcontract price to PhP 714,868,129.[9]As of January 2000, Dynamic already mobilized its equipment and manpower, albeit it has yet to receive a Notice to Proceed from Hanjin. This advance accommodating arrangement was made so that the mobilization would coincide with the Notice to Proceed that the DOTC issued to Hanjin. By March 2000, when it received a Notice to Proceed from Hanjin, Dynamic had already spent a tidy sum for mobilization purposes.In a clear breach of the subcontract agreement which obligated Hanjin to give Dynamic an advance/down payment within 20 days from contract execution,[10] Hanjin paid Dynamic the stipulated down payment in 10 installments spread over a six-month period. Payments for Dynamic's progress billings likewise came late and also effected in installments, when the subcontract called for progress billing payment within seven working days from the payment by the client (DOTC) to the contractor (Hanjin).[11]It may be stated at this stage that shortly after the subcontract signing, Dynamic secured a US dollar denominated loan from GRB Capital, Inc. (GRB) of California. As security for the loan, Dynamic agreed to assign its receivables from the Project to GRB, but Hanjin opposed the security arrangement on the ground that the assignment might interfere with Dynamic's performance.Prior to the start of the construction works, Dynamic engaged the services of Gregorio E. Origenes, a structural engineer with 38-years experience behind him, to check on the designs of the Project. After examining the plans and specifications for the Project, Origenes found that \"[t]he depth of the girder was undersigned [sic] considering the length of the beam and considering further that no post tensioning cables were provided; and [t]he framing system of the beams and girders was poorly designed.\"[12]Dynamic called Hanjin's attention to such design deficiency. But upon the prodding of Hanjin which relied on a contrary assessment of the Davao Airport Consultants (DAC), Dynamic nonetheless proceeded with the construction as designed. The flawed design would later, however, manifest themselves by cracks appearing in the beams to the second floor slab in the Passenger Terminal Building. Initially, Hanjin considered such defects as construction in nature attributable to Dynamic, not design defects. However, the Association of Structural Engineers of the Philippines, Task Force Davao International Airport, upon investigation, discovered no evidence of deviation from the design plans and specifications, and stated the opinion that there is a failure of structural design for some of the beams and girders of Passenger Terminal Buildings 1 and 2.[13]To address the adverted design defect, Dynamic recommended post-tensioning. However, Hanjin balked at this recommendation. Eventually, Hanjin and the DAC approved the use of carbon fiber as post-tensioning material of the structures to be used by a new subcontractor, the Composite Technology Corporation.[14]On December 31, 2000, the parties executed a modificatory Supplementary Agreement[15] in a bid to ensure the timely completion of the Project, with Hanjin assisting Dynamic in the scheduled works. Under this supplementary contract, Hanjin would, among other things, take over the responsibility for canvassing of quotations, procurement, and delivery of materials and installation works. Dynamic would still provide for temporary facilities, such as scaffoldings, formwork materials, and the like.[16]As of April 2002, 89% of the Project had been finished. Hanjin would, however, inform Dynamic that no progress billing payment would be forthcoming after April 2002. As of that time, a total of 20 progress billings were submitted to Hanjin in the total amount of PhP 582,103,359.35, 10% of which, or over PhP 58.2 million, was retained by Hanjin.[17] By December 2002, when project works had reached a 94% completion level, Hanjin took over the Project for the reason of alleged abandonment.[18] Dynamic was thus impelled to demand payment from Hanjin for work done on the Project, which then went unheeded.Such was the state of things when Dynamic submitted its claim against Hanjin for arbitration to the CIAC. In its Answer, Hanjin made counterclaims, such as costs of takeover, contractual negative balance, and damages.At the CIAC, the parties entered into a Terms of Reference whereby the issues they raised were embodied, viz:Is Claimant [Dynamic] entitled to the release of its retention amounting to P58,210,336.00 when DOTC released to the Respondent [Hanjin] the retained amount of P89,492,594.56?Is Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of escalation cost and/or price adjustment amounting to P60,000,000.00?Is Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of a foreign currency adjustment in the amount of P160,688,069.00?Is Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of its work accomplishments valued at P27,790,675.00?Whether or not Claimant is entitled to claim payment at 40% mark-up of the following variation orders: (1) Variation Order amounting to P219,171,878.00 x 40% = P87,668,722.00; (2) Variation Order amounting to P60,923,533.00 x 40% = P24,369,413.20?Is Claimant entitled to its claim for payment for the installation of three systems of arrival carousel in the amount of P34,297,691.91?x x x xIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment for interest computed at the rate of 12% per annum in the amount of P51,288,786.36?Was respondent guilty of bad faith and deceit in its dealings with the Claimant when (a) it released the down payment in installments; x x x (c) it delayed payment of progress billings; (d) it refused to release to the Claimant 35% of the foreign currency portion of its contract with DOTC; x x x (f) it overpriced the materials it purchased for the Claimant under the Supplementary Agreement between the parties, and claimed reimbursement for materials for which it failed to produce supporting receipts and also claimed reimbursement for transporting materials from abroad using unreasonable and unacceptable method of transporting materials?Were there deductions from the work accomplishments of Claimant, which were unauthorized and undue? Did the Claimant abandon the works? If it did, is the Claimant liable to Respondent for additional expenses it incurred in completing the work in the aggregate amount of P107,459,925.51?Is Claimant liable for the claim x x x, for the cost of the supplies, materials and equipment, inclusive of taxes and customs duties, supplied by the Respondent x x x for the performance of the Subcontracted Works?

If so, did it call the attention of the Respondent to this deficiency? Did the Respondent instruct the Claimant to proceed with the construction of the shop drawings and the construction of the buildings? Did cracks occur in the concrete beams of the buildings causing the DOTC through its consultant to provide procedures for correction of the defects and determine their cause? x x x Who between Claimant and Respondent is liable for the cost of retrofitting the cracked slabs and beams?Is the Claimant liable for the claims of Respondent, described generally as \"Contractual Negative Balance\" x x x ?Is Claimant liable to Respondent for delay x x x ?Is the Claimant liable to the Respondent for x x x moral damages x x x and attorney's fees x x x ?Is Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of attorney's fees in the amount of P25,554,857.55?[19]The following is a summary of the parties' claims and counterclaims submitted before the CIAC: [DYNAMIC'S CLAIMS:] Retention Money P 58,210,336.00 Escalation Cost/Price Adjustment 60,000,000.00 Foreign Currency Adjustment 60,688,069.00 Work Accomplishments 27,790,675.00 Variation Orders 53,119,284.73 Interest for Late Payments 51,288,786.36 Attorney's Fees _____ ____25,554,857.55 P 536,652,008.64 [HANJIN'S COUNTERCLAIMS:] Contractual Negative Balance P 121,273,314.00 Increase Manpower 81,486,997.00 Equipment 635,500.00 Electrical Consumption 419,939.16 Miscellaneous Materials 481,734.81 Liquidated Damages 12,600,000.00 Expenses for Preparation of Final Drawing 11,705,354.12 Miscellaneous Expenses of Claimant's Subcontractors 130,500.00 Moral Damages 1,000,000.00 Exemplary Damages 1,000,000.00 Attorney's Fees _____ _____2,000,000.00 P 232,733,339.51[20] Thereafter, the CIAC issued a Final Award awarding the following amounts for the items as indicated: The total credits to Dynamic are: Adjusted Subcontract Price P 1,028,932,282.36 Share in Profit in VOs 9,295,667.94 Materials Over-purchased _____ _______54,847,739.30 TOTAL P 1,093,075,739.30 The total deductions are: Payment, Progress Billings Nos. 1-20 P 582,103,359.35 Net Cost to Complete 368,578,828.92 Repayment Un-recouped Advance Payment ______ ________16,398,419.74 TOTAL P_____ _______967,080,608.01 x x x x BALANCE P 125,995,131.29[21] Following the denial of Dynamic's Motion to Correct Award per the CIAC's Order of September 24, 2004,[22] both parties appealed to the CA.The Rulings of the Court of AppealsIn CA-G.R. SP No. 86633, the CA rendered the first appealed Decision dated January 28, 2005, veritably affirming the factual findings of the CIAC, but nonetheless modified the latter's ruling insofar only as the award of attorney's fees, rate of interest imposable, and liability for arbitration fees were concerned. The fallo of the January 28, 2005 CA Decision reads:WHEREFORE, the assailed CIAC Final Award dated September 7, 2004 is MODIFIED and/or RECTIFIED as follows: (a) to order the parties to equally share the costs of arbitration conformably with Article 24 of their Subcontract Agreement; (b) to delete the award of attorney's fees in favor of respondent [Dynamic]; and, (c) to reduce the rate of interest imposable after the finality of the award from 15% to 12% per annum. The rest is AFFIRMED in toto.[23]The CA would subsequently deny Hanjin's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution of October 14, 2005.On the other hand, the appellate court's Decision dated July 6, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641 dispositively reads:Foregoing premises considered we vote to GRANT the instant petition. The Final Award dated September 7, 2004 in CIAC Case No. 07-2004 is hereby MODIFIED; the net award shall be computed as follows: Original Subcontract Price PhP 714,868,129.00 Foreign Currency Adjustment 131,338,674.80 Price Escalation 48,171,585.32 Variation Orders ______ _______156,786,932.62 Adjusted Subcontract Price PhP 1,051,165,321.74 x x x x Share in Profit in VOs 61,400,096.07 Materials Over-Purchased ______ ________54,847,789.94 Total PhP 1,167,413,207.75 Less: Total Deductions Progress Billings Nos. 1-20 net of retention money 523,893,023.35 Net Cost to Complete 368,578,828.92 Repayment, Unrecouped Advance Payment __16,398,419.74 908,870,252.01 Net Award PhP 258,542,935.74 ===== ================= The net award in favor of petitioner Dynamic x x x shall be [PhP 258,542,935.74] plus attorney's fees of [PhP 500,000].

The cost of arbitration, however, should be equally borne by the parties in accordance with Article 24 of the Subcontract Agreement.SO ORDERED.[25]From the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86633, Hanjin has come to this Court on a Petition for Review on Certiorari, the same docketed as G.R. No. 170144. And from the more adverse CA Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, Hanjin also filed a similar petition, docketed as G.R. No. 169408.In a Resolution dated February 28, 2007,[26] this Court consolidated the above cases.The IssuesHanjin raises identical issues in both of its petitions, to wit:IWHETHER A REVIEW OF THE INSTANT CASE BY WAY OF THE INSTANT PETITION FOR REVIEW IS WARRANTEDIIWHETHER THE [CA] ERRONEOUSLY READ INTO THE SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT EXTRANEOUS AND CONTRACTUALLY INEXISTENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO LAMELY JUSTIFY ITS AWARD TO RESPONDENT DYNAMIC OF PAYMENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCYIIIWHETHER THE [CA'S] AWARD OF PRICE ESCALATION IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENT DYNAMIC IS WITH LEGAL BASISIVWHETHER THE [CA'S] IMPOSITION OF CERTAIN ITEMS, PERCENTAGES AND AMOUNTS IN RESPONDENT DYNAMIC'S CLAIM TO VARIATION ORDERS IS WITH LEGAL BASISVWHETHER THE [CA] WAS LEGALLY JUSTIFIED IN ITS COMPUTATION WITH REGARD TO THE ITEMS ON COSTS TO COMPLETE IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER HANJINVIWHETHER THE [CA] COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT DISREGARDED THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHED ON RECORD BY REWARDING RESPONDENT DYNAMIC PAYMENT OF RETENTION MONEY DESPITE ITS ABANDONMENT OF THE SUBCONTRACTED WORKSVIIWHETHER PETITIONER HANJIN IS LEGALLY ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST OF ATTORNEY'S FEES, MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGESVIIIWHETHER THERE WAS LEGAL BASIS FOR THE [CA'S] RULING THAT RESPONDENT DYNAMIC IS ENTITLED TO INTEREST PAYMENT[27]The Ruling of the CourtThe Propriety of the Petitions for Review Dynamic maintains that the issues Hanjin raised in its petitions are factual in nature and are, therefore, not proper subject of review under Section 1 of Rule 45, prescribing that a petition under the said rule, like the one at bench, \"shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.\"Dynamic's contention is valid to point as, indeed, the matters raised by Hanjin are factual, revolving as they do on the entitlement of Dynamic to the awards granted and computed by the CIAC and the CA. Generally, this would be a question of fact that this Court would not delve upon. Imperial v. Jaucian suggests as much. There, the Court ruled that the computation of outstanding obligation is a question of fact:Arguing that she had already fully paid the loan x x x, petitioner alleges that the two lower courts misappreciated the facts when they ruled that she still had an outstanding balance of P208,430.This issue involves a question of fact. Such question exists when a doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged facts; and when there is need for a calibration of the evidence, considering mainly the credibility of witnesses and the existence and the relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probabilities of the situation.[28] (Emphasis supplied.)The rule, however, precluding the Court from delving on the factual determinations of the CA, admits of several exceptions. In Fuentes v. Court of Appeals, we held that the findings of facts of the CA, which are generally deemed conclusive, may admit review by the Court in any of the following instances, among others:(1) when the factual findings of the [CA] and the trial court are contradictory;(2) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;(3) when the inference made by the [CA] from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;(4) when there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;(5) when the [CA], in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;(6) when the judgment of the [CA] is premised on a misapprehension of facts;(7) when the [CA] fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;(8) when the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;(9) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and(10) when the findings of fact of the [CA] are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record.[29]Significantly, jurisprudence teaches that mathematical computations as well as the propriety of the arbitral awards are factual determinations.[30] And just as significant is that the factual findings of the CIAC and CA--in each separate appealed decisions--practically dovetail with each other. The perceptible essential difference, at least insofar as the CIAC's Final Award and the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641 are concerned, rests merely on mathematical computations or adjustments of baseline amounts which the CIAC may have inadvertently utilized.At any rate, the challenge hurled by Hanjin against the merits of the CA's findings, particularly those embodied in its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, must fail, such findings being fully supported by, or deducible from, the evidence on record.Issue of Payment in Foreign CurrencyHanjin argues that there is no provision in the subcontract agreement, as supplemented, for the partial payment of the contract price in foreign currency.Hanjin is wrong, a peso-dollar payment mix being effectively contemplated in the subcontract. In construing a contract, the provisions thereof should not be read in isolation, but in relation to each other and in their entirety so as to render them effective, having in mind the intention of the parties and the purpose to be achieved.[31] Thus, Article 1374 of the Civil Code provides that \"the various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which result from all of them taken jointly.\"In other words, the stipulations in a contract and other contract documents should be interpreted together with the end in view of giving effect to all.[32] The CA, as did the CIAC, found the Hanjin-Dynamic Subcontract Agreement as including and incorporating the provisions of other agreements entered into by and between the parties respecting the Project. They appropriately cited Art. 1 of the Subcontract Agreement, stating:ARTICLE 1. SUBCONTRACT DOCUMENTS1.1) The following documents shall be deemed to form and be read and be construed as an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement in the same order of precedence as below: a) Subcontract Agreement No. DAV-2-Sub-A-OO 1 b) Special Conditions as the Annex 1 c) General Conditions of the Main Contract d) Technical Specifications of the Main Contract e) Tender Drawings f) Priced Bill of Quantities as the Annex 2. 1.2) The Subcontractor is deemed to have examined and fully understood the aforesaid Subcontract Agreement Documents.[33] (Emphasis supplied.)It is abundantly clear from the emphasized portions of the aforequoted provision that the DOTC-Hanjin Main Contract forms as \"an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement.\" It is settled that if the terms of a contract leave no doubt as to the parties' intention, the literal meaning of its stipulations should control.[34] The categorical finding of the CA, affirmatory of that of the CIAC, was that \"the Subcontract is a back-to-back contract with Hanjin's contract with DOTC.\" Under the Main Contract, DOTC undertook to pay Hanjin 35% of the contract price in US dollars. Be that as it may, and on the postulate that the Main Contract is an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement, it behooves Hanjin to extend to Dynamic the same benefits otherwise accruing to Hanjin under the Main Contract. Apart from dollar payment, other benefits contemplated include the payment of price adjustment or escalation. An application of the \"back-to-back\" arrangement between Hanjin and Dynamic to the contrary would be tantamount to a construction against the terms of the Subcontract Agreement.Before the CIAC, Hanjin argued that Dynamic's entitlement to a share in the foreign currency portion of the contract price is conditioned on the completion of the Project by April 2002.[35] The CIAC, however, correctly made short shrift of this argument, tagging the condition to be an impossible one and noting that Hanjin's very act of releasing advance payments to Dynamic in trickles, rather than in one full payment, as agreed upon, and delaying payments for approved progress billings ensured that Dynamic would not meet the April 2002 deadline. The CA, it bears to stress, echoed these CIAC findings, and stated the observation that Hanjin's actions not only delayed the Project, but also rendered its completion on the date imposed by Hanjin impossible. Hanjin, therefore, cannot plausibly fault and penalize Dynamic for not meeting the imposed deadline, the latter having in its favor Art. 1186 of the Civil Code, which says that \"[t]he condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment.\"Given the above perspective, the condition imposed for Dynamic's entitlement to a share in Hanjin's foreign currency receipts is, for the nonce, deemed fulfilled. Accordingly, there is no legal obstacle to the award of a foreign currency adjustment to Dynamic. Furthermore, Hanjin's admission before the CIAC that Dynamic is entitled to a foreign currency portion of the subcontract price veritably placed Hanjin in estoppel from claiming otherwise. Under the doctrine of estoppel, an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon.[36]Issue of Computation of Foreign Currency AdjustmentAs to the amount of foreign currency adjustment due Dynamic, the CIAC arrived at the figure PhP 131,338,674.80. The CA agreed with the CIAC's computation and the ratiocination therefor. We reproduce with approval what the CIAC wrote:Dynamic's Subcontract Price of P714,868,129.00 is 76% of what Hanjin will derive from DOTC for the Subcontract Works. 35% of this amount represents the foreign currency portion of the Subcontract Price. This amounts to P250,203,845.00. At the exchange rate of Hanjin which is P34.10: US$1, this amount of P250,203,845.00 is equivalent to US$7,337,356.15. Converted again into its value in pesos at the time when the Subcontract was performed which ranged from P50.00 to P54.00 to US$1, or an average rate of P52.00: US$1, its peso equivalent is P381,542,519.80. This is the rate used by Hanjin in charging Dynamic for the peso value of the importation of foreign materials. The difference between P381,542,519.80 and P250,203,845.00 is P131,338,674.80. We award to Dynamic as its share of the foreign currency portion of the Subcontract Price the amount of P131,338,674.80 which shall be added to the Subcontract Price.[37]Issue of Applicable Exchange RateHanjin questions the PhP 52: USD 1 exchange rate adopted by the CA and by the CIAC earlier, asserting that what is applicable is the PhP 34.10: USD 1 exchange rate, the same being stipulated in the DOTC-Hanjin Main Contract.Hanjin's assertion may be accorded some cogency but for the fact that, as the CA and the CIAC found, Hanjin charged Dynamic for all the costs related to the importation of raw materials to be used in the Project at the average exchange rate of PhP 52.00: USD 1. And as the CA aptly observed, the \"Subcontract called for the importation of a substantial amount of equipment and materials for the project.\" We need not belabor the iniquitousness of the lopsided formula foisted by Hanjin and the undue enrichment resulting therefrom.Issue of Computation of Total EscalationHanjin assails the CA for failing to use the 52 formulas and price indexes from the National Statistics Office and the National Statistical Coordination Board in computing the escalation cost or price adjustment. Alternatively, it argues that if Dynamic is indeed entitled to any price escalation, then the applicable figure is 35% of price index only. Notably, Hanjin admitted before the CIAC that Dynamic is entitled to price escalation of PhP 25,938,545.94 for the local portion,[38] which amount the CIAC awarded to Dynamic. In view of such admission, Hanjin's arguments contesting the award for price escalation are puerile.As against, however, the CIAC's computation of escalation cost which the CIAC predicated on works accomplished as of April 2002 and covered by the 20 progress billings, the Court is inclined to sustain the CA's computation of the price escalation as summarized in its Resolution of August 31, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, for the CA rightfully took into account Dynamic's accomplishment after April 2000 but before Hanjin took over the Project, thus:x x x. In Our assailed Decision [of July 6, 2005], We granted [Dynamic] additional escalation as to the \"local portion\" i.e., on 65% of [Dynamic] billings based on the formula: [Dynamic] Billing multiplied by 65% of the said billing, multiplied by the percentage of the escalation. However, We computed escalation of the total amount of PhP 545,162,305.61 because the CIAC computed escalation up to this extent only. It appears that a total of twenty (20) progress billings have been submitted by [Dynamic] to Hanjin because it was advised that no payments were forthcoming for subsequent progress billings.x x x xThis being the case, We have no recourse but to limit the award of escalation only up to the period covered by Progress Billing No. 20 or up to April 2002 as the value of all subsequent accomplishments remained undetermined. It appears however, that the total amount billed up to the time was PhP 582,103,359.35. We have computed escalation only up to the PhP 545,162,035.61 or short as to PhP 36,941,052.74. Applying the formula mentioned above, an additional [PhP 5,573,112.07] is due [Dynamic] as escalation computed: PhP 36,941,053.74 x 65% x 0.2321, over and above PhP 22,233,039.38, so that a total of [PhP 27,806,151.45] is due [Dynamic] as additional escalation over and above that computed by the CIAC.[39]As it were, the records do not show that Hanjin presented any of the supposed 52 formulas and price indexes, the utilization of which would have resulted, so it claims, in a more exact price escalation figure. Hanjin did not adduce any evidence to provide legal support to its assertion that the price escalation portion to which Dynamic is entitled to is 35% of the price index only. The Court agrees with the CA that, in computing price escalation, the allowable escalation is to be pegged on the local portion, that is, on 65% of the Dynamic billing multiplied by 100% price index, because Dynamic is entitled to both price adjustment and price escalation under the Subcontract Agreement.As may be noted, the CA initially followed the baseline amount used by the CIAC in computing the amount of price escalation at PhP 545,162,305.61. However, after another look at the case, the CA found the CIAC to have erred in starting at the figure of PhP 582,103,359.35 as the baseline amount which, as earlier indicated, represented the total billing as of April 2002. Accordingly, the CA granted a total award of PhP 27,806,151.45 by adding the amount of PhP 5,573,112.07 to its previous award of PhP 22,233,039.38 to Dynamic based on the corrected computation. At bottom then, the CA merely corrected its own computation error, a process which it can undoubtedly do as long as jurisdiction over the matter has not been lost, as here.[40]Issue of Computation of Variation OrderHanjin also challenges the CA's computation of Dynamic's share in the profit in the Variation Orders (VOs). The CA, in its July 6, 2005 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, found the amount of Dynamic's share in the VOs to be PhP 61,400,096.07, up from the PhP 9,295,667.94 awarded by the CIAC. On reconsideration, the CA returned to the original CIAC figure. Instead, in its August 31, 2005 Resolution, the appellate court deducted the whole amount of PhP 104,208,856.26 from Hanjin's Net Cost to Complete Claim. This amount represented the cost of materials with the overcharge component passed by Hanjin to Dynamic. The CA arrived at the figure of PhP 104,208,856.26 after a painstaking, itemized comparison of the items and amounts common in the Tables of Variance submitted by the parties in the two tables.We see no reason to disturb the CA's findings which appear to be supported by the evidence on record. The computation of awards is, to stress, purely factual which the Court, not being a trier of facts, need not evaluate and analyze all over again.On another point, Hanjin argues that the original contract price on the items subject to VOs should be added to the DOTC-approved amount for the same items. And from this sum total should be deducted the amount representing what the CA considered as overcharging Hanjin passed onto Dynamic. According to Hanjin, the amount it was charging Dynamic represents the actual cost of work done on the items subject to VOs. Hanjin's posture would necessarily diminish the amount allegedly overcharged by Hanjin to Dynamic.The Court is not convinced. At the outset, we find Hanjin's presentation of a partial list[41] in its Memorandum of the items each party is charging the other quite disturbing. As the petitioner in this case, Hanjin is charged with the burden of establishing the grave error allegedly committed by the CA in its computation of the overcharged amount. Its failure to provide a complete and clear computation of what it considers as the correct one militates against the supposed merit of its argument.Hanjin's own annexes to its Petition indicate the deleted items from the original subcontract price of PhP 924,670,819, as follows:melo Original Subcontract Price PhP 924,670,819.00 Deleted after re-measurement PhP 118,338,206.31 Deleted due change of specifications subject to VOs 91,464,481.64 209,802,687.95 PhP 714,868,129.05[42] ============== Also pertinent is a list of VOs[43] approved by the DOTC with an aggregate amount of PhP 37,326,381.54,[44] corresponding to the same items previously deleted, as shown above, amounting to PhP 91,464,481.64.Hanjin presently asks the Court to add the original subcontract price of the items subject to VOs, that is, PhP 91,464,481.64, to the DOTC- approved amount for the corresponding VOs in the amount of PhP 37,326,381.54, the sum of which to be deducted from the amount of PhP 141,535,238.92[45] which Hanjin is charging Dynamic to arrive at the amount of the overcharge.Hanjin knows fully well that the amount of PhP 91,464,481.64 covers items deleted from the contract price by reason of the VOs. Such deleted items lowered the original aggregate subcontract price from PhP 924,670,819 to PhP 714,868,129. The amount of PhP 91,464,481.64, representing items already deleted by reason of VOs, has been superseded by the succeeding changes in specifications which the DOTC approved in the amount of PhP 37,326,381.54. Hence, only the amount approved by the DOTC for the items actually installed should be the subject of computation. The amounts representing items already deleted should necessarily be excluded from the computation.From the foregoing consideration, it is unreasonable for Hanjin to charge Dynamic the amount of PhP 141,535,238.92 for the items subject to VOs when DOTC actually approved only PhP 37,326,381.54 for the same items. And lest it be overlooked, Dynamic was credited only the amount approved by DOTC at PhP 37,326,381.54 of the subject VOs. To charge Dynamic more than the approved amount for the VOs would result in an overcharging on the part of Hanjin.Issue on Computation of Hanjin's Net Cost to CompleteAs regards the issue of disallowed deductions from Hanjin's Net Cost to Complete, the CA, in its underlying decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, included the amount of PhP 8,558,652.78 and PhP 1,257,417.30, being not properly receipted, as additional disallowed deductions to the CIAC's figure of PhP 84,166,970.47[46] or a total disallowable deduction of PhP 93,983,040.38.[47] We agree and thus affirm the CA's holding that when expenses or offered deductions are not properly documented, such deductions should not be allowed, such deductions being in the nature of actual damages. To be recoverable, actual damages must be pleaded and adequately proven in court. An award thereof cannot be predicated on flimsy, remote, speculative, and insubstantial proof.[48] Again, we see no reason to deviate from the CA's findings on the matter of how much Hanjin expended to complete the Project.To be sure, the Court cannot close its eyes to the consistent findings of the appellate court, affirmatory of that of the CIAC, that Hanjin padded expenses chargeable against Dynamic. Consider the following apt observations of the CIAC on the computation of deductions Hanjin charged Dynamic under \"Net Cost to Complete\":The Dynamic Summary is divided into two parts: The first part covered all purchases, payments to subcontractors and all expenses deducted from Dynamic's progress billings nos. 1 to 20. We reviewed the Dynamic Summary to ascertain the expenses that are questioned. We assume that those not questioned are admitted to be proper expenses and are deductible from the [adjusted subcontract price]. We agree with Dynamic that we should disallow certain items for the following reasons:The expense is outside the scope of work of Dynamic;The expense relates to an item that is subject to a prior deduction; in other words, in the cases of double deduction.The expense is undocumented.We came across a substantial number of imported items where there was a material variance between the value of an imported item as reflected in a Customs declaration and the value reflected in private documents. The value reflected in the Bureau of Customs declaration is less, in some cases, substantially less than that reflected in other documents. We chose to rely on the value in the Bureau of Customs declaration. First, because it is a public document. Second, because if the case is one in which Hanjin undervalued the imported goods, which is a criminal act, we will not allow it to profit from its own wrong.[49]Issue of Dynamic's Abandonment of WorkHanjin claims as being entitled to other costs which it incurred when Dynamic later abandoned the subcontracted works in December 2002. Both the issues of \"other costs\" and \"abandonment\" are factual matters settled in the proceedings below. The CIAC findings argue against the notion of abandonment on the part of Dynamic. Wrote the CIAC:Even if it were true, as argued by Hanjin, that there were other aspects of the work that could have been aggressively pursued by Dynamic, it could have given the guarantee requested by Dynamic that it will be paid even if DOTC does not in turn pay Hanjin for the same work. Moreover, the admission by Hanjin that after the April 2002 progress billings, it did not pay Dynamic for work it had accomplished, in our view, provides sufficient legal justification for not continuing with the work. Article 1169 [of the] Civil Code, invoked by Dynamic provides:ART. 1169. In reciprocal obligations, neither party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with what is incumbent upon him. From the moment one of the parties fulfills the obligation, delay by the other begins.Under the Subcontract, Dynamic agreed to perform the Subcontract Works in consideration for which Hanjin agreed to pay Dynamic the stipulated Subcontract Price in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Subcontract. The payment for performing the Subcontract Works consisted of an advance payment exclusively to cover the costs of mobilization and monthly progress payments within seven (7) days after DOTC pays Hanjin. [Hanjin has not argued] that DOTC was remiss in the payment of Hanjin's progress billings. Clearly, therefore, there was failure on the part of Hanjin to comply with its obligation to pay Dynamic. Thus, we hold that x x x Dynamic did not abandon the Works. As will be shown later, Dynamic was squeezed out of the Subcontract and was rendered by Hanjin incapable of performing its obligations therein. Under Article 1186 of the Civil Code, \"The condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment.\"[50] (Emphasis supplied.)In its Resolution dated August 31, 2005, the CA sustained the CIAC's finding on non-abandonment, as follows:[T]he CIAC found that [Dynamic] did not abandon the subcontract works, but that it was squeezed out of the Subcontract and was rendered by Hanjin incapable of performing the obligations therein. It found certain circumstances to justify the suspension of work by [Dynamic], to wit: that [Dynamic] was forced to de-mobilize because it was not being paid for work undertaken; that the issue of retrofitting had not been resolved; and that the manner of retrofitting still had to be decided upon. Despite the same, [Dynamic] continued with the work not affecting the retrofitting work, but Hanjin terminated the Subcontract. The CIAC thus held that Hanjin, the obligor, in voluntarily preventing the fulfillment by [Dynamic], the obligee, of its obligation, the condition was deemed fulfilled.[51]It cannot be overemphasized that conclusions arrived at on factual issues by the CIAC, when affirmed by the CA, are accorded great respect and even finality, if supported by substantial evidence.[52] In the instant case, both the CIAC and the CA found more than ample evidence to support Dynamic's disclaimer of having abandoned the Project.The Court concurs with the parallel findings of the CIAC and the CA on the issue of abandonment. Indeed, Hanjin, by its unjustifiable and unfair actions, veritably forced Dynamic out of the Project at a time when the subcontract works were already 94% complete. In net effect, Hanjin accepted the benefits arising from the subcontract agreement without as much as asking Dynamic to finish its part of the bargain. Under Art. 1235 of the Civil Code, the obligation is deemed fully complied with when an obligee accepts the performance thereof knowing its incompleteness or irregularity, and without expressing any protest or objection. An obligee is deemed to have waived strict compliance by an obligor with an obligation when the following elements are present: (1) an intentional acceptance of the defective or incomplete performance; (2) with actual knowledge of the incompleteness or defect; and (3) under circumstances that would indicate an intention to consider the performance as complete and renounce any claim arising from the defect.[53]These elements obtain in the instant case. At the time it \"booted out\" Dynamic from the Project, Hanjin knew that the subcontract works were not yet complete. In fact, there were unresolved matters involving structural design deficiencies and the methods to be used in the retrofitting of the cracked slabs and beams in the Passenger Terminal Building. Hanjin served notice that it will not pay the progress billings for works done after April 2000. In December 2002, it refused entry to Dynamic's workers at the project site. Hanjin took all these actions without demanding that Dynamic finish its contractual undertaking. By operation of law, Hanjin is thus deemed to have waived its right to claim any payment for expenses it incurred in completing the unfinished six percent of the work. No reversible error can thus be attributed to the CA in refusing to allow additional completion costs to Hanjin.Issue of Dynamic's Entitlement to Retention MoneyHanjin, as stated at the outset, refused to release Dynamic's retention money on the ground of abandonment and non-completion of the Project. Arts. 6.2, 7, and 8.3 of the Subcontract Agreement, relating to the matter on retention money, respectively read, as follows:6.2) Monthly progress billing calculated on the basis of actual works measured and sixty percent (60%) of the material costs of the delivered goods according to the Bill of quantities, x x x shall be paid with deductions of advance payment stipulated in Article 6.1 and ten percent (10%) of billing amount as the retention money stipulated in Article 7.1 for the period covered. Monthly progress billing[s] shall be paid by the Contractor and to the Subcontractor within seven (7) working days after the Client pays the Contractor.x x x xARTICLE 7. RETENTION7.1) The retention money, ten percent (10%) of every progress billing with cumulative amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Subcontract Price shall be deducted therefrom in order to secure the remedy of defects.7.2) Fifty percent (50%) of the retention money shall be released to the Subcontractor immediately after the Contractor issues the \"Taking Over Certificate\" to the Subcontractor and against presentation of Warranty Bond x x x valid for the duration of the Defects Liability Period specified in Article 8.The other fifty percent (50%) retention shall be released pro rata, if no defects have been found, after the Client releases retention money to the Contractor, after the Subcontractor issues a Clearance Certificate to the Contractor attesting that the Contractor is free from all liens and encumbrances in relation to the Subcontract Works and after the Subcontractor submits an acceptable Warranty Bond to the Contractor which is valid until the defects liability period of the Main Contract plus 2 months.x x x x8.3) Defects Liability Period shall be three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of issuance of the Taking Over Certificate. Within this period, the Subcontractor shall repair and make good all defects in the Subcontract Works at his own cost x x x. The Subcontractor shall assume full and sole responsibility for the removal, repair and replacement of any defective or non- conforming works.[54] x x xThe retention money, as described above, is intended to ensure defect and deficiency-free work as evidenced by the contractor's issuance of a Take Over Certificate. Hanjin, as contractor, never issued this key document to Dynamic. Instead, it discharged Dynamic from the 94%-done Project rendering the issuance of such certificate a virtual impossibility. On June 1, 2003, the DOTC issued a Take Over Certificate to Hanjin and released the latter's retention money under the Main Contract. But even earlier, the DOTC released Hanjin's retention money covering the period February 2000 to December 2001, a development which would have obligated Hanjin to release the corresponding Dynamic's retention money for the same period. But instead of paying, Hanjin held onto Dynamic's retention money. Worse still, Hanjin willfully and in apparent bad faith took over the unfinished work of Dynamic. To us, and to CIAC and the CA earlier, Hanjin in effect waived any and all of its rights to hold Dynamic liable for any defects, deficiencies, or unfinished work. Consequently, there is no legal basis for Hanjin to further withhold payment of Dynamic's retention money.Issue of Entitlement to Moral and Exemplary DamagesHanjin's ascription of bad faith and gross negligence on the part of Dynamic, as basis for its claim of attorney's fees against the latter, has nothing to commend itself for concurrence. In fact, both the CIAC and CA are one in saying that it was Hanjin which acted in bad faith in its contractual relation with Dynamic. The CIAC, in awarding attorney's fees to Dynamic, categorically stated:On the basis of the evidence before us, we do not find any basis to hold Dynamic liable to Hanjin for x x x damages and attorney's fees. On the other hand, on the basis of our finding that Hanjin acted in bad faith and had persistently acted in a manner that we interpret as attempts to squeeze out Dynamic from the Subcontract, and for attempting to pass on to Dynamic a part of the cost of retrofitting when, it is clear from the evidence, it was free from fault, and all the difficulties encountered by Dynamic in trying to enforce its rights under the Subcontract, we should find Hanjin liable to pay Dynamic exemplary damages but we cannot award exemplary damages as they are not part of the claim of Dynamic. x x x We, however, award attorney's fees of P500,000.00.[55]Issue of Entitlement to Attorney's FeesThe Subcontract Agreement, as supplemented, is silent as to payment of attorney's fees. The applicable law, Art. 2208 of the Civil Code, must thus govern any award thereof. It reads:ART. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered except:x x x x2) When the defendant's acts or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect its interest;x x x x5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiffs plainly valid, just and demandable claim;x x x x11) In any case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.An award of attorney's fees being the exception,[56] some compelling legal reason must obtain to bring the case within the exception and justify such award. In the case at bench, there is a categorical finding by the CIAC and CA that Hanjin's refusal to satisfy Dynamic's just claims amounted to gross and evident bad faith. This to us presents the justifying ingredient for the award of attorney's fees. Accordingly, we affirm the award of attorney's fees in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641 to Dynamic in the amount of PhP 500,000.Issue of Computation of InterestThe Court of Appeals Erred in Its Award of Interest PaymentIn its appealed Resolution of August 31, 2005, the CA decreed that:[Hanjin] x x x is hereby ordered to pay [Dynamic] the amount of [PhP 293,952,273.36]; plus interest at 12% per annum from the promulgation of the assailed Final Award on September 7, 2004, until paid. Hanjin is likewise ordered to release to [Dynamic] the retention money in the amount of PhP 58,210,336.00, plus interest at 12% per annum from the time the Request for Arbitration was filed with the CIAC on February 20, 2004, until fully paid.[57] x x xIn the landmark case of Eastern Shipping Lines v. Court of Appeals, the Court summarized the rules on interest award, as follows:II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.[58]The contract under consideration does not partake of a loan or forbearance of money; it is a construction contract. Thus, the matter of interest award proceeding from the dispute would fall under the second paragraph of the above-quoted decision.The reckoning point in the determination of the period of application of the six percent interest is from the time extrajudicial demand is made. In the instant case, the Terms of Reference submitted before the CIAC shows that, in a letter dated November 20, 2003, Dynamic served notice that should Hanjin fail to pay the former's claims, the case shall be submitted for arbitration. Thus, the six percent interest due shall start to run from November 20, 2003 until the award becomes final and executory. Only then will the 12% interest referred to in the aforequoted third paragraph of Eastern Shipping Lines start to run until the same is paid.WHEREFORE, the CA Decision dated July 6, 2005, as modified by the Resolution dated August 31, 2005, both rendered in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, are hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the interest to be imposed on the sum total of the net award (PhP 293,952,273.36) and retention money (PhP 58,210,336) awarded to Dynamic shall be six percent (6%) interest per annum, reckoned from November 20, 2003 until the total award becomes final and executory. A yearly interest of twelve percent (12%) on the total amount adjudged by the CIAC, as modified in the CA Resolution and further modified by this Decision, as due to Dynamic, shall be assessed against Hanjin, computed from the finality of the CIAC Final Award, as thus modified, until the final satisfaction thereof.Insofar as they are inconsistent with this Decision, the CA Decision dated January 28, 2005 and Resolution dated October 14, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 86633 are MODIFIED accordingly.The petitions of Hanjin are PARTIALLY GRANTED in a sense as above discussed.Costs against Hanjin.SO ORDERED.Quisumbing, Carpio Morales, Tinga, and Brion, JJ., concur.[1] Rollo (G.R.

Nos. 169408 & 170144, April 30, 2008 ]\n[ G.R. Nos. 169408 & 170144, April 30, 2008 ]\n\nHANJIN HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD., Petitioner, vs. DYNAMIC PLANNERS AND VELASCO, JR., and CONSTRUCTION CORP., Respondent.D E C I S I O N\nHANJIN HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD., Petitioner, vs. DYNAMIC PLANNERS AND VELASCO, JR., and CONSTRUCTION CORP., Respondent.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nVELASCO JR., J.:\n\nCentral to the dispute between petitioner Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Co., Ltd. (Hanjin), as contractor, and respondent Dynamic Planners and Construction Corporation (Dynamic), as subcontractor, is the Davao International Airport Project (Project). Hanjin seeks a reversal of the decision rendered by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC), as affirmed with modifications by the Court of Appeals (CA).\n\nIt is Hanjin's basic posture that Dynamic was in delay in the prosecution of, and eventually abandoned, the Project, prompting Hanjin to complete the same. Hanjin thus claims that Dynamic should not be entitled to the retention money and should instead be held liable for damages.\n\nDynamic denies having abandoned the Project, then nearing completion, some time in December 2002, but admits suspending work thereon on account of Hanjin's act of withholding the release of the down payment and the payment of its progress billing. Dynamic claims being entitled to the release of its retention money, to partial payment in foreign currency, and to payment for escalation costs.\n\nThe parties question certain items covered by the award, the corresponding amount due for each item, and the computations adopted first by the CIAC and then by the CA in arriving at a final award.\n\nThe Case\n\nThe instant Petitions for Review on Certiorari, both filed under Rule 45, arose from CIAC Case No. 07-2004 entitled Dynamic Planners & Construction Corporation v. Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co., Ltd. , a request for arbitration initiated by Dynamic before the CIAC. On September 7, 2004, the CIAC rendered a decision denominated as Final Award, [1] allowing and ordering payment of most of Dynamic's claims, albeit on lowered amounts. Therefrom, both parties appealed to the CA, Dynamic's appeal docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, while that of Hanjin's as CA-G.R. SP No. 86633. The separate appeals were eventually raffled to and resolved by different divisions of the CA.\n\nOn July 6, 2005, in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, the CA rendered a Decision, [2] modifying the CIAC's decision, the modification favoring Dynamic. Hanjin's motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA per its Resolution dated August 31, 2005. [3] Hanjin thus filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari dated October 20, 2005 docketed as G.R. No. 169408, assailing the above CA decision and resolution.\n\nEarlier, in CA-G.R. SP No. 86633, the CA issued a Decision dated January 28, 2005, [4] also modifying the CIAC Decision. Hanjin then sought reconsideration but the CA similarly denied the motion via a Resolution of October 14, 2005. [5] Hanjin then interposed a petition for review docketed as G.R. No. 170144, questioning the decision and resolution of the CA.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe facts, as found by the CIAC and the CA, are as follows:\n\nOn August 23, 1999, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) awarded to Hanjin the contract for the construction of the Project for the aggregate sum of PhP 1,701,353,495.92, 65% of which is payable in Philippine peso and the remaining 35% in US dollars at the stipulated exchange rate of PhP 34.10 to USD 1. [6] Thereafter, steps were taken and negotiations undertaken towards a sub-contracting arrangement between Hanjin and Dynamic.\n\nOn February 28, 2000, Hanjin and Dynamic executed a Subcontract Agreement over a 76.5% portion of the main contract for the price of PhP 924,670,819 . [7] Among others, the subcontract contained provisions on down or advance payment and progress billing, the first item payable within 20 days from contract signing. [8] To note, progress billings represent claims for payment for works accomplished and materials delivered as construction progresses.\n\nAs drawn, the subcontract was a unit price, as distinguished from a lump sum, agreement. As such, the quantities specified therein and upon which the subcontract price was determined were provisional. Accordingly, after re-measuring and after determining actual quantities required for the works on the basis of changes in the specifications, the estimated quantities were substantially reduced. The reduction resulted in an adjustment of the subcontract price to PhP 714,868,129 . [9]\n\nAs of January 2000, Dynamic already mobilized its equipment and manpower, albeit it has yet to receive a Notice to Proceed from Hanjin. This advance accommodating arrangement was made so that the mobilization would coincide with the Notice to Proceed that the DOTC issued to Hanjin. By March 2000, when it received a Notice to Proceed from Hanjin, Dynamic had already spent a tidy sum for mobilization purposes.\n\nIn a clear breach of the subcontract agreement which obligated Hanjin to give Dynamic an advance/down payment within 20 days from contract execution, [10] Hanjin paid Dynamic the stipulated down payment in 10 installments spread over a six-month period. Payments for Dynamic's progress billings likewise came late and also effected in installments, when the subcontract called for progress billing payment within seven working days from the payment by the client (DOTC) to the contractor (Hanjin). [11]\n\nIt may be stated at this stage that shortly after the subcontract signing, Dynamic secured a US dollar denominated loan from GRB Capital, Inc. (GRB) of California. As security for the loan, Dynamic agreed to assign its receivables from the Project to GRB, but Hanjin opposed the security arrangement on the ground that the assignment might interfere with Dynamic's performance.\n\nPrior to the start of the construction works, Dynamic engaged the services of Gregorio E. Origenes, a structural engineer with 38-years experience behind him, to check on the designs of the Project. After examining the plans and specifications for the Project, Origenes found that \"[t]he depth of the girder was undersigned [sic] considering the length of the beam and considering further that no post tensioning cables were provided; and [t]he framing system of the beams and girders was poorly designed.\" [12]\n\nDynamic called Hanjin's attention to such design deficiency. But upon the prodding of Hanjin which relied on a contrary assessment of the Davao Airport Consultants (DAC), Dynamic nonetheless proceeded with the construction as designed. The flawed design would later, however, manifest themselves by cracks appearing in the beams to the second floor slab in the Passenger Terminal Building. Initially, Hanjin considered such defects as construction in nature attributable to Dynamic, not design defects. However, the Association of Structural Engineers of the Philippines, Task Force Davao International Airport, upon investigation, discovered no evidence of deviation from the design plans and specifications, and stated the opinion that there is a failure of structural design for some of the beams and girders of Passenger Terminal Buildings 1 and 2. [13]\n\nTo address the adverted design defect, Dynamic recommended post-tensioning. However, Hanjin balked at this recommendation. Eventually, Hanjin and the DAC approved the use of carbon fiber as post-tensioning material of the structures to be used by a new subcontractor, the Composite Technology Corporation. [14]\n\nOn December 31, 2000, the parties executed a modificatory Supplementary Agreement [15] in a bid to ensure the timely completion of the Project, with Hanjin assisting Dynamic in the scheduled works. Under this supplementary contract, Hanjin would, among other things, take over the responsibility for canvassing of quotations, procurement, and delivery of materials and installation works. Dynamic would still provide for temporary facilities, such as scaffoldings, formwork materials, and the like. [16]\n\nAs of April 2002, 89% of the Project had been finished. Hanjin would, however, inform Dynamic that no progress billing payment would be forthcoming after April 2002. As of that time, a total of 20 progress billings were submitted to Hanjin in the total amount of PhP 582,103,359.35 , 10% of which, or over PhP 58.2 million, was retained by Hanjin. [17] By December 2002, when project works had reached a 94% completion level, Hanjin took over the Project for the reason of alleged abandonment. [18] Dynamic was thus impelled to demand payment from Hanjin for work done on the Project, which then went unheeded.\n\nSuch was the state of things when Dynamic submitted its claim against Hanjin for arbitration to the CIAC. In its Answer, Hanjin made counterclaims, such as costs of takeover, contractual negative balance, and damages.\n\nAt the CIAC, the parties entered into a Terms of Reference whereby the issues they raised were embodied, viz:\nIs Claimant [Dynamic] entitled to the release of its retention amounting to P58,210,336.00 when DOTC released to the Respondent [Hanjin] the retained amount of P89,492,594.56?\n\nIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of escalation cost and/or price adjustment amounting to P60,000,000.00?\n\nIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of a foreign currency adjustment in the amount of P160,688,069.00?\n\nIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of its work accomplishments valued at P27,790,675.00?\n\nWhether or not Claimant is entitled to claim payment at 40% mark-up of the following variation orders: (1) Variation Order amounting to P219,171,878.00 x 40% = P87,668,722.00; (2) Variation Order amounting to P60,923,533.00 x 40% = P24,369,413.20?\n\nIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment for the installation of three systems of arrival carousel in the amount of P34,297,691.91?\n\nx x x x\n\nIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment for interest computed at the rate of 12% per annum in the amount of P51,288,786.36?\n\nWas respondent guilty of bad faith and deceit in its dealings with the Claimant when (a) it released the down payment in installments; x x x (c) it delayed payment of progress billings; (d) it refused to release to the Claimant 35% of the foreign currency portion of its contract with DOTC; x x x (f) it overpriced the materials it purchased for the Claimant under the Supplementary Agreement between the parties, and claimed reimbursement for materials for which it failed to produce supporting receipts and also claimed reimbursement for transporting materials from abroad using unreasonable and unacceptable method of transporting materials?\n\nWere there deductions from the work accomplishments of Claimant, which were unauthorized and undue? Did the Claimant abandon the works? If it did, is the Claimant liable to Respondent for additional expenses it incurred in completing the work in the aggregate amount of P107,459,925.51?\n\nIs Claimant liable for the claim x x x, for the cost of the supplies, materials and equipment, inclusive of taxes and customs duties, supplied by the Respondent x x x for the performance of the Subcontracted Works? If so, how much of this claim is Respondent entitled to x x x ?\n\nWas the Claimant (i) mismanaged, (ii) lacking in capacity to perform the Subcontracted Works, (iii) lacking in technical Know-how x x x (iv) lacking in expert engineers and qualified manpower x x x (v) financially incapable of accomplishing the Subcontracted Works x x x ?\n\nDid Claimant discover the deficiency in the structural design of the buildings to be constructed by it, namely: (i) the Passenger Terminal Building, (ii) the ATC-Administration Building, and (iii) the Central Plant Building? If so, did it call the attention of the Respondent to this deficiency? Did the Respondent instruct the Claimant to proceed with the construction of the shop drawings and the construction of the buildings? Did cracks occur in the concrete beams of the buildings causing the DOTC through its consultant to provide procedures for correction of the defects and determine their cause? x x x Who between Claimant and Respondent is liable for the cost of retrofitting the cracked slabs and beams?\n\nIs the Claimant liable for the claims of Respondent, described generally as \"Contractual Negative Balance\" x x x ?\n\nIs Claimant liable to Respondent for delay x x x ?\n\nIs the Claimant liable to the Respondent for x x x moral damages x x x and attorney's fees x x x ?\n\nIs Claimant entitled to its claim for payment of attorney's fees in the amount of P25,554,857.55?

SP No. 86633, the CA rendered the first appealed Decision dated January 28, 2005, veritably affirming the factual findings of the CIAC, but nonetheless modified the latter's ruling insofar only as the award of attorney's fees, rate of interest imposable, and liability for arbitration fees were concerned. The fallo of the January 28, 2005 CA Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , the assailed CIAC Final Award dated September 7, 2004 is MODIFIED and/or RECTIFIED as follows: (a) to order the parties to equally share the costs of arbitration conformably with Article 24 of their Subcontract Agreement ; (b) to delete the award of attorney's fees in favor of respondent [Dynamic]; and, (c) to reduce the rate of interest imposable after the finality of the award from 15% to 12% per annum. The rest is AFFIRMED in toto .

The cost of arbitration, however, should be equally borne by the parties in accordance with Article 24 of the Subcontract Agreement.\n\nSO ORDERED. [25]\nFrom the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86633, Hanjin has come to this Court on a Petition for Review on Certiorari, the same docketed as G.R. No. 170144. And from the more adverse CA Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, Hanjin also filed a similar petition, docketed as G.R. No. 169408.\n\nIn a Resolution dated February 28, 2007, [26] this Court consolidated the above cases.\n\nThe Issues\n\nHanjin raises identical issues in both of its petitions, to wit:\nI\n\nWHETHER A REVIEW OF THE INSTANT CASE BY WAY OF THE INSTANT PETITION FOR REVIEW IS WARRANTED\n\nII\n\nWHETHER THE [CA] ERRONEOUSLY READ INTO THE SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT EXTRANEOUS AND CONTRACTUALLY INEXISTENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO LAMELY JUSTIFY ITS AWARD TO RESPONDENT DYNAMIC OF PAYMENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY\n\nIII\n\nWHETHER THE [CA'S] AWARD OF PRICE ESCALATION IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENT DYNAMIC IS WITH LEGAL BASIS\n\nIV\n\nWHETHER THE [CA'S] IMPOSITION OF CERTAIN ITEMS, PERCENTAGES AND AMOUNTS IN RESPONDENT DYNAMIC'S CLAIM TO VARIATION ORDERS IS WITH LEGAL BASIS\n\nV\n\nWHETHER THE [CA] WAS LEGALLY JUSTIFIED IN ITS COMPUTATION WITH REGARD TO THE ITEMS ON COSTS TO COMPLETE IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER HANJIN\n\nVI\n\nWHETHER THE [CA] COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT DISREGARDED THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHED ON RECORD BY REWARDING RESPONDENT DYNAMIC PAYMENT OF RETENTION MONEY DESPITE ITS ABANDONMENT OF THE SUBCONTRACTED WORKS\n\nVII\n\nWHETHER PETITIONER HANJIN IS LEGALLY ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST OF ATTORNEY'S FEES, MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n\nVIII\n\nWHETHER THERE WAS LEGAL BASIS FOR THE [CA'S] RULING THAT RESPONDENT DYNAMIC IS ENTITLED TO INTEREST PAYMENT [27]\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe Propriety of the Petitions for Review\n\nDynamic maintains that the issues Hanjin raised in its petitions are factual in nature and are, therefore, not proper subject of review under Section 1 of Rule 45, prescribing that a petition under the said rule, like the one at bench, \"shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.\"\n\nDynamic's contention is valid to point as, indeed, the matters raised by Hanjin are factual, revolving as they do on the entitlement of Dynamic to the awards granted and computed by the CIAC and the CA. Generally, this would be a question of fact that this Court would not delve upon. Imperial v. Jaucian suggests as much. There, the Court ruled that the computation of outstanding obligation is a question of fact:\n\nArguing that she had already fully paid the loan x x x, petitioner alleges that the two lower courts misappreciated the facts when they ruled that she still had an outstanding balance of P208,430.\n\nThis issue involves a question of fact . Such question exists when a doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged facts; and when there is need for a calibration of the evidence, considering mainly the credibility of witnesses and the existence and the relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probabilities of the situation. [28] (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nThe rule, however, precluding the Court from delving on the factual determinations of the CA, admits of several exceptions. In Fuentes v. Court of Appeals , we held that the findings of facts of the CA, which are generally deemed conclusive, may admit review by the Court in any of the following instances, among others:\n(1) when the factual findings of the [CA] and the trial court are contradictory;\n\n(2) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;\n\n(3) when the inference made by the [CA] from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;\n\n(4) when there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;\n\n(5) when the [CA], in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;\n\n(6) when the judgment of the [CA] is premised on a misapprehension of facts;\n\n(7) when the [CA] fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;\n\n(8) when the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;\n\n(9) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and\n\n(10) when the findings of fact of the [CA] are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record. [29]\nSignificantly, jurisprudence teaches that mathematical computations as well as the propriety of the arbitral awards are factual determinations. [30] And just as significant is that the factual findings of the CIAC and CA--in each separate appealed decisions--practically dovetail with each other. The perceptible essential difference, at least insofar as the CIAC's Final Award and the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641 are concerned, rests merely on mathematical computations or adjustments of baseline amounts which the CIAC may have inadvertently utilized.\n\nAt any rate, the challenge hurled by Hanjin against the merits of the CA's findings, particularly those embodied in its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, must fail, such findings being fully supported by, or deducible from, the evidence on record.\n\nIssue of Payment in Foreign Currency\n\nHanjin argues that there is no provision in the subcontract agreement, as supplemented, for the partial payment of the contract price in foreign currency.\n\nHanjin is wrong, a peso-dollar payment mix being effectively contemplated in the subcontract. In construing a contract, the provisions thereof should not be read in isolation, but in relation to each other and in their entirety so as to render them effective, having in mind the intention of the parties and the purpose to be achieved. [31] Thus, Article 1374 of the Civil Code provides that \"the various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which result from all of them taken jointly.\"\n\nIn other words, the stipulations in a contract and other contract documents should be interpreted together with the end in view of giving effect to all. [32] The CA, as did the CIAC, found the Hanjin-Dynamic Subcontract Agreement as including and incorporating the provisions of other agreements entered into by and between the parties respecting the Project. They appropriately cited Art. 1 of the Subcontract Agreement, stating:\nARTICLE 1. SUBCONTRACT DOCUMENTS\n\n1.1) The following documents shall be deemed to form and be read and be construed as an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement in the same order of precedence as below:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\na) | Subcontract Agreement No. DAV-2-Sub-A-OO 1\nb) | Special Conditions as the Annex 1\nc) | General Conditions of the Main Contract\nd) | Technical Specifications of the Main Contract\ne) | Tender Drawings\nf) | Priced Bill of Quantities as the Annex 2.\n[END_TABLE]\n\na)\n\nSubcontract Agreement No. DAV-2-Sub-A-OO 1 b)\n\nSpecial Conditions as the Annex 1 c) General Conditions of the Main Contract d) Technical Specifications of the Main Contract e) Tender Drawings f) Priced Bill of Quantities as the Annex 2. 1.2) The Subcontractor is deemed to have examined and fully understood the aforesaid Subcontract Agreement Documents. [33] (Emphasis supplied.)\nIt is abundantly clear from the emphasized portions of the aforequoted provision that the DOTC-Hanjin Main Contract forms as \"an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement.\" It is settled that if the terms of a contract leave no doubt as to the parties' intention, the literal meaning of its stipulations should control. [34] The categorical finding of the CA, affirmatory of that of the CIAC, was that \"the Subcontract is a back-to-back contract with Hanjin's contract with DOTC.\" Under the Main Contract, DOTC undertook to pay Hanjin 35% of the contract price in US dollars. Be that as it may, and on the postulate that the Main Contract is an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement, it behooves Hanjin to extend to Dynamic the same benefits otherwise accruing to Hanjin under the Main Contract. Apart from dollar payment, other benefits contemplated include the payment of price adjustment or escalation. An application of the \"back-to-back\" arrangement between Hanjin and Dynamic to the contrary would be tantamount to a construction against the terms of the Subcontract Agreement.\n\nBefore the CIAC, Hanjin argued that Dynamic's entitlement to a share in the foreign currency portion of the contract price is conditioned on the completion of the Project by April 2002. [35] The CIAC, however, correctly made short shrift of this argument, tagging the condition to be an impossible one and noting that Hanjin's very act of releasing advance payments to Dynamic in trickles, rather than in one full payment, as agreed upon, and delaying payments for approved progress billings ensured that Dynamic would not meet the April 2002 deadline. The CA, it bears to stress, echoed these CIAC findings, and stated the observation that Hanjin's actions not only delayed the Project, but also rendered its completion on the date imposed by Hanjin impossible. Hanjin, therefore, cannot plausibly fault and penalize Dynamic for not meeting the imposed deadline, the latter having in its favor Art. 1186 of the Civil Code, which says that \"[t]he condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment.\"\n\nGiven the above perspective, the condition imposed for Dynamic's entitlement to a share in Hanjin's foreign currency receipts is, for the nonce, deemed fulfilled. Accordingly, there is no legal obstacle to the award of a foreign currency adjustment to Dynamic. Furthermore, Hanjin's admission before the CIAC that Dynamic is entitled to a foreign currency portion of the subcontract price veritably placed Hanjin in estoppel from claiming otherwise. Under the doctrine of estoppel, an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon. [36]\n\nIssue of Computation of Foreign Currency Adjustment\n\nAs to the amount of foreign currency adjustment due Dynamic, the CIAC arrived at the figure PhP 131,338,674.80. The CA agreed with the CIAC's computation and the ratiocination therefor. We reproduce with approval what the CIAC wrote:\nDynamic's Subcontract Price of P714,868,129.00 is 76% of what Hanjin will derive from DOTC for the Subcontract Works. 35% of this amount represents the foreign currency portion of the Subcontract Price. This amounts to P250,203,845.00. At the exchange rate of Hanjin which is P34.10: US$1, this amount of P250,203,845.00 is equivalent to US$7,337,356.15. Converted again into its value in pesos at the time when the Subcontract was performed which ranged from P50.00 to P54.00 to US$1, or an average rate of P52.00: US$1, its peso equivalent is P381,542,519.80. This is the rate used by Hanjin in charging Dynamic for the peso value of the importation of foreign materials. The difference between P381,542,519.80 and P250,203,845.00 is P131,338,674.80. We award to Dynamic as its share of the foreign currency portion of the Subcontract Price the amount of P131,338,674.80 which shall be added to the Subcontract Price. [37]\nIssue of Applicable Exchange Rate\n\nHanjin questions the PhP 52: USD 1 exchange rate adopted by the CA and by the CIAC earlier, asserting that what is applicable is the PhP 34.10: USD 1 exchange rate, the same being stipulated in the DOTC-Hanjin Main Contract.\n\nHanjin's assertion may be accorded some cogency but for the fact that, as the CA and the CIAC found, Hanjin charged Dynamic for all the costs related to the importation of raw materials to be used in the Project at the average exchange rate of PhP 52.00: USD 1. And as the CA aptly observed, the \"Subcontract called for the importation of a substantial amount of equipment and materials for the project.\" We need not belabor the iniquitousness of the lopsided formula foisted by Hanjin and the undue enrichment resulting therefrom.\n\nIssue of Computation of Total Escalation\n\nHanjin assails the CA for failing to use the 52 formulas and price indexes from the National Statistics Office and the National Statistical Coordination Board in computing the escalation cost or price adjustment. Alternatively, it argues that if Dynamic is indeed entitled to any price escalation, then the applicable figure is 35% of price index only. Notably, Hanjin admitted before the CIAC that Dynamic is entitled to price escalation of PhP 25,938,545.94 for the local portion, [38] which amount the CIAC awarded to Dynamic. In view of such admission, Hanjin's arguments contesting the award for price escalation are puerile.\n\nAs against, however, the CIAC's computation of escalation cost which the CIAC predicated on works accomplished as of April 2002 and covered by the 20 progress billings, the Court is inclined to sustain the CA's computation of the price escalation as summarized in its Resolution of August 31, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, for the CA rightfully took into account Dynamic's accomplishment after April 2000 but before Hanjin took over the Project, thus:\nx x x. In Our assailed Decision [of July 6, 2005], We granted [Dynamic] additional escalation as to the \"local portion\" i.e. , on 65% of [Dynamic] billings based on the formula: [Dynamic] Billing multiplied by 65% of the said billing, multiplied by the percentage of the escalation. However, We computed escalation of the total amount of PhP 545,162,305.61 because the CIAC computed escalation up to this extent only. It appears that a total of twenty (20) progress billings have been submitted by [Dynamic] to Hanjin because it was advised that no payments were forthcoming for subsequent progress billings.\n\nx x x x\n\nThis being the case, We have no recourse but to limit the award of escalation only up to the period covered by Progress Billing No. 20 or up to April 2002 as the value of all subsequent accomplishments remained undetermined. It appears however, that the total amount billed up to the time was PhP 582,103,359.35. We have computed escalation only up to the PhP 545,162,035.61 or short as to PhP 36,941,052.74. Applying the formula mentioned above, an additional [PhP 5,573,112.07] is due [Dynamic] as escalation computed: PhP 36,941,053.74 x 65% x 0.2321, over and above PhP 22,233,039.38, so that a total of [PhP 27,806,151.45] is due [Dynamic] as additional escalation over and above that computed by the CIAC. [39]\nAs it were, the records do not show that Hanjin presented any of the supposed 52 formulas and price indexes, the utilization of which would have resulted, so it claims, in a more exact price escalation figure. Hanjin did not adduce any evidence to provide legal support to its assertion that the price escalation portion to which Dynamic is entitled to is 35% of the price index only. The Court agrees with the CA that, in computing price escalation, the allowable escalation is to be pegged on the local portion, that is, on 65% of the Dynamic billing multiplied by 100% price index, because Dynamic is entitled to both price adjustment and price escalation under the Subcontract Agreement.\n\nAs may be noted, the CA initially followed the baseline amount used by the CIAC in computing the amount of price escalation at PhP 545,162,305.61. However, after another look at the case, the CA found the CIAC to have erred in starting at the figure of PhP 582,103,359.35 as the baseline amount which, as earlier indicated, represented the total billing as of April 2002. Accordingly, the CA granted a total award of PhP 27,806,151.45 by adding the amount of PhP 5,573,112.07 to its previous award of PhP 22,233,039.38 to Dynamic based on the corrected computation. At bottom then, the CA merely corrected its own computation error, a process which it can undoubtedly do as long as jurisdiction over the matter has not been lost, as here. [40]\n\nIssue of Computation of Variation Order\n\nHanjin also challenges the CA's computation of Dynamic's share in the profit in the Variation Orders (VOs). The CA, in its July 6, 2005 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, found the amount of Dynamic's share in the VOs to be PhP 61,400,096.07, up from the PhP 9,295,667.94 awarded by the CIAC. On reconsideration, the CA returned to the original CIAC figure. Instead, in its August 31, 2005 Resolution, the appellate court deducted the whole amount of PhP 104,208,856.26 from Hanjin's Net Cost to Complete Claim. This amount represented the cost of materials with the overcharge component passed by Hanjin to Dynamic. The CA arrived at the figure of PhP 104,208,856.26 after a painstaking, itemized comparison of the items and amounts common in the Tables of Variance submitted by the parties in the two tables.\n\nWe see no reason to disturb the CA's findings which appear to be supported by the evidence on record. The computation of awards is, to stress, purely factual which the Court, not being a trier of facts, need not evaluate and analyze all over again.\n\nOn another point, Hanjin argues that the original contract price on the items subject to VOs should be added to the DOTC-approved amount for the same items. And from this sum total should be deducted the amount representing what the CA considered as overcharging Hanjin passed onto Dynamic. According to Hanjin, the amount it was charging Dynamic represents the actual cost of work done on the items subject to VOs. Hanjin's posture would necessarily diminish the amount allegedly overcharged by Hanjin to Dynamic.\n\nThe Court is not convinced. At the outset, we find Hanjin's presentation of a partial list [41] in its Memorandum of the items each party is charging the other quite disturbing. As the petitioner in this case, Hanjin is charged with the burden of establishing the grave error allegedly committed by the CA in its computation of the overcharged amount. Its failure to provide a complete and clear computation of what it considers as the correct one militates against the supposed merit of its argument.\n\nHanjin's own annexes to its Petition indicate the deleted items from the original subcontract price of PhP 924,670,819, as follows:melo\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nOriginal Subcontract Price | | PhP 924,670,819.00 | \nDeleted after re-measurement | PhP 118,338,206.31 | | \nDeleted due change of | | | \nspecifications subject to VOs | 91,464,481.64 | | \n | | 209,802,687.95 | \n | | PhP 714,868,129.05[42] | \n | | ============== | \n[END_TABLE]\n\nOriginal Subcontract Price\nPhP 924,670,819.00\n\nDeleted after re-measurement PhP 118,338,206.31\n\nDeleted due change of\n\nspecifications subject to VOs 91,464,481.64\n\n209,802,687.95\n\nPhP 714,868,129.05 [42]\n\n==============\nAlso pertinent is a list of VOs [43] approved by the DOTC with an aggregate amount of PhP 37,326,381.54, [44] corresponding to the same items previously deleted, as shown above, amounting to PhP 91,464,481.64.\n\nHanjin presently asks the Court to add the original subcontract price of the items subject to VOs, that is, PhP 91,464,481.64, to the DOTC- approved amount for the corresponding VOs in the amount of PhP 37,326,381.54, the sum of which to be deducted from the amount of PhP 141,535,238.92 [45] which Hanjin is charging Dynamic to arrive at the amount of the overcharge.\n\nHanjin knows fully well that the amount of PhP 91,464,481.64 covers items deleted from the contract price by reason of the VOs. Such deleted items lowered the original aggregate subcontract price from PhP 924,670,819 to PhP 714,868,129. The amount of PhP 91,464,481.64, representing items already deleted by reason of VOs, has been superseded by the succeeding changes in specifications which the DOTC approved in the amount of PhP 37,326,381.54. Hence, only the amount approved by the DOTC for the items actually installed should be the subject of computation . The amounts representing items already deleted should necessarily be excluded from the computation.\n\nFrom the foregoing consideration, it is unreasonable for Hanjin to charge Dynamic the amount of PhP 141,535,238.92 for the items subject to VOs when DOTC actually approved only PhP 37,326,381.54 for the same items. And lest it be overlooked, Dynamic was credited only the amount approved by DOTC at PhP 37,326,381.54 of the subject VOs. To charge Dynamic more than the approved amount for the VOs would result in an overcharging on the part of Hanjin.\n\nIssue on Computation of Hanjin's Net Cost to Complete\n\nAs regards the issue of disallowed deductions from Hanjin's Net Cost to Complete, the CA, in its underlying decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, included the amount of PhP 8,558,652.78 and PhP 1,257,417.30, being not properly receipted, as additional disallowed deductions to the CIAC's figure of PhP 84,166,970.47 [46] or a total disallowable deduction of PhP 93,983,040.38. [47] We agree and thus affirm the CA's holding that when expenses or offered deductions are not properly documented, such deductions should not be allowed, such deductions being in the nature of actual damages. To be recoverable, actual damages must be pleaded and adequately proven in court. An award thereof cannot be predicated on flimsy, remote, speculative, and insubstantial proof. [48] Again, we see no reason to deviate from the CA's findings on the matter of how much Hanjin expended to complete the Project.\n\nTo be sure, the Court cannot close its eyes to the consistent findings of the appellate court, affirmatory of that of the CIAC, that Hanjin padded expenses chargeable against Dynamic. Consider the following apt observations of the CIAC on the computation of deductions Hanjin charged Dynamic under \"Net Cost to Complete\":\nThe Dynamic Summary is divided into two parts: The first part covered all purchases, payments to subcontractors and all expenses deducted from Dynamic's progress billings nos. 1 to 20. We reviewed the Dynamic Summary to ascertain the expenses that are questioned. We assume that those not questioned are admitted to be proper expenses and are deductible from the [adjusted subcontract price]. We agree with Dynamic that we should disallow certain items for the following reasons:\nThe expense is outside the scope of work of Dynamic;\nThe expense relates to an item that is subject to a prior deduction; in other words, in the cases of double deduction.\nThe expense is undocumented. We came across a substantial number of imported items where there was a material variance between the value of an imported item as reflected in a Customs declaration and the value reflected in private documents. The value reflected in the Bureau of Customs declaration is less, in some cases, substantially less than that reflected in other documents. We chose to rely on the value in the Bureau of Customs declaration. First, because it is a public document. Second, because if the case is one in which Hanjin undervalued the imported goods, which is a criminal act, we will not allow it to profit from its own wrong. [49]\nIssue of Dynamic's Abandonment of Work\n\nHanjin claims as being entitled to other costs which it incurred when Dynamic later abandoned the subcontracted works in December 2002. Both the issues of \"other costs\" and \"abandonment\" are factual matters settled in the proceedings below. The CIAC findings argue against the notion of abandonment on the part of Dynamic. Wrote the CIAC:\nEven if it were true, as argued by Hanjin, that there were other aspects of the work that could have been aggressively pursued by Dynamic, it could have given the guarantee requested by Dynamic that it will be paid even if DOTC does not in turn pay Hanjin for the same work. Moreover, the admission by Hanjin that after the April 2002 progress billings, it did not pay Dynamic for work it had accomplished, in our view, provides sufficient legal justification for not continuing with the work. Article 1169 [of the] Civil Code, invoked by Dynamic provides:\nART. 1169. In reciprocal obligations, neither party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with what is incumbent upon him. From the moment one of the parties fulfills the obligation, delay by the other begins.\nUnder the Subcontract, Dynamic agreed to perform the Subcontract Works in consideration for which Hanjin agreed to pay Dynamic the stipulated Subcontract Price in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Subcontract. The payment for performing the Subcontract Works consisted of an advance payment exclusively to cover the costs of mobilization and monthly progress payments within seven (7) days after DOTC pays Hanjin. [Hanjin has not argued] that DOTC was remiss in the payment of Hanjin's progress billings. Clearly, therefore, there was failure on the part of Hanjin to comply with its obligation to pay Dynamic. Thus, we hold that x x x Dynamic did not abandon the Works . As will be shown later, Dynamic was squeezed out of the Subcontract and was rendered by Hanjin incapable of performing its obligations therein. Under Article 1186 of the Civil Code, \"The condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment. \" [50] (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn its Resolution dated August 31, 2005, the CA sustained the CIAC's finding on non-abandonment, as follows:\n[T]he CIAC found that [Dynamic] did not abandon the subcontract works, but that it was squeezed out of the Subcontract and was rendered by Hanjin incapable of performing the obligations therein. It found certain circumstances to justify the suspension of work by [Dynamic], to wit: that [Dynamic] was forced to de-mobilize because it was not being paid for work undertaken; that the issue of retrofitting had not been resolved; and that the manner of retrofitting still had to be decided upon. Despite the same, [Dynamic] continued with the work not affecting the retrofitting work, but Hanjin terminated the Subcontract. The CIAC thus held that Hanjin, the obligor, in voluntarily preventing the fulfillment by [Dynamic], the obligee, of its obligation, the condition was deemed fulfilled. [51]\nIt cannot be overemphasized that conclusions arrived at on factual issues by the CIAC, when affirmed by the CA, are accorded great respect and even finality, if supported by substantial evidence. [52] In the instant case, both the CIAC and the CA found more than ample evidence to support Dynamic's disclaimer of having abandoned the Project.\n\nThe Court concurs with the parallel findings of the CIAC and the CA on the issue of abandonment. Indeed, Hanjin, by its unjustifiable and unfair actions, veritably forced Dynamic out of the Project at a time when the subcontract works were already 94% complete. In net effect, Hanjin accepted the benefits arising from the subcontract agreement without as much as asking Dynamic to finish its part of the bargain. Under Art. 1235 of the Civil Code, the obligation is deemed fully complied with when an obligee accepts the performance thereof knowing its incompleteness or irregularity, and without expressing any protest or objection. An obligee is deemed to have waived strict compliance by an obligor with an obligation when the following elements are present: (1) an intentional acceptance of the defective or incomplete performance; (2) with actual knowledge of the incompleteness or defect; and (3) under circumstances that would indicate an intention to consider the performance as complete and renounce any claim arising from the defect. [53]\n\nThese elements obtain in the instant case. At the time it \"booted out\" Dynamic from the Project, Hanjin knew that the subcontract works were not yet complete. In fact, there were unresolved matters involving structural design deficiencies and the methods to be used in the retrofitting of the cracked slabs and beams in the Passenger Terminal Building. Hanjin served notice that it will not pay the progress billings for works done after April 2000. In December 2002, it refused entry to Dynamic's workers at the project site. Hanjin took all these actions without demanding that Dynamic finish its contractual undertaking. By operation of law, Hanjin is thus deemed to have waived its right to claim any payment for expenses it incurred in completing the unfinished six percent of the work. No reversible error can thus be attributed to the CA in refusing to allow additional completion costs to Hanjin.\n\nIssue of Dynamic's Entitlement to Retention Money\n\nHanjin, as stated at the outset, refused to release Dynamic's retention money on the ground of abandonment and non-completion of the Project. Arts. 6.2, 7, and 8.3 of the Subcontract Agreement, relating to the matter on retention money, respectively read, as follows:\n6.2) Monthly progress billing calculated on the basis of actual works measured and sixty percent (60%) of the material costs of the delivered goods according to the Bill of quantities, x x x shall be paid with deductions of advance payment stipulated in Article 6.1 and ten percent (10%) of billing amount as the retention money stipulated in Article 7.1 for the period covered. Monthly progress billing[s] shall be paid by the Contractor and to the Subcontractor within seven (7) working days after the Client pays the Contractor.\nx x x x\n\nARTICLE 7. RETENTION\n\n7.1) The retention money, ten percent (10%) of every progress billing with cumulative amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Subcontract Price shall be deducted therefrom in order to secure the remedy of defects.\n\n7.2) Fifty percent (50%) of the retention money shall be released to the Subcontractor immediately after the Contractor issues the \"Taking Over Certificate\" to the Subcontractor and against presentation of Warranty Bond x x x valid for the duration of the Defects Liability Period specified in Article 8.\n\nThe other fifty percent (50%) retention shall be released pro rata, if no defects have been found, after the Client releases retention money to the Contractor, after the Subcontractor issues a Clearance Certificate to the Contractor attesting that the Contractor is free from all liens and encumbrances in relation to the Subcontract Works and after the Subcontractor submits an acceptable Warranty Bond to the Contractor which is valid until the defects liability period of the Main Contract plus 2 months.\n\nx x x x\n\n8.3) Defects Liability Period shall be three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of issuance of the Taking Over Certificate. Within this period, the Subcontractor shall repair and make good all defects in the Subcontract Works at his own cost x x x. The Subcontractor shall assume full and sole responsibility for the removal, repair and replacement of any defective or non- conforming works. [54] x x x\nThe retention money, as described above, is intended to ensure defect and deficiency-free work as evidenced by the contractor's issuance of a Take Over Certificate. Hanjin, as contractor, never issued this key document to Dynamic. Instead, it discharged Dynamic from the 94%-done Project rendering the issuance of such certificate a virtual impossibility. On June 1, 2003, the DOTC issued a Take Over Certificate to Hanjin and released the latter's retention money under the Main Contract. But even earlier, the DOTC released Hanjin's retention money covering the period February 2000 to December 2001, a development which would have obligated Hanjin to release the corresponding Dynamic's retention money for the same period. But instead of paying, Hanjin held onto Dynamic's retention money. Worse still, Hanjin willfully and in apparent bad faith took over the unfinished work of Dynamic. To us, and to CIAC and the CA earlier, Hanjin in effect waived any and all of its rights to hold Dynamic liable for any defects, deficiencies, or unfinished work. Consequently, there is no legal basis for Hanjin to further withhold payment of Dynamic's retention money.\n\nIssue of Entitlement to Moral and Exemplary Damages\n\nHanjin's ascription of bad faith and gross negligence on the part of Dynamic, as basis for its claim of attorney's fees against the latter, has nothing to commend itself for concurrence. In fact, both the CIAC and CA are one in saying that it was Hanjin which acted in bad faith in its contractual relation with Dynamic. The CIAC, in awarding attorney's fees to Dynamic, categorically stated:\nOn the basis of the evidence before us, we do not find any basis to hold Dynamic liable to Hanjin for x x x damages and attorney's fees. On the other hand, on the basis of our finding that Hanjin acted in bad faith and had persistently acted in a manner that we interpret as attempts to squeeze out Dynamic from the Subcontract, and for attempting to pass on to Dynamic a part of the cost of retrofitting when, it is clear from the evidence, it was free from fault, and all the difficulties encountered by Dynamic in trying to enforce its rights under the Subcontract, we should find Hanjin liable to pay Dynamic exemplary damages but we cannot award exemplary damages as they are not part of the claim of Dynamic. x x x We, however, award attorney's fees of P500,000.00. [55]\nIssue of Entitlement to Attorney's Fees\n\nThe Subcontract Agreement, as supplemented, is silent as to payment of attorney's fees. The applicable law, Art. 2208 of the Civil Code, must thus govern any award thereof. It reads:\nART. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered except:\n\nx x x x\n\n2) When the defendant's acts or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect its interest;\n\nx x x x\n\n5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiffs plainly valid, just and demandable claim;\n\nx x x x\n\n11) In any case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.\nAn award of attorney's fees being the exception, [56] some compelling legal reason must obtain to bring the case within the exception and justify such award. In the case at bench, there is a categorical finding by the CIAC and CA that Hanjin's refusal to satisfy Dynamic's just claims amounted to gross and evident bad faith. This to us presents the justifying ingredient for the award of attorney's fees. Accordingly, we affirm the award of attorney's fees in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641 to Dynamic in the amount of PhP 500,000.\n\nIssue of Computation of Interest\n\nThe Court of Appeals Erred in Its Award of Interest Payment\n\nIn its appealed Resolution of August 31, 2005, the CA decreed that:\n[Hanjin] x x x is hereby ordered to pay [Dynamic] the amount of [PhP 293,952,273.36]; plus interest at 12% per annum from the promulgation of the assailed Final Award on September 7, 2004, until paid. Hanjin is likewise ordered to release to [Dynamic] the retention money in the amount of PhP 58,210,336.00, plus interest at 12% per annum from the time the Request for Arbitration was filed with the CIAC on February 20, 2004, until fully paid. [57] x x x\nIn the landmark case of Eastern Shipping Lines v. Court of Appeals , the Court summarized the rules on interest award, as follows:\nII. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:\nWhen the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e ., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, i.e ., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.\n\nWhen an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum . No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.\n\nWhen the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit. [58]\nThe contract under consideration does not partake of a loan or forbearance of money; it is a construction contract. Thus, the matter of interest award proceeding from the dispute would fall under the second paragraph of the above-quoted decision.\n\nThe reckoning point in the determination of the period of application of the six percent interest is from the time extrajudicial demand is made. In the instant case, the Terms of Reference submitted before the CIAC shows that, in a letter dated November 20, 2003, Dynamic served notice that should Hanjin fail to pay the former's claims, the case shall be submitted for arbitration. Thus, the six percent interest due shall start to run from November 20, 2003 until the award becomes final and executory. Only then will the 12% interest referred to in the aforequoted third paragraph of Eastern Shipping Lines start to run until the same is paid.\n\nWHEREFORE , the CA Decision dated July 6, 2005, as modified by the Resolution dated August 31, 2005, both rendered in CA-G.R. SP No. 86641, are hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the interest to be imposed on the sum total of the net award (PhP 293,952,273.36) and retention money (PhP 58,210,336) awarded to Dynamic shall be six percent (6%) interest per annum, reckoned from November 20, 2003 until the total award becomes final and executory. A yearly interest of twelve percent (12%) on the total amount adjudged by the CIAC, as modified in the CA Resolution and further modified by this Decision, as due to Dynamic, shall be assessed against Hanjin, computed from the finality of the CIAC Final Award, as thus modified, until the final satisfaction thereof.\n\nInsofar as they are inconsistent with this Decision, the CA Decision dated January 28, 2005 and Resolution dated October 14, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 86633 are MODIFIED accordingly.\n\nThe petitions of Hanjin are PARTIALLY GRANTED in a sense as above discussed.\n\nCosts against Hanjin.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, Carpio Morales, Tinga , and Brion , JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo (G.R.

CARANYAGAN, DANETH FETALVERO AND DELTA MILLING INDUSTRIES, INC.,RESPONDENTS D E C I S I O N AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.: Assailed in the present Petition for Review on Certiorari is the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision[1] dated October 21, 2002 and Resolution[2] dated February 13, 2004, dismissing the petition filed by Jaguar Security and Investigation Agency (petitioner) and affirming the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) Resolutions dated September 19, 2000 and November 9, 2001.The facts of the case, as narrated by the CA, are undisputed:Petitioner Jaguar Security and Investigation Agency (\"Jaguar\") is a private corporation engaged in the business of providing security services to its clients, one of whom is Delta Milling Industries, Inc. (\"Delta\").Private respondents Rodolfo Sales, Melvin Tamayo, Dionisio Caranyagan, Jesus Silva, Jr., Jaime Moron and Daneth Fetalvero were hired as security guards by Jaguar. They were assigned at the premises of Delta in Libis, Quezon City. Caranyagan and Tamayo were terminated by Jaguar on May 26, 1998 and August 21, 1998, respectively. Allegedly their dismissals were arbitrary and illegal. Sales, Moron, Fetalvero and Silva remained with Jaguar. All the guard-employees, claim for monetary benefits such as underpayment, overtime pay, rest day and holiday premium pay, underpaid 13th month pay, night shift differential, five days service and incentive leave pay. In addition to these money claims, Caranyagan and Tamayo argue that they were entitled to separation pay and back wages, for the time they were illegally dismissed until finality of the decision. Furthermore, all respondents claim for moral and exemplary damages.On September 18, 1998, respondent security guards instituted the instant labor case before the labor arbiter.x x x xOn May 25, 1999, the labor arbiter rendered a decision in favor of private respondents Sales, et al., the dispositive portion of which provides:\"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the charges of illegal dismissal on the part of the complainants MELVIN R. TAMAYO and DIONISIO C. CARANYAGAN for lack of merit but ordering respondents JAGUAR SECURITY AND INVESTIGATION AGENCY and DELTA MILLING INDUSTRIES, INC., to jointly and severally pay all the six complainants, namely: RODOLFO A. SALES, MELVIN R. TAMAYO, JAIME MORON and DANETH FETALVERO the following money claims for their services rendered from April 24, 1995 to April 24, 1998:a) wage differentialsb) overtime pay differentials (4 hours a day)c) rest day payd) holiday paye) holiday premium payf) 13th month pay differentialsg) five days service incentive leave pay per year subject to the exception earlier cited.The Research and Information Unit of this Commission is hereby directed to compute and quantify the above awards and submit a report thereon within 15 days from receipt of this decision.For purposes of any appeal, the appeal bond is tentatively set at P100,000.00.All other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.SO ORDERED.\"On July 1, 1999, petitioner Jaguar filed a partial appeal questioning the failure of public respondent NLRC to resolve its cross-claim against Delta as the party ultimately liable for payment of the monetary award to the security guards.In its Resolution dated September 19, 2000, the NLRC dismissed the appeal, holding that it was not the proper forum to raise the issue. It went on to say that Jaguar, being the direct employer of the security guards, is the one principally liable to the employees. Thus, it directed petitioner to file a separate civil action for recovery of the amount before the regular court having jurisdiction over the subject matter, for the purpose of proving the liability of Delta.Jaguar sought reconsideration of the dismissal, but the Commission denied the same in its Resolution dated November 9, 2001.[3]Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the CA, which, in the herein assailed Decision dated October 21, 2002[4] and Resolution dated February 13, 2004,[5] dismissed the petition for lack of merit.In the present petition, the following error is set forth as a ground for the modification of the assailed Decision and Resolution:WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RESOLVING PETITIONER'S CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST PRIVATE RESPONDENT DELTA MILLING INDUSTRIES, INC.[6]Petitioner insists that its cross-claim should have been ruled upon in the labor case as the filing of a cross-claim is allowed under Section 3 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure which provides for the suppletory application of the Rules of Court. Petitioner argues that the claim arose out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action. Petitioner further argues that as principal, Delta Milling Industries, Inc. (Delta Milling) is liable for the awarded wage increases, pursuant to Wage Order Nos. NCR-04, NCR-05 and NCR-06; and in line with the ruling in Eagle Security Agency, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission,[7] petitioner should be reimbursed of any payments to be made.There is no question as regards the respective liabilities of petitioner and Delta Milling. Under Articles 106, 107 and 109 of the Labor Code, the joint and several liability of the contractor and the principal is mandated to assure compliance of the provisions therein including the statutory minimum wage. The contractor, petitioner in this case, is made liable by virtue of his status as direct employer. On the other hand, Delta Milling, as principal, is made the indirect employer of the contractor's employees for purposes of paying the employees their wages should the contractor be unable to pay them. This joint and several liability facilitates, if not guarantees, payment of the workers' performance of any work, task, job or project, thus giving the workers ample protection as mandated by the 1987 Constitution.[8]However, in the event that petitioner pays his obligation to the guard employees pursuant to the Decision of the Labor Arbiter, as affirmed by the NLRC and CA, petitioner has the right of reimbursement from Delta Milling under Article 1217 of the Civil Code, which provides:Art. 1217. Payment made by one of the solidary debtors extinguishes the obligation. If two or more solidary debtors offer to pay, the creditor may choose which offer to accept.He who made the payment may claim from his co-debtors only the share which corresponds to each, with the interest for the payment already made. If the payment is made before the debt is due, no interest for the intervening period may be demanded.x x x xThe question that now arises is whether petitioner may claim reimbursement from Delta Milling through a cross-claim filed with the labor court.This question has already been decisively resolved in Lapanday Agricultural Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals,[9] to wit:We resolve first the issue of jurisdiction. We agree with the respondent that the RTC has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the present case. It is well-settled in law and jurisprudence that where no employer-employee relationship exists between the parties and no issue is involved which may be resolved by reference to the Labor Code, other labor statutes or any collective bargaining agreement, it is the Regional Trial Court that has jurisdiction. In its complaint, private respondent is not seeking any relief under the Labor Code but seeks payment of a sum of money and damages on account of petitioner's alleged breach of its obligation under their Guard Service Contract. The action is within the realm of civil law hence jurisdiction over the case belongs to the regular courts. While the resolution of the issue involves the application of labor laws, reference to the labor code was only for the determination of the solidary liability of the petitioner to the respondent where no employer-employee relation exists. Article 217 of the Labor Code as amended vests upon the labor arbiters exclusive original jurisdiction only over the following:Unfair labor practices;Termination disputes;If accompanied with a claim for reinstatement, those cases that workers may file involving wages, rates of pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;Claims for actual, moral exemplary and other forms of damages arising from employer-employee relations;Cases arising from any violation of Article 264 of this Code, including questions involving legality of strikes and lockouts; andExcept claims for Employees Compensation, Social Security, Medicare and maternity benefits, all other claims, arising from employer-employee relations, including those of persons in domestic or household service, involving an amount exceeding five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for reinstatement.In all these cases, an employer-employee relationship is an indispensable jurisdictional requisite; and there is none in this case.[10] (Emphasis supplied)The jurisdiction of labor courts extends only to cases where an employer-employee relationship exists.In the present case, there exists no employer-employee relationship between petitioner and Delta Milling. In its cross-claim, petitioner is not seeking any relief under the Labor Code but merely reimbursement of the monetary benefits claims awarded and to be paid to the guard employees. There is no labor dispute involved in the cross-claim against Delta Milling. Rather, the cross-claim involves a civil dispute between petitioner and Delta Milling. Petitioner's cross-claim is within the realm of civil law, and jurisdiction over it belongs to the regular courts.Moreover, the liability of Delta Milling to reimburse petitioner will only arise if and when petitioner actually pays its employees the adjudged liabilities.[11] Payment, which means not only the delivery of money but also the performance, in any other manner, of the obligation, is the operative fact which will entitle either of the solidary debtors to seek reimbursement for the share which corresponds to each of the debtors.[12] In this case, it appears that petitioner has yet to pay the guard employees. As stated in Lapanday:However, it is not disputed that the private respondent has not actually paid the security guards the wage increases granted under the Wage Orders in question. Neither is it alleged that there is an extant claim for such wage adjustments from the security guards concerned, whose services have already been terminated by the contractor. Accordingly, private respondent has no cause of action against petitioner to recover the wage increases. Needless to stress, the increases in wages are intended for the benefit of the laborers and the contractor may not assert a claim against the principal for salary wage adjustments that it has not actually paid. Otherwise, as correctly put by the respondent, the contractor would be unduly enriching itself by recovering wage increases, for its own benefit.[13]Consequently, the CA did not commit any error in dismissing the petition and in affirming the NLRC Resolutions dated September 19, 2000 and November 9, 2001.WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.Double costs against petitioner.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Chico-Nazario, Nachura, and Reyes, JJ., concur.

(\"Delta\").\n\nPrivate respondents Rodolfo Sales, Melvin Tamayo, Dionisio Caranyagan, Jesus Silva, Jr., Jaime Moron and Daneth Fetalvero were hired as security guards by Jaguar. They were assigned at the premises of Delta in Libis, Quezon City. Caranyagan and Tamayo were terminated by Jaguar on May 26, 1998 and August 21, 1998, respectively. Allegedly their dismissals were arbitrary and illegal. Sales, Moron, Fetalvero and Silva remained with Jaguar. All the guard-employees, claim for monetary benefits such as underpayment, overtime pay, rest day and holiday premium pay, underpaid 13 th month pay, night shift differential, five days service and incentive leave pay. In addition to these money claims, Caranyagan and Tamayo argue that they were entitled to separation pay and back wages, for the time they were illegally dismissed until finality of the decision. Furthermore, all respondents claim for moral and exemplary damages.\n\nOn September 18, 1998, respondent security guards instituted the instant labor case before the labor arbiter.\n\nx x x x\n\nOn May 25, 1999, the labor arbiter rendered a decision in favor of private respondents Sales, et al., the dispositive portion of which provides:\n\"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the charges of illegal dismissal on the part of the complainants MELVIN R. TAMAYO and DIONISIO C. CARANYAGAN for lack of merit but ordering respondents JAGUAR SECURITY AND INVESTIGATION AGENCY and DELTA MILLING INDUSTRIES, INC., to jointly and severally pay all the six complainants, namely: RODOLFO A. SALES, MELVIN R. TAMAYO, JAIME MORON and DANETH FETALVERO the following money claims for their services rendered from April 24, 1995 to April 24, 1998:\n\na) wage differentials\nb) overtime pay differentials (4 hours a day)\nc) rest day pay\nd) holiday pay\ne) holiday premium pay\nf) 13 th month pay differentials\ng) five days service incentive leave pay per year subject to the exception earlier cited.\n\nThe Research and Information Unit of this Commission is hereby directed to compute and quantify the above awards and submit a report thereon within 15 days from receipt of this decision.\n\nFor purposes of any appeal, the appeal bond is tentatively set at P100,000.00.\n\nAll other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.\"\nOn July 1, 1999, petitioner Jaguar filed a partial appeal questioning the failure of public respondent NLRC to resolve its cross-claim against Delta as the party ultimately liable for payment of the monetary award to the security guards.\n\nIn its Resolution dated September 19, 2000, the NLRC dismissed the appeal, holding that it was not the proper forum to raise the issue. It went on to say that Jaguar, being the direct employer of the security guards, is the one principally liable to the employees. Thus, it directed petitioner to file a separate civil action for recovery of the amount before the regular court having jurisdiction over the subject matter, for the purpose of proving the liability of Delta.\n\nJaguar sought reconsideration of the dismissal, but the Commission denied the same in its Resolution dated November 9, 2001. [3]\nPetitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the CA, which, in the herein assailed Decision dated October 21, 2002 [4] and Resolution dated February 13, 2004, [5] dismissed the petition for lack of merit.\n\nIn the present petition, the following error is set forth as a ground for the modification of the assailed Decision and Resolution:\nWITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RESOLVING PETITIONER'S CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST PRIVATE RESPONDENT DELTA MILLING INDUSTRIES, INC. [6]\nPetitioner insists that its cross-claim should have been ruled upon in the labor case as the filing of a cross-claim is allowed under Section 3 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure which provides for the suppletory application of the Rules of Court. Petitioner argues that the claim arose out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action. Petitioner further argues that as principal, Delta Milling Industries, Inc. (Delta Milling) is liable for the awarded wage increases, pursuant to Wage Order Nos. NCR-04, NCR-05 and NCR-06; and in line with the ruling in Eagle Security Agency, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission , [7] petitioner should be reimbursed of any payments to be made.\n\nThere is no question as regards the respective liabilities of petitioner and Delta Milling. Under Articles 106, 107 and 109 of the Labor Code, the joint and several liability of the contractor and the principal is mandated to assure compliance of the provisions therein including the statutory minimum wage. The contractor, petitioner in this case, is made liable by virtue of his status as direct employer. On the other hand, Delta Milling, as principal, is made the indirect employer of the contractor's employees for purposes of paying the employees their wages should the contractor be unable to pay them. This joint and several liability facilitates, if not guarantees, payment of the workers' performance of any work, task, job or project, thus giving the workers ample protection as mandated by the 1987 Constitution. [8]\n\nHowever, in the event that petitioner pays his obligation to the guard employees pursuant to the Decision of the Labor Arbiter, as affirmed by the NLRC and CA, petitioner has the right of reimbursement from Delta Milling under Article 1217 of the Civil Code, which provides:\nArt. 1217. Payment made by one of the solidary debtors extinguishes the obligation. If two or more solidary debtors offer to pay, the creditor may choose which offer to accept.\n\nHe who made the payment may claim from his co-debtors only the share which corresponds to each, with the interest for the payment already made. If the payment is made before the debt is due, no interest for the intervening period may be demanded.\n\nx x x x\nThe question that now arises is whether petitioner may claim reimbursement from Delta Milling through a cross-claim filed with the labor court.\n\nThis question has already been decisively resolved in Lapanday Agricultural Development Corporation v.

HGL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND HON. ANTONIO BANTOLO, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 13, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, 6TH JUDICIAL REGION, CULASI, ANTIQUE, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nBefore us is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Decision [1] dated January 31, 2005, of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CEB SP No. 00035 which affirmed the Resolution [2] dated September 16, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\nPetitioner Semirara Mining Corporation is a grantee by the Department of Energy (DOE) of a Coal Operating Contract under Presidential Decree No. 972 [3] over the entire Island of Semirara, Antique, which contains an area of 5,500 hectares more or less. [4]\n\nPrivate respondent HGL Development Corporation is a grantee of Forest Land Grazing Lease Agreement (FLGLA) No. 184 by the then Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, [5] over 367 hectares of land located at the barrios of Bobog and Pontod, Semirara, Caluya, Antique. The FLGLA No. 184 was issued on September 28, 1984 [6] for a term of 25 years, to end on December 31, 2009. Since its grant, HGL has been grazing cattle on the subject property.\n\nSometime in 1999, petitioner's representatives approached HGL and requested for permission to allow petitioner's trucks and other equipment to pass through the property covered by the FLGLA. HGL granted the request on condition that petitioner's use would not violate the FLGLA in any way. Subsequently, however, petitioner erected several buildings for petitioner's administrative offices and employees' residences without HGL's permission. Petitioner also conducted blasting and excavation; constructed an access road to petitioner's minesite in the Panaan Coal Reserve, Semirara; and maintained a stockyard for the coal it extracted from its mines. Thus, the land which had been used for cattle grazing was greatly damaged, causing the decimation of HGL's cattle.\n\nOn September 22, 1999, HGL wrote petitioner demanding full disclosure of petitioner's activities on the subject land as well as prohibiting petitioner from constructing any improvements without HGL's permission. Petitioner ignored the demand and continued with its activities.\n\nOn December 6, 2000, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) unilaterally cancelled FLGLA No. 184 and ordered HGL to vacate the premises. The DENR found that HGL failed to pay the annual rental and surcharges from 1986 to 1999 and to submit the required Grazing Reports from 1985 to 1999 or pay the corresponding penalty for non-submission thereof. [7]\n\nHGL contested the findings and filed a letter of reconsideration on January 12, 2001, which was denied by DENR Secretary Heherson Alvarez in a letter-order dated December 9, 2002. The DENR stated that it had coordinated with the DOE, which had jurisdiction over coal or coal deposits and coal-bearing lands, and was informed that coal deposits were very likely to exist in Sitios Bobog and Pontod. Hence, unless it could be proved that coal deposits were not present, HGL's request had to be denied. [8]\n\nHGL sent a letter dated March 6, 2003 to DENR Secretary Alvarez seeking reconsideration. The DENR did not act on the letter and HGL later withdrew this second letter of reconsideration in its letter of August 4, 2003.\n\nOn November 17, 2003, HGL filed a complaint against the DENR for specific performance and damages with prayer for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 20675 (2003) with the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City. A writ of preliminary injunction was issued by the Caloocan City RTC on December 22, 2003, enjoining the DENR from enforcing its December 6, 2000 Order of Cancellation.\n\nMeanwhile, HGL had also filed on November 17, 2003, a complaint against petitioner for Recovery of Possession and Damages with Prayer for TRO and/or Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. C-146 with the Regional Trial Court of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13. [9]\n\nOn December 1, 2003, the Antique trial court heard the application for Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction in Civil Case No. C-146. Only HGL presented its evidence. Reception for petitioner's evidence was set to March 23-24, 2004. Petitioner was notified. But, on March 19, 2004, petitioner's President wrote the court asking for postponement since its counsel had suddenly resigned. The trial court refused to take cognizance of the letter and treated it as a mere scrap of paper since it failed to comply with the requisites for the filing of motions and since it was not shown that petitioner's President was authorized to represent petitioner. Because of petitioner's failure to attend the two scheduled hearings, the trial court, in an Order dated March 24, 2004, deemed the application for issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction submitted for decision. Meanwhile, petitioner had filed its Answer dated February 26, 2004, raising among others the affirmative defense that HGL no longer had any right to possess the subject property since its FLGLA has already been cancelled and said cancellation had already become final.\n\nOn April 14, 2004, petitioner filed a verified Omnibus Motion praying that the trial court reconsider its Order of March 24, 2004, since petitioner's failure to attend the hearing was due to an accident. Petitioner also prayed that the trial court admit as part of petitioner's evidence in opposition to the application for injunction, certified copies of the DENR Order of Cancellation dated December 6, 2000; HGL's letter of reconsideration dated January 12, 2001; letter of DENR Secretary Alvarez dated December 9, 2002 denying reconsideration of the order; and registry return receipt showing HGL's receipt of the denial of reconsideration. In the alternative, petitioner prayed that the case be set for preliminary hearing on its affirmative defense of lack of cause of action and forum-shopping. [10] Public respondent denied the Omnibus Motion in a Resolution dated June 21, 2004.\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the said resolution. Upon HGL's opposition, the motion was declared submitted for resolution in accordance with the trial court's Order of August 5, 2004. [11]\n\nOn September 16, 2004, the trial court granted the prayer for issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction. [12] Petitioner did not move for reconsideration of the order. The Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction was accordingly issued by the trial court on October 6, 2004. [13] The writ restrained petitioner or its agents from encroaching on the subject land or conducting any activities in it, and commanded petitioner to restore possession of the subject land to HGL or its agents.\n\nPetitioner questioned the Resolution dated September 16, 2004, and the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction dated October 6, 2004 before the Court of Appeals in a petition for certiorari, raising eight issues. On January 31, 2005, however, the appellate court dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals in its decision by Justice Magpale ruled on the issues posed before the appellate court:\nPRIVATE RESPONDENT HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT OR CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER THE PRINCIPAL ACTION OR COMPLAINT, MUCH LESS, TO THE ANCILLARY REMEDY OF INJUNCTION;\n\nPRIVATE RESPONDENT DID NOT COME TO COURT WITH ''CLEAN HANDS\";\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE UNJUSTIFIABLY AND ARBITRARILY DEPRIVED PETITIONER OF ITS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS BY NOT GIVING IT AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT EVIDENCE IN OPPOSITION TO THE MANDATORY INJUNCTION;\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE IMMEDIATELY GRANTED THE APPLICATION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A WRIT OF MANDATORY INJUNCTION WITHOUT FIRST RESOLVING THE PENDING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DATED JULY 12, 2004 OF PETITIONER;\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE DID NOT CONSIDER OR ADMIT THE CERTIFIED TRUE COPIES OF THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE DENR CANCELLING PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S FLGLA AS EVIDENCE AGAINST THE MANDATORY INJUNCTION PRAYED FOR;\n\nRESPONDENT JUDGE SHOULD HAVE GRANTED PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING ON ITS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT UNDER ITS COMPLAINT HAS NO CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST PETITIONER; RESPONDENT JUDGE SHOULD HAVE DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT OUTRIGHT FOR VIOLATION OF THE RULES ON FORUM SHOPPING BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT;\n\nTHE MANDATORY INJUNCTION ISSUED IN THE INSTANT CASE IS VIOLATIVE OF THE PROVISIONS OF PRESIDENTIAL DECREE 605. [14]\nThe Court of Appeals in the assailed Decision dated January 31, 2005, opined and ruled as follows (which we quote verbatim):\nAnent the first issue, WE rule against the petitioner.\n\nPerusal of the allegations in the Complaint filed by the private respondent with the court a quo show that its cause of action is mainly anchored on the Forest Land Grazing Lease Agreement (\"FLGLA\") executed by and between said private respondent and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) which became effective on August 28, 1984 and to expire on December 31, 2009.\n\nUnder the said lease agreement, the private respondent was granted permission to use and possess the subject land comprising of 367-hectares located at the barrios of Bobog and Pontod, Semirara Island, Antique for cattle-grazing purposes.\n\nHowever, petitioner avers that the \"FLGLA\" on which private respondent's cause of action is based was already cancelled by the DENR by virtue of its Orders dated December 6, 2000 and December 9, 2002.\n\nWhile it is true that the DENR issued the said Orders cancelling the \"FLGLA\", the same is not yet FINAL since it is presently the subject of Civil Case No. 20675 pending in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the \"FLGLA\" is still subsisting.\n\nThe construction of numerous buildings and the blasting activities thereon by the petitioner undertaken without the consent of the private respondent blatantly violates the rights of the latter because it reduced the area being used for cattle-grazing pursuant to the \"FLGLA\".\n\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that the three (3) indispensable requisites of a cause of action, to wit: (a) the right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created; (b) an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not to violate such right; (c) an act or omission on the part of such defendant is violative of the right of plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of defendant to the plaintiff for which the latter may maintain an action for recovery of damages, are PRESENT.\n\nHence, having established that private respondent herein has a cause of action under the principal action in Civil Case No. C-146, necessarily it also has a cause of action under the ancillary remedy of injunction.\n\nAnent the third issue, WE rule against the petitioner.\n\nThis Court finds that the petitioner was not deprived of due process.\n\nIt appears from the records of the instant case that the petitioner was given two (2) settings for the reception of its evidence in support of its opposition to the prayer of herein private respondent for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. Unfortunately, on both occasions, petitioner did not present its evidence.\n\nPetitioner claims that its failure to attend the hearings for the reception of its evidence was excusable due to the sudden resignation of its lawyer and as such, nobody can attend the hearings of the case.\n\nWE are not persuaded.\n\nScrutiny of the pleadings submitted by both parties shows that petitioner's lawyer, Atty. Mary Catherine P. Hilario, affiliates herself with the law firm of BERNAS SAN JUAN & ASSOCIATE LAW OFFICES with address at 2 nd Floor, DMCI Plaza 2281 Pasong Tamo Extension, Makati City, by signing on and in behalf of the said law office. This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that law offices employ more than one (1) associate attorney aside from the name partners. As such, it can easily assign the instant case to its other lawyers who are more than capable to prepare the necessary \"motion for postponement\" or personally appear to the court a quo to explain the situation.\n\nEven assuming arguendo that Atty. Hilario is the only one who is knowledgeable of the facts of the case, still, petitioners cannot claim that there was violation of due process because the \"ESSENCE of due process is reasonable opportunity to be heard x x x. What the law proscribed is lack of opportunity to be heard.\" In the case at bar, petitioner was given two (2) settings to present its evidence but it opted not to.\n\nLastly, a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction demands urgent attention from the court and as such, delay/s is/are frowned upon due to the irreparable damage/s that can be sustained by the movant.\n\nAnent the fourth issue, WE rule against the petitioner.\n\nPetitioner claims that the court a quo gravely erred when it issued the writ of preliminary injunction without first resolving its Motion for Reconsideration dated July 12, 2004.\n\nWE rule that the public respondent cannot be faulted for not resolving the Motion for Reconsideration dated July 12, 2004 because the same partakes of the nature of a second motion for reconsideration of the Order dated March 24, 2004.\n\nRecords readily disclose that a prior motion for reconsideration was filed by the petitioner herein assailing the Order dated March 24, 2004. Although captioned as \"Omnibus Motion\" the same was really a motion for reconsideration. Said \"Omnibus Motion\" was resolved by the court a quo in its Order dated June 21, 2004.\n\nHence, the public respondent is no longer duty bound to resolve the subsequent, reiterative and second motion for reconsideration.\n\nAnent the fifth issue, WE rule against the petitioner.\n\nThe court a quo was correct in disregarding the documentary evidence submitted by the petitioner in support of its opposition to the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.\n\nThe documentary evidence submitted by the petitioner herein with the court a quo were merely attached to an \"Omnibus Motion\" and was not properly identified, marked and formally offered as evidence which is a blatant disregard and violation of the Rules on Evidence.\n\nConsidering the above discussions, this Court finds that the public respondent did not abuse his discretion in issuing the assailed resolution.\n\nAnent the eighth issue, WE likewise rule against the petitioner.\n\nPresidential Decree (PD) 605 is the law \"Banning the Issuance by Courts of Preliminary Injunctions in Cases Involving Concessions, Licenses, and Other Permits Issued by Public Administrative Officials or Bodies for the Exploitation of Natural Resources.\"\n\nSection 1 thereof provides that \"No court of the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order, preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction in any case involving or growing out of the issuance, suspension, revocation, approval or disapproval of any concession, license, permit, patent or public grant of any kind for the disposition, exploitation, utilization, exploration and development of the natural resources of the country.\"\n\nThe instant case is not within the purview of the above-cited law because the issue/s raised herein does not involve or arise out of petitioner's coal operation contract.\n\nThe case filed with the court a quo is principally based on the alleged encroachment by the petitioner of the subject land over which private respondent claims it has authority to occupy or possess until December 31, 2009 pursuant to FLGLA No. 184.\n\nAs such, the preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the court a quo did not in any way affect the efficacy of the petitioner's coal concession or license.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is DENIED and consequently, the assailed Resolution is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15]\nHence, this instant petition. On February 23, 2005, this Court issued a TRO enjoining the implementation and enforcement of the Court of Appeals Decision dated January 31, 2005. [16]\n\nPetitioner submits in the petition now the following grounds:\nI\n\nTHE RESOLUTION DATED 16 SEPTEMBER 2004 AND THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION DATED 6 OCTOBER 2004 ISSUED BY PUBLIC RESPONDENT ARE A PATENT NULLITY AS PRIVATE RESPONDENT CLEARLY HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT OR CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER ITS PRINCIPAL ACTION OR COMPLAINT, MUCH LESS, TO THE ANCILLARY REMEDY OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION;\n\nII\n\nA WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION CANNOT BE USED TO TAKE PROPERTY OUT OF THE POSSESSION OF ONE PARTY AND PLACE IT INTO THAT OF ANOTHER WHO HAS NO CLEAR LEGAL RIGHT THERETO;\n\nIII\n\nPRIVATE RESPONDENT'S COMPLAINT IN CIVIL CASE NO. C-146 IS IN THE NATURE OF AN ACCION PUBLICIANA , NOT FORCIBLE ENTRY; HENCE, A WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION IS NOT A PROPER REMEDY;\n\nIV\n\nPETITIONER WAS UNJUSTIFIABLY AND ARBITRARILY DEPRIVED OF ITS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS WHEN IT WAS DENIED THE RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE IN OPPOSITION TO THE APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION;\n\nV\n\nTHE PUBLIC RESPONDENT DELIBERATELY WITHHELD THE RESOLUTION OF PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DATED 12 JULY 2004 AND PROCEEDED TO PREMATURELY ISSUE THE PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION IN VIOLATION OF PETITIONER'S RIGHT TO FAIR PLAY AND JUSTICE;\n\nVI\n\nPUBLIC RESPONDENT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN:\n\n1) HE REFUSED OR FAILED TO ADMIT AND/OR CONSIDER THE CERTIFIED DENR RECORDS OF THE DENR ORDER CANCELLING PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S FLGLA;\n\n2) HE REFUSED OR FAILED TO CONDUCT A HEARING ON THESE CERTIFIED PUBLIC DOCUMENTS WHICH CONCLUSIVELY PROVE PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S LACK OF CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER THE PRINCIPAL ACTION; AND\n\n3) HE REFUSED OR FAILED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT OUTRIGHT FOR VIOLATING THE RULES ON FORUM SHOPPING BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT. [17]\nBefore this Court decides the substantive issues raised herein, certain procedural issues that were raised by the parties must first be addressed.\n\nPetitioner contends that it was improper for the Regional Trial Court of Antique to issue the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction (and for the Court of Appeals to affirm the same) without giving it an opportunity to present evidence and without first resolving the Motion for Reconsideration dated July 12, 2004. But as borne by the records of the case, it is evident that petitioner had the opportunity to present evidence in its favor during the hearing for the application of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction before the lower court. However, petitioner's failure to present its evidence was brought by its own failure to appear on the hearing dates scheduled by the trial court. Thus, petitioner cannot complain of denial of due process when it was its own doing that prevented it from presenting its evidence in opposition to the application for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. It must be pointed out that the trial court correctly refused to take cognizance of the letter of petitioner's President which prayed for the postponement of the scheduled hearings. Said letter was not a proper motion that must be filed before the lower court for the stated purpose by its counsel of record. Moreover, there was absolutely no proof given that the sender of the letter was the duly authorized representative of petitioner.\n\nSecond, the filing of the motion for reconsideration dated July 12, 2004, which essentially reproduced the arguments contained in the previously filed and denied Omnibus Motion dated April 14, 2004, renders the said motion for reconsideration dated July 12, 2004, a mere pro forma motion. Moreover, the motion for reconsideration dated June 12, 2004, being a second motion for reconsideration, the trial court correctly denied it for being a prohibited motion. [18]\n\nThird, it must be stated that the petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals should not have prospered because petitioner failed to file a motion for reconsideration from the assailed resolution of the Regional Trial Court of Antique, granting the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. Well settled is the rule that before a party may resort to the extraordinary writ of certiorari , it must be shown that there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Thus, it has been held by this Court that a motion for reconsideration is a condition sine qua non for the grant of the extraordinary writ of certiorari . [19] Here, a motion for reconsideration was an available plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, designed to give the trial court the opportunity to correct itself.\n\nNow on the merits of the instant petition.\n\nThe pivotal issue confronting this Court is whether the Court of Appeals seriously erred or committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the September 16, 2004 Resolution of the Regional Trial Court of Antique granting the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.\n\nUnder Article 539 of the New Civil Code, a lawful possessor is entitled to be respected in his possession and any disturbance of possession is a ground for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to restore the possession. [20] Thus, petitioner's claim that the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is improper because the instant case is allegedly one for accion publiciana deserves no consideration. This Court has already ruled in Torre, et al. v. Hon. J. Querubin, et al . [21] that prior to the promulgation of the New Civil Code, it was deemed improper to issue a writ of preliminary injunction where the party to be enjoined had already taken complete material possession of the property involved. However, with the enactment of Article 539, the plaintiff is now allowed to avail of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to restore him in his possession during the pendency of his action to recover possession. [22]\n\nIt is likewise established that a writ of mandatory injunction is granted upon a showing that (a) the invasion of the right is material and substantial; (b) the right of complainant is clear and unmistakable; and (c) there is an urgent and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage. [23]\n\nIn the instant case, it is clear that as holder of a pasture lease agreement under FLGLA No. 184, HGL has a clear and unmistakable right to the possession of the subject property. Recall that under the FLGLA, HGL has the right to the lawful possession of the subject property for a period of 25 years or until 2009. As lawful possessor, HGL is therefore entitled to protection of its possession of the subject property and any disturbance of its possession is a valid ground for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction in its favor. The right of HGL to the possession of the property is confirmed by petitioner itself when it sought permission from HGL to use the subject property in 1999. In contrast to HGL's clear legal right to use and possess the subject property, petitioner's possession was merely by tolerance of HGL and only because HGL permitted petitioner to use a portion of the subject property so that the latter could gain easier access to its mining area in the Panaan Coal Reserve.\n\nThe urgency and necessity for the issuance of a writ of mandatory injunction also cannot be denied, considering that HGL stands to suffer material and substantial injury as a result of petitioner's continuous intrusion into the subject property. Petitioner's continued occupation of the property not only results in the deprivation of HGL of the use and possession of the subject property but likewise affects HGL's business operations. It must be noted that petitioner occupied the property and prevented HGL from conducting its business way back in 1999 when HGL still had the right to the use and possession of the property for another 10 years or until 2009. At the very least, the failure of HGL to operate its cattle-grazing business is perceived as an inability by HGL to comply with the demands of its customers and sows doubts in HGL's capacity to continue doing business. This damage to HGL's business standing is irreparable injury because no fair and reasonable redress can be had by HGL insofar as the damage to its goodwill and business reputation is concerned.\n\nPetitioner posits that FLGLA No. 184 had already been cancelled by the DENR in its order dated December 6, 2000. But as rightly held by the Court of Appeals, the alleged cancellation of FLGLA No. 184 through a unilateral act of the DENR does not automatically render the FLGLA invalid since the unilateral cancellation is subject of a separate case which is still pending before the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City. Notably, said court has issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the DENR from enforcing its order of cancellation of FLGLA No. 184.\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that the construction of numerous buildings and blasting activities by petitioner were done without the consent of HGL, but in blatant violation of its rights as the lessee of the subject property. It was likewise found that these unauthorized activities effectively deprived HGL of its right to use the subject property for cattle-grazing pursuant to the FLGLA. It cannot be denied that the continuance of petitioner's possession during the pendency of the case for recovery of possession will not only be unfair but will undeniably work injustice to HGL. It would also cause continuing damage and material injury to HGL. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction in favor of HGL.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED . The Decision dated January 31, 2005, of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CEB SP No. 00035, which affirmed the Resolution dated September 16, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13, as well as the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction dated October 6, 2004 issued pursuant to said Resolution, is AFFIRMED .

(successor of movant respondent Philippine Banking Corporation) filed their memoranda on October 14, 2004 and October 29, 2004, respectively.\n\nOn December 7, 2004, the parties, through their respective counsels, filed a joint motion [4] before this Court for approval of an undated compromise agreement which was executed for the purpose of ending the longstanding litigation.\n\nThe Compromise Agreement [5] reads as follows:\nThis Agreement entered into this _____ (sic) day of ____ (sic), 2004 in Makati City by and between:\n\nThe National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia , a company engaged in banking, duly organized and existing under the laws of Saudi Arabia, with principal office at King Abdul Aziz Street, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, hereinafter referred to as NCB and represented herein by its Head, International Banking, MR.

Mustaza Bin Kassim\nUnder Article 1306 of the Civil Code, contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.\u00a0 Thus, a compromise agreement whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions to resolve their differences to thereby put an end to litigation is binding on the contracting parties and is expressly acknowledged as a juridical agreement between them. [6] To have the force of res judicata , however, the compromise agreement must be approved by final order of the court. [7]\n\nTo be valid, the compromise agreement must be based on real claims and actually agreed upon in good faith.

SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, LEON MARIA MAGSAYSAY AND ENGR. EMMANUEL LALIN, RESPONDENTS \nD E C I S I O N\nALFREDO SY FOR HIMSELF AND AS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT OF GONZALO SY, VERONICA SY, ROSARIO SY, MANUEL SY AND JOSE SEE, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, LEON MARIA MAGSAYSAY AND ENGR. EMMANUEL LALIN, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nThis petition for review [1] assails the May 17, 2004 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79877 which affirmed the July 26, 2002 Resolution [3] of the Secretary of Justice dismissing petitioners' complaint against respondents for grave coercion. Also assailed is the October 7, 2004 Resolution [4] denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\nThe [petitioners] aver that sometime in 1985, Dolores F. Posadas, through respondent, Leon Maria F. Magsaysay, as her attorney-in-fact, filed an ejectment case against them to recover a parcel of land in Paco, Manila consisting of approximately 8,295 sq.m. Several structures stand on the land including their post-war built building which has served as their family residence with a small sari-sari store. The trial court thereafter ruled in favor of Dolores F. Posadas. On appeal, the Regional Trial Court affirmed the trial court's decision. On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the latter court set aside the decision of the Regional Trial Court and dismissed the complaint.\n\nHowever, during the pendency of the appeal in the Court of Appeals, respondent Leon Maria F. Magsaysay obtained from the office of the Building Official of Manila a Notice of Condemnation dated February 8, 1996.\n\nIn response, the [petitioners] caused the assessment of the structural soundness of their residence. Consequently, on February 20, 1996, a Certificate of Structural Inspection was issued by a licensed engineer, certifying to the general integrity of the structure which merely needed minor repairs.\n\nIn October, 1997, the [petitioners] received a letter from the Office of the Building Official informing them that respondent Leon Maria F. Magsaysay had requested for the condemnation of certain structures, including the structure owned by [petitioners]. The [petitioners] were directed to submit their Answer/Comment and supporting papers.\n\nA scheduled ocular inspection of the property was deferred at the instance of [petitioners'] counsel. Subsequently, an order of demolition dated February 3, 1998 was issued by Manila Building Official Hermogenes B. Garcia, on the basis of a Resolution dated February 3, 1998 issued by a committee created to act on the letter dated October 13, 1997 of respondent Leon Maria Guerrero.\n\nThe [petitioners] filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the order with the Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The complainants also obtained a TRO enjoining the enforcement of the order of demolition.\n\nIn the morning of August 28, 1998, respondent Emmanuel T. Lalin, together with several men with hammers, ropes, axes and crowbars, arrived at the complainants' residence and over their protests, demolished the building which served as their family residence and sari-sari store. The [petitioners] contend that the respondents' act of demolishing their building without any legal authority to do so is an act of grave coercion, punishable under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nOn the other hand, respondent Leon Ma. Magsaysay, in his counter affidavit, avers that he is one of the co-owners of the land located at the corner of Pedro Gil and A. Isip Sts., Paco, Manila as evidenced by TCT Nos. 216323 and 216327. He further avers that the demolition of the [petitioners'] structure was based on the lawful order of the City Building Official of Manila and affirmed by the DPWH.\n\nRespondent Civil Engineer Emmanuel T. La[l]in, for his part, also avers that the demolition was undertaken pursuant to a duly-issued demolition order and that he was only hired by respondent Leon Maria Magsaysay to implement the same . [5] The City Prosecutor of Manila dismissed the complaint for grave coercion for lack of merit. Hence, petitioners appealed to the Secretary of Justice but same was denied, finding that the demolition was carried out pursuant to a duly issued demolition order.\n\nPetitioners filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals which denied the petition for lack of merit.\n\nPetitioners' motion for reconsideration was likewise denied hence this petition for review based on the following grounds: [6]\n\nI\nTHE FINDINGS OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ARE MERE CONCLUSIONS THAT ARE PATENTLY CONTRARY TO THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.\n\nII\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS MANIFESTLY OVERLOOKED CERTAIN RELEVANT AND UNDISPUTED FACTS THAT, IF PROPERLY CONSIDERED, WOULD JUSTIFY A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION.\n\nIII\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE WITHOUT DELVING INTO THE RECORDS OF THE CASE, THUS WITHOUT FACTUAL AND LEGAL BASIS. Petitioners alleged that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause for the filing of an information for grave coercion against respondents and that the Secretary of Justice gravely abused his discretion in holding otherwise.\n\nRespondents argued that the determination of probable cause during preliminary investigation is an executive function, the correctness of which is a matter that the courts may not be compelled to pass upon. At any rate, they claim that the Secretary of Justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that the complaint for grave coercion is without merit.\n\nThe issue for resolution is whether there is probable cause for the filing of an information against respondents Magsaysay and Lalin for the offense of grave coercion.\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nProbable cause, for purposes of filing a criminal information, has been defined as such facts as are sufficient to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that respondent is probably guilty thereof. [7] In Villanueva v. Secretary of Justice , [8] we held:\nIt is such a state of facts in the mind of the prosecutor as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe or entertain an honest or strong suspicion that a thing is so. The term does not mean \"actual or positive cause;\" nor does it import absolute certainty. It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. Thus, a finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction. It is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged. Precisely, there is a trial for the reception of evidence of the prosecution in support of the charge. In the instant case, we find that the acts complained of are sufficient to sustain a finding of probable cause. The elements of grave coercion under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code are as follows: 1) that a person is prevented by another from doing something not prohibited by law, or compelled to do something against his will, be it right or wrong; 2) that the prevention or compulsion is effected by violence, threats or intimidation; and 3) that the person who restrains the will and liberty of another has no right to do so, or in other words, that the restraint is not made under authority of law or in the exercise of any lawful right. [9]\n\nIt is undisputed that on August 28, 1998, respondents, together with several men armed with hammers, ropes, axes, crowbars and other tools arrived at the petitioners' residence and ordered them to vacate the building because they were going to demolish it. [10] Petitioners tried to stop respondents from proceeding with the demolition but their pleas went unheeded. Intimidated by respondents and their demolition team, petitioners were prevented from peacefully occupying their residence and were compelled to leave against their will. Thus, respondents succeeded in implementing the demolition while petitioners watched helplessly as their building was torn down. From the facts alleged in the complaint, as well as the evidence presented in support thereof, there is prima facie showing that respondents did not act under authority of law or in the exercise of any lawful right.\n\nRespondent Magsaysay claimed that the demolition was carried out by the Office of the Building Official, which is tasked to implement the National Building Code. [11] We note, however, that respondent Lalin admitted in his Counter-Affidavit that he was hired by Magsaysay to implement the Demolition Order. [12] The building officials made manifestations before the trial court in Civil Case No. 98-87513 that they were not aware of the demolition and that respondent Lalin is not connected with their office. They also denied conspiring with respondent Magsaysay in effecting the demolition.\n\nLikewise, the Office of the Building Official issued an Order [13] dated August 28, 1998 directing respondent Magsaysay to desist from proceeding with the demolition. On the same date, it also issued a Notice [14] advising respondent Lalin to stop the demolition for failing to comply with the 5-day prior notice requirement and considering that the demolition was being effected within the 15-day reglementary period for appeal. In another Order dated September 10, 1998, [15] the Office of the Building Official declared that the demolition was hastily done and in contravention of the terms and conditions of the Demolition Order. [16]\n\nIndeed, while respondents claim to have acted under authority of law in compelling petitioners to vacate the subject property and effecting the demolition, the documentary evidence show otherwise. From the records, it is clear that a prima facie case for grave coercion exists and that there is sufficient ground to sustain a finding of probable cause which needs only to rest on evidence showing that, more likely than not, a crime has been committed and that it was committed by the accused. [17] Nevertheless, respondents may disprove petitioners' charges but such matters may only be determined in a full-blown trial on the merits where the presence or absence of the elements of the crime may be thoroughly passed upon. [18]\n\nWhile it is this Court's general policy not to interfere in the conduct of preliminary investigations, leaving the investigating officers sufficient discretion to determine probable cause, courts are nevertheless empowered to substitute their judgment for that of the Secretary of Justice when the same was rendered without or in excess of authority. [19]\n\nIn the instant case, the dismissal of the complaint despite sufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause clearly constitutes grave error, thus warranting a reversal.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition is GRANTED. The May 17, 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79877 affirming the July 26, 2002 Resolution of the Secretary of Justice; and its October 7, 2004 Resolution denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration, are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE .

      "title": "denying such Petition. The arguments raised therein by herein respondents are: (1) the petitioner was dismissed for just cause and it was done with due compliance to the requirements of due process, hence, the dismissal was legal; and (2) since the dismissal was legal, respondents cannot be held liable for the petitioner's alleged unpaid salary, termination pay, as well as claims for damages. Nonetheless, this Court's Third Division agrees in the findings of the Court of Appeals that, indeed, herein petitioner has been illegally dismissed. Furthermore, it also ruled on the amount of backwages and separation/termination pay that should be awarded to herein petitioner, to wit:As correctly ruled by the appellate court, [petitioner] Williams is entitled only to an amount corresponding to his unpaid earned salary in the amount of P50,000.00 and separation/termination pay in the fixed amount of P100,000.00 pursuant to the parties' contract of employment.[15]From the aforesaid Resolution, respondents and petitioner separately filed their Motions for Reconsideration but both motions were denied with finality by the Third Division in a Resolution dated 20 April 2005.[16]In view of the Resolutions dated 14 February 2005 and 20 April 2005, issued by the Third Division of this Court in G.R. No. 166178, the issue presented by the petitioner in the present case has already been resolved. Considering that the Motions for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 14 February 2005 filed by both parties had been denied with finality, thus, the said Resolution becomes final and executory and, therefore, also binding on this Division. The principle of res judicata is applicable herein.Res judicata literally means, \"a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment.\" Res judicata lays the rule that an existing final judgment or decree rendered on the merits, and without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon any matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all other actions or suits in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction on the points and matters in issue in the first suit.[17]The elements of res judicata are: (1) there is a final judgment or order; (2) the court rendering it has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the judgment or order is on the merits; and (4) there is between the two cases identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action.[18]This Court holds that the Resolution of this Court's Third Division dated 14 February 2005 in G.R. No. 166178 is a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. Moreover, the parties involve in the two cases, to wit: G.R. No. 166177, which is the case under consideration, and G.R. No. 166178 are identical, and this can be gleaned from the title of these two cases, i.e., the former is Herbert Williams v. Days Hotel Philippines, Inc., Omnisource Management, Inc., and Reynaldo Concepcion, while the latter is Days Hotel Philippines, Inc., Omnisource Management, Inc., and Reynaldo Concepcion v. Herbert Williams. There is no doubt that the above-mentioned cases involve exactly the same parties in the same capacity as employers and employee. Hence, the requisite of identity of parties is clearly established.The two cases likewise involve the same subject matter and causes of action as they arise from the same set of facts, which is the dismissal from employment of herein petitioner that has been declared illegal by the Labor Arbiter and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, as well as the modification of the awards of backwages and monetary claims to herein petitioner by the Court of Appeals. Thus, the said Resolution dated 14 February 2005, rendered by this Court's Third Division is a bar to the continuation of the present Petition filed before Us. Additionally, on 29 June 2005, herein petitioner already filed a Motion for Execution[19] of the Resolution of this Court's Third Division, dated 14 February 2005, praying for the issuance of a writ of execution for the enforcement of the said Resolution in his favor. He stated in the aforesaid Motion for Execution that:6. The respondent's (sic) [P]etition for [R]eview on [C]ertiorari filed with the Supreme Court has been dismissed with the denial of respondent's (sic) [M]otion for [R]econsideration in a [R]esolution dated 20 April 2005. x x x.7. The [D]ecision of the Court of Appeals affirming the [Labor] Arbiter's [D]ecision with modification has become final and executory;[20]In so doing, this Court regards such act of the petitioner as an express relinquishment of his right to proceed with this Petition. Thus, petitioner is already estopped from pursuing his claim that the awards granted in his favor by the Labor Arbiter be affirmed in full. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby DENIED. Following the Resolution of this Court's Third Division, dated 14 February 2005, in G.R. No. 166178, the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 31 August 2004 and 23 November 2004, respectively, are hereby AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.* Retired as of 7 December 2006.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Ruben T.

National Labor Relations Commission (2nd Division), and Days Hotel Philippines Inc., Omnisource Management Inc., and Reynaldo Concepcion and its Resolution, [2] dated 23 November 2004, which annulled the Decision and Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), dated 26 March 2002 [3] and 30 May 2002, [4] respectively, thereby reinstating with modification the Labor Arbiter's Decision, [5] dated 1 June 2001 as to the amount of backwages awarded to herein petitioner.\n\nThe antecedent facts of the case are as follows:\n\nHerein petitioner Herbert Williams is an Indian national and an experienced hotelier with 25 years of extensive working knowledge of hotel and restaurant management in senior positions. He was enticed by private respondent Reynaldo Concepcion (Concepcion) into joining Days Hotel Philippines Inc., as Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer (EVP-COO). He worked as such from 24 May 1999 up to the time of his dismissal on 21 September 1999.\n\nHerein respondents are Days Hotel Philippines, Inc. (Days Hotel), a domestic corporation engaged in hotel business; Omnisource Management, Inc. (Omnisource), likewise a domestic corporation, which operates the chain of hotels of respondent Days Hotel; and Concepcion, the chairperson of the board of directors of both corporations.\n\nPetitioner was summoned to the office of respondent Concepcion on 7 September 1999, and allegedly verbally dismissed by the latter in the presence of Lettie Delarmente (Delarmente), respondent corporations' Vice-President for Human Resources, and Matthew Reeves, Sales and Marketing Manager, for having purportedly uttered derogatory remarks against the person of respondent Concepcion. Petitioner claimed that respondent Concepcion screamed at him and told him to \"get out,\" \"you're fired,\" \"I don't need you anymore,\" and afterwards slammed the door. [6]\n\nOn 8 September 1999, petitioner received a letter [7] from Delarmente asking, on behalf of the Board of Directors of respondent Days Hotel, for an explanation within 48 hours why he should not be given disciplinary action. Said letter also informed him of his preventive suspension. Petitioner sent a reply to the said letter on 10 September 1999.\n\nOn 17 September 1999, a notice [8] of termination of employment on the ground of loss of trust and confidence was issued to petitioner. Petitioner's termination of employment was made effective on 21 September 1999.\n\nConsequently, on 11 November 1999, petitioner lodged with the Labor Arbiter a Complaint for Illegal Dismissal and Non-Payment of Benefits with Claim for Moral and Exemplary Damages and Attorney's Fee against herein respondents.\n\nAs a defense against the Complaint filed by petitioner, respondents asserted that the dismissal of the petitioner was due to a valid cause, i.e., loss of trust and confidence. They contended that contrary to company policy, petitioner meddled in the negotiation process with a prospective client, a function that lies exclusively with respondent Concepcion as Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; that petitioner even uttered unpleasant comments against respondent Concepcion; and that during petitioner's stint with Days Hotel, he was not able to contribute any significant improvement to the operation of their hotels.\n\nOn 1 June 2001, Labor Arbiter Isabel G. Panganiban-Ortiguerra rendered a Decision in favor of herein petitioner. The decretal portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring respondent Days Hotel Inc., Omnisource Management Inc., and Reynaldo A. Concepcion guilty of illegal dismissal, and they are hereby ordered as follows:\nTo pay [petitioner] backwages reckoned from his dismissal up to the date of this [D]ecision in the amount of P2,033,000.00; To pay [petitioner] separation pay in an amount equivalent to one half month pay for every year of service reckoned from the time he was employed up to the time he will actually be paid his separation pay in accordance with the doctrine of imputed service, which as of this date is in the amount of P100,000.00; To pay money claims of [petitioner] in the amount of P751,286.00; To pay moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P500,000.00; and To pay [petitioner] attorney's fee in an amount equivalent to 10% of whatever he may receive by virtue of this [D]ecision. [9] Respondents appealed the Labor Arbiter's Decision to the NLRC. On 26 March 2002, the NLRC reversed the aforesaid Decision and sustained the dismissal of petitioner. The dispositive portion thereof reads as follows:\nWHEREFORE, all the foregoing duly considered, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered DISMISSING the [C]omplaint for lack of merit. [10]\nThe NLRC ratiocinated:\nTo begin with, there has been no denial emanating from the [petitioner] as to the utterances made by him to third persons concerning the management style, i.e. work habits or decision making processes of [respondent] Mr. Reynaldo Concepcion. All that is heard from him is that his statements were without malice and taken out of context.\n\nx x x x\n\nThus, with the bare answer of the [petitioner] to the charges, there was no need to secure and present the affidavits of either [respondent] Mr. Concepcion or Mr. Matthew Reeves, the latter being the person whom the [petitioner] dissuaded from joining the companies headed by [respondent] Mr. Concepcion.\nx x x x\n\nx x x. We can conceive of no justifiable reason why the [petitioner] should utter the remarks attributed to him to [sic] Ms. Cristy Bollos, President of Maria Plaza Suites and with whom the respondents were negotiating. By his actuation, [petitioner] has recklessly placed in disrepute the character and person of [respondent] Mr. Reynaldo Concepcion. x x x. By making known to other persons his misgivings about his immediate superior, [petitioner] has acted in a manner contrary to and inimical to the best interests of the hotel. Hence, it is Our view that the respondents were justified in discontinuing the services of the [petitioner]. [11]\nOn 10 May 2002, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the afore-quoted Decision. On 30 May 2002, the NLRC issued a Resolution denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nPetitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on 18 October 2002. On 31 August 2004, the appellate court rendered a Decision reinstating the Labor Arbiter's Decision declaring that petitioner has been illegally dismissed but modifying the same by limiting the award of backwages to P50,000.00, and separation/termination pay to a fixed amount of P100,000.00. The decretal portion of said Decision states that:\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED . The assailed Decision and Resolution of the NLRC are ANNULED . The Labor Arbiter's Decision is hereby REINSTATED with MODIFICATION as follows: (a). The award of backwages in the amount of P2,033,000.00 is DELETED and in lieu thereof, petitioner should be paid his unpaid salary in the amount of P50,000.00;\n\n(b). The separation/termination pay payable to petitioner shall be in the fixed amount of P100,000.000 pursuant to the employment contract;\n\n(c). The monetary value of petitioner's vacation, sick and rest/recreation leave benefits embedded in his money claims is DELETED.\n\nAll other orders of the Labor Arbiter stand. [12] On 22 September 2004, petitioner filed a partial Motion for Reconsideration of the aforesaid Decision. Respondents also filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the said Decision. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals denied both Motions in its Resolution, dated 23 November 2004.\n\nHence, this Petition.\n\nPetitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in not giving him, in full, the claims awarded to him as stated in the Decision of the Labor Arbiter. Citing the case of Gelmart Industries (Phils.), Inc., v. Leogardo, [13] petitioner asserts that in determining the facts of the case and its merits and demerits, it is the Labor Arbiter who has the discretion to determine which party deserves credence on the basis of the evidence received. He further contends that the Court of Appeals discloses no justifiable reason, either based upon facts, or legal points, to reduce the awards granted by the Labor Arbiter. He avers that the Court of Appeals only justifies such reduction of award by the phrase \"stipulations constitute the law of the contract,\" not taking into consideration that the subject matter of the case is an employment contract, which, by operation of law is deemed to include all labor provisions which are advantageous to the employee.\n\nHowever, on 14 February 2005, this Court's Third Division, acting on the separate Petition for Review filed by herein respondents docketed, as G.R. No. 166178, entitled, Days Hotel Philippines, Inc., Omnisource Management, Inc., and Reynaldo Concepcion v. Herbert Williams, had rendered a Resolution [14] denying such Petition. The arguments raised therein by herein respondents are: (1) the petitioner was dismissed for just cause and it was done with due compliance to the requirements of due process, hence, the dismissal was legal; and (2) since the dismissal was legal, respondents cannot be held liable for the petitioner's alleged unpaid salary, termination pay, as well as claims for damages. Nonetheless, this Court's Third Division agrees in the findings of the Court of Appeals that, indeed, herein petitioner has been illegally dismissed. Furthermore, it also ruled on the amount of backwages and separation/termination pay that should be awarded to herein petitioner, to wit:\nAs correctly ruled by the appellate court, [petitioner] Williams is entitled only to an amount corresponding to his unpaid earned salary in the amount of P50,000.00 and separation/termination pay in the fixed amount of P100,000.00 pursuant to the parties' contract of employment. [15] From the aforesaid Resolution, respondents and petitioner separately filed their Motions for Reconsideration but both motions were denied with finality by the Third Division in a Resolution dated 20 April 2005. [16]\n\nIn view of the Resolutions dated 14 February 2005 and 20 April 2005, issued by the Third Division of this Court in G.R. No. 166178, the issue presented by the petitioner in the present case has already been resolved. Considering that the Motions for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 14 February 2005 filed by both parties had been denied with finality, thus, the said Resolution becomes final and executory and, therefore, also binding on this Division. The principle of res judicata is applicable herein.\n\nRes judicata literally means, \"a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment.\" Res judicata lays the rule that an existing final judgment or decree rendered on the merits, and without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon any matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all other actions or suits in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction on the points and matters in issue in the first suit. [17]\n\nThe elements of res judicata are: (1) there is a final judgment or order; (2) the court rendering it has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the judgment or order is on the merits; and (4) there is between the two cases identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action. [18]\n\nThis Court holds that the Resolution of this Court's Third Division dated 14 February 2005 in G.R. No. 166178 is a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. Moreover, the parties involve in the two cases, to wit: G.R. No. 166177, which is the case under consideration, and G.R. No. 166178 are identical, and this can be gleaned from the title of these two cases, i.e., the former is Herbert Williams v. Days Hotel Philippines, Inc., Omnisource Management, Inc., and Reynaldo Concepcion, while the latter is Days Hotel Philippines, Inc., Omnisource Management, Inc., and Reynaldo Concepcion v. Herbert Williams . There is no doubt that the above-mentioned cases involve exactly the same parties in the same capacity as employers and employee. Hence, the requisite of identity of parties is clearly established.\n\nThe two cases likewise involve the same subject matter and causes of action as they arise from the same set of facts, which is the dismissal from employment of herein petitioner that has been declared illegal by the Labor Arbiter and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, as well as the modification of the awards of backwages and monetary claims to herein petitioner by the Court of Appeals. Thus, the said Resolution dated 14 February 2005, rendered by this Court's Third Division is a bar to the continuation of the present Petition filed before Us.\n\nAdditionally, on 29 June 2005, herein petitioner already filed a Motion for Execution [19] of the Resolution of this Court's Third Division, dated 14 February 2005, praying for the issuance of a writ of execution for the enforcement of the said Resolution in his favor. He stated in the aforesaid Motion for Execution that:\n6. The respondent's (sic) [P]etition for [R]eview on [C]ertiorari filed with the Supreme Court has been dismissed with the denial of respondent's (sic) [M]otion for [R]econsideration in a [R]esolution dated 20 April 2005. x x x.\n\n7. The [D]ecision of the Court of Appeals affirming the [Labor] Arbiter's [D]ecision with modification has become final and executory; [20] In so doing, this Court regards such act of the petitioner as an express relinquishment of his right to proceed with this Petition. Thus, petitioner is already estopped from pursuing his claim that the awards granted in his favor by the Labor Arbiter be affirmed in full.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby DENIED . Following the Resolution of this Court's Third Division, dated 14 February 2005, in G.R. No. 166178, the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 31 August 2004 and 23 November 2004, respectively, are hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.\n\n* Retired as of 7 December 2006.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Ruben T.

NO. 164575, December 06, 2006 ]\n\nROBERT P. WA-ACON, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nROBERT P. WA-ACON, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nVELASCO, JR., J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari , under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeks the reversal of the April 22, 2004 Decision [1] of the Sandiganbayan convicting petitioner Robert P. Wa-acon of Malversation under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code for misappropriating PhP 92,199.20, which forms part of his accountabilities as Special Collecting Officer of the National Food Authority (NFA); and the July 23, 2004 Resolution [2] of said graft court denying Wa-acon's plea for reconsideration in Criminal Case No. 14375.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe information against the accused Wa-acon reads as follows:\nThat on about the period from July 19, 1979 to September 28, 1981, in the City of Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Robert P. Wa-acon, a public officer, being a Special Collecting Officer, National Food Authority (NFA) and stationed at Canonigo, Paco, Manila and as such was accountable and responsible of rice stocks and empty sacks for which he received and entrusted to him, by reason of his official position, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with grave abuse of confidence, misappropriate, misapply, embezzle and convert to his own personal use and benefit the aforesaid stocks of rice and empty sacks with a total aggregate money value of P114,303.00, to the damage and prejudice of the government in the aforementioned amount.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [3]\nThe facts of the case as found by the Sandiganbayan are:\nOn the period from July 19, 1979 to September 28, 1981, accused Robert P. Wa-acon was a Special Collecting Officer of the National Food Authority (NFA) and was assigned at the Kadiwa Center at Moriones, Tondo, Manila. One of his duties was to receive grains, consisting of rice and mongo, which shall then be sold to the public on retail. The proceeds of the sale of the grains shall then be collected by the same accused.\n\nOn September 28, 1981, by virtue of a Travel Order, a team of Auditors from the Commission of Audit, composed of Dionisio A. Nillo, as team leader, Mercedes Punzalan, Audit Examiner II, Herminia Gonzales, Audit Examiner II and Raquel Cruz, Clerk II, as members, conducted an examination of the accountabilities of various Special Collecting Officers of the NFA, one of whom was accused Robert P. Wa-acon. The said examination was conducted at the Office of the Regional Auditor, NFA Metro Manila Office at Paco, Manila. In that office, the audit team asked the presence of accused Robert P. Wa-acon by virtue of a demand letter dated September 1981, demanding the latter to produce cash, cash items, stocks and empty sacks and other pertinent papers. As testified by Prosecution witness Dionisio A. Nillo, accused Robert P. Wa-acon told the audit team that \"he has no cash on hand at the time pertaining to his accountability as Special Collecting Officer. Hence, it was indicated in the Cash Count Sheet that there was no cash counted during the cash examination.\n\nBased on the examination conducted on the various Warehouse Stock Issues, Empty Sacks Receipts, Official Receipts submitted and the Certificate of Inventory of Stocks and Empty Sacks dated September 18, 1981, containing the signature of accused Robert P. Wa-acon and witnessed by Virgilio Cacanendin, Special Investigator, Manolito Diaz, Bookkeeper, Louie Pastofide, Proceso A. Saavedra, Audit Examiner II and Gloria T. Reyes, Audit Examiner I, the audit team rendered a Report of Examination, Form 74-A of the Cash and Accounts of accused Robert P. Wa-acon. All of the aforementioned documents were submitted by Proceso Saavedra, a resident Audit Examiner of the NFA Metro Manila Office, Paco, Manila, to the Audit team headed by Dionisio A. Nillo. In connection with the Audit conducted, the Audit Team prepared the following Schedules: Schedule 1: Statement of Rice received by Robert A. Wa-acon, Schedule 1-A: Statement of Rice/mongo Received by Robert P. Wa-acon, Schedules 2: Statement of Remittances of Proceeds from Sales of Robert P. Wa-acon, Schedule 3: Statement of Refunds made by Robert P. Wa-acon, Schedule I: Statement of Empty Sacks Returned by Robert P. Wa-acon, and Summary of Empty Sacks Accountability of Robert P. Wa-acon and the Revised Summary of Cash Examination of Robert P. Wa-acon.\n\nThe Report of the Examination of the Cash and Accountabilities of accused Robert P. Wa-acon shows that the latter incurred a cash shortage of One Hundred Fourteen Thousand Three Hundred Three Pesos (P114,303.00). In the Revised Summary of the Cash Examination of accused Robert P. Wa-acon, the cash shortage was changed to One Hundred Two Thousand and One Hundred Ninety Nine Pesos and Twenty Centavos (P102,199.20) after deducting the cost of sixty (60) bags of regular milled rice value of Six Thousand Nine Hundred (P6,900.00) and the monetary value of the empty sacks returned by accused Robert P. Wa-acon, which is Five Thousand Two Hundred Three Pesos and Eighty Centavos (P5,203.80). However, accused Robert P. Wa-acon made a refund of the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00). Therefore, the total shortage amount[ed] to Ninety Two Thousand One Hundred Ninety Nine Pesos and Twenty Centavos (P92,199.20) . [4]\nDuring the trial before the Sandiganbayan, petitioner denied that he misapplied and converted for his personal use the stocks of rice and empty sacks as he had been faithfully remitting all the proceeds of the rice he sold to consumers. [5]\n\nPetitioner also contended that the shortage discovered by the Audit Team may be attributed to the discrepancy in the actual weight of the rice actually delivered to him and that of the weight reflected in the receipts. In other words, he claimed that the rice delivered to him weighed less than that for which he signed. He alleged that he discovered the shortage of five (5) to ten (10) kilos per sack only upon delivery of the rice to the station/outlet. Petitioner explained that he could not check the weight of the sacks delivered to him as the weighing scale in their office had a maximum capacity of only twelve (12) kilograms. Petitioner claimed that he informed his superiors of such shortage verbally, but was unheeded. [6]\n\nPetitioner further claimed that the only reason he signed for the sacks of rice, despite the shortage, was because he was told that he would not be paid his salary if he would not sign, added to the fact that he was then hungry\u2013all of which prompted Wa-acon to sign the audit report of the Audit Team. [7] As to the missing empty sacks, petitioner argued that those were in the custody of the delivery man who had a logbook where Special Collecting Officers sign as proof that the delivery man had taken the sacks. [8]\n\nThe Sandiganbayan Ruling\n\nCiting the presumption under the last paragraph of Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code that \"the failure of the public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds which he is chargeable upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use\" and the inability of accused Wa-acon to \"rebut the presumption that he had put the rice stocks and the empty sacks to personal use,\" the Sandiganbayan found him guilty of malversation of public funds under the Revised Penal Code. In the graft court's April 22, 2004 Decision, the dispositive portion reads:\nWHEREFORE , judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Robert P. Wa-acon, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds as defined in and penalized by Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code and, there being no modifying circumstance, is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of reclusion temporal minimum, as the minimum to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of reclusion temporal maximum, as the maximum and to suffer perpetual special disqualification. The accused Robert P. Wa-acon is likewise ordered to pay a FINE equal to the amount of the funds malversed, which is Ninety Two Thousand One Hundred Ninety Nine Pesos and Twenty Centavos (P 92,199.20) and to indemnify the National Food Authority (NFA) the amount of Ninety Two Thousand One Hundred Ninety Nine Pesos and Twenty Centavos (P92,199.20) with interest thereon.\n\nSO ORDERED. [9]\nCorrespondingly, petitioner filed his May 20, 2004 Motion for Reconsideration [10] of the Decision, reiterating his defenses raised during the trial.\n\nOn July 23, 2004, the Sandiganbayan issued the assailed Resolution denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that accused Wa-acon raised no new substantial issues and cogent reasons to justify the reversal of the April 22, 2004 Decision.\n\nThus, Wa-acon filed the instant petition.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nPetitioner Wa-acon presented a lone issue to be resolved: his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt; thus, the assailed Decision and Resolution convicting him of malversation must be reversed.\n\nIn seeking the recall of his conviction, accused petitioner asserts that the unremitted amounts for the rice stocks and the money allegedly gained from the empty sacks were not used for his personal use and therefore, the fourth element of malversation\u2013that the accused appropriated, took, or misappropriated public funds or property for which he was accountable\u2013was not proven. According to petitioner, while he might have violated certain auditing rules and regulations, this violation is not tantamount to malversation. He leans on the rulings in Madarang v. Sandiganbayan , [11] and Agullo v. Sandiganbayan [12] that \"it is essential to prove that there had been a conversion of public fund to personal use\" and that \"conversion must be affirmatively proved\"; otherwise, the presumption is \"deemed never to have existed at all.\"\n\nArticle 217 of the Revised Penal Code whereas provides:\nMalversation of public funds or property . \u2013 Presumption of malversation . \u2013 Any public officer who, by reason of the duties of his office, is accountable for public funds or property, shall appropriate the same, or shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, or through abandonment or negligence, shall permit any other person to take such public funds or property, wholly or partially, or shall otherwise be guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of such funds or property x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nThe failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal uses (emphasis supplied).\nThe elements to constitute malversation under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code are as follows:\nThe elements common to all acts of malversation \u2013 under Article 217 are: (a) that the offender be a public officer; (b) that he had custody or control of funds or property by reason of the duties of his office; (c) these funds were public funds or property for which he was accountable; and (d) that he appropriated, took, misappropriated or consented or through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take them. [13]\nAccused petitioner has conceded that the first three (3) elements of the crime of malversation exist but asseverates that the fourth element\u2013that he appropriated, took, or misappropriated the public funds for which he was made accountable by the Commission on Audit (COA) to his own personal use\u2014was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nUnfortunately, petitioner's postulation has no legal mooring. Article 217, as amended by Republic Act 1060, no longer requires proof by the State that the accused actually appropriated, took, or misappropriated public funds or property. Instead, a presumption, though disputable and rebuttable, was installed that upon demand by any duly authorized officer, the failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property\u2013with which said officer is accountable\u2013should be prima facie evidence that he had put such missing funds or properties to personal use. When these circumstances are present, a \"presumption of law\" arises that there was malversation of public funds or properties as decreed by Article 217. A \"presumption of law\" is sanctioned by a statute prescribing that \"a certain inference must be made whenever facts appear which furnish the basis of the interference.\" This is to be set apart from a \"presumption of fact\" which is a \"[conclusion] drawn from particular circumstances, the connection between them and the sought for fact having received such a sanction in experience as to have become recognized as justifying the assumption.\" [14] When there is a presumption of law, the onus probandi (burden of proof), generally imposed upon the State, is now shifted to the party against whom the interference is made to adduce satisfactory evidence to rebut the presumption and hence, to demolish the prima facie case.\n\nAfter the government auditors discovered the shortage and demanded an explanation, petitioner Wa-acon was not able to make money readily available, [15] immediately refund the shortage, [16] or explain satisfactorily the cash deficit . [17] These facts or circumstances constitute prima facie evidence that he converted such funds to his personal use.\n\nPrima facie evidence is defined as:\nEvidence good and sufficient on its face. Such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is sufficient to establish a given fact, or the group or chain of facts constituting the party's claim or defense, and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient. Evidence which, if unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to sustain a judgment in favor of the issue it supports, but which may be contradicted by other evidence (emphasis supplied). [18]\nNeither can accused petitioner claim that such presumption under Article 217 violates the constitutional guarantee of presumption of innocence for \"the establishment of a prima facie case does not take away the presumption of innocence which may x x x be such as to rebut and control it.\" [19] Such prima facie evidence, if unexplained or uncontradicted, \"can counterbalance the presumption of innocence to warrant a conviction.\" [20]\n\nSince the facts adduced by the State brought about a prima facie evidence which is considered sufficient to sustain petitioner's conviction under Article 217, it is incumbent upon petitioner Wa-acon to destroy the presumption of law.\n\nIn his quest to exculpate himself from the legal assumption of criminal liability for the missing funds, he insisted that: 1) the sacks of rice were less than that declared in the receipts when they were delivered to him; 2) he sold the rice at the older and lower prices, as he was not informed of changes in the prices of the rice; and 3) the empty sacks of rice were in the possession of the delivery men. However, petitioner merely settled for his bare uncorroborated testimony during the trial before the Sandiganbayan. He never bothered to adduce other pieces of evidence to fortify his defenses. Petitioner did not produce the delivery men whom he claims had in their possession the empty sacks or any acknowledgement receipt for said bags. Moreover, petitioner did not bring forward his co-workers to attest to and confirm the practice of, and substantiate petitioner's story of receiving sacks of rice without weighing them and that the bags received weighed less than that reflected in the receipt. The established rule is that \"[d]enials, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are deemed negative and self-serving evidence unworthy of credence.\" [21] The court a quo is correct in holding that as compared to credible witnesses like the COA auditors who testified on affirmative matters, the self-serving negative testimony of accused petitioner Wa-acon has no substantial weight or credit. [22]\n\n\"Negative testimony\" is made clear as\ntestimony that a fact did not exist, that a thing was not done, that no one did not hear\u2014is admissible and, in the absence of opposing testimony, is usually regarded as of sufficient probative force to sustain a verdict. It is however, a long recognized general rule of evidence that all other things being equal, positive evidence is stronger than negative evidence. [23]\nSince Wa-acon lamentably fell short of adducing the desired quantum of evidence, his weak and unconvincing testimony standing alone did not overthrow the presumption that he misappropriated public funds.\n\nAs a last ditch effort to exonerate himself, petitioner anchored his defense on Madarang [24] and Agullo , [25] where public employees charged of malversation were cleared of criminal liability.\n\nIn these two (2) cases cited by petitioner, we elucidated the legal presumption of assumed criminal liability for accountable funds under the last paragraph of Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code. In Madarang , we explained:\nConcededly, the first three elements are present in the case at bar. Lacking any evidence, however, of shortage, or taking, appropriation, or conversion by petitioner or loss of public funds, there is no malversation ( Narciso vs. Sandiganbayan , 229 SCRA 229 [1994]). True, the law creates a presumption that the mere failure of an accountable officer to produce public funds which have come into his hand on demand by an officer duly authorized to examine his accounts is prima facie evidence of conversion. The presumption is, of course, rebuttable. Accordingly, if petitioner is able to present adequate evidence that can nullify any likelihood that he had put the funds or property to personal use, then that presumption would be at an end and the prima facie case is effectively negated. [26]\nIn Agullo, we amplified that:\nThus, in a string of categorical pronouncements, this Court has consistently and emphatically ruled that the presumption of conversion incarnated in Article 217, paragraph (4) of the Revised Penal Code is \u2014 by its very nature \u2013 rebuttable. To put it differently, the presumption under the law is not conclusive but disputable by satisfactory evidence to the effect that the accused did not utilize the public funds or property for his personal use, gain or benefit.\n\nAccordingly, if the accused is able to present adequate evidence that can nullify any likelihood that he had put the funds or property to personal use, then that presumption would be at an end and the prima facie case is effectively negated. This Court has repeatedly said that when the absence of funds is not due to the personal use thereof by the accused, the presumption is completely destroyed; in fact, the presumption is never deemed to have existed at all. [27]\nUnfortunately, petitioner's vaunted reliance on Madarang and Agullo does not provide legal relief as the facts in these cases are not on all fours with his case. The accused parties in said cases were able to produce satisfactory evidence ample enough to prove that the missing funds were not converted to their personal uses and thus, the legal presumption was effectively negated.\n\nIn Madarang, the accused, based on the COA audit report, was charged with malversation of PhP 20,700.00 representing advance rental payments for the lease of real property owned by the City of Cebu for which he was responsible as a barangay captain. When the accused was asked to account for such missing funds, he introduced convincing evidence that the funds were utilized by the barangay for its projects and for the benefit of his constituents, namely: for materials for the water system of the barangay hall, barangay police uniforms, and payment for medicine. Therefore, the legal presumption was successfully overturned.\n\nLikewise, in Agullo , the accused, who was the disbursing officer of then Ministry of Public Works and Highways, Regional Office No. VIII, Candahug, Palo, Leyte, was charged based on audit, with malversation of PhP 26,404.26 representing the salaries of the personnel in her office. The accused admitted that the funds were lost; however, she was able to prove that she suffered a stroke while going to her office. This was corroborated by the barangay captain of the place where she suffered a stroke, as well as medical certificates to prove the illness. She was acquitted because the loss of funds was not due to malversation.\n\nIn contrast, petitioner anchored his defenses solely on his own bare testimony unsubstantiated by other parol, documentary, or object evidence to prop up such self-serving allegations. Without doubt, the rulings in Madarang and Agullo cannot be considered precedents to the case at bar because the facts in said cases are not the same or substantially similar to petitioner Wa-acon's situation.\n\nWithout any strong and convincing proof to bring down the disputable presumption of law, the Court is left with no other option but to sustain petitioner's conviction.\n\nWHEREFORE, We DENY the petition and the assailed April 22, 2004 Decision and the July 23, 2004 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 14375 are AFFIRMED IN TOTO.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio-Morales, and Tinga, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Diosdado M.

Dacay\nHowever, respondents failed to pay the loans which matured on February 14, 2001. Thus, petitioner sought to foreclose the mortgages extrajudicially.\n\nOn February 28, 2001, respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 56, Mandaue City, a Complaint [4] for Declaratory Relief, Injunction, Damages, Annulment of Promissory Notes, Documents, and Contracts against petitioner, docketed as Civil Case No. MAN-4045. The complaint alleges that prior to 1998, respondents obtained credit accommodations from petitioner. The latter required respondents' representatives to sign \"standard pre-printed bank forms in fine print, such as Credit Line Agreements (CLA), Promissory Notes (PN), Real Estate Mortgages (REM), Chattel Mortgages (CM), Trust Receipts (TR), Surety Agreements (JSS) and other bank forms and documents.\" Respondents complied since they trusted petitioner. However, it tuned out that petitioner's employees filled the blanks with \"false and inaccurate entries.\" Respondents deny and dispute the genuineness and due execution of the documents and pray for the following reliefs:\nImmediately upon filing, to issue ex parte a 72-hour temporary restraining order and thereafter upon summary hearing, to issue a temporary restraining order for a maximum period of twenty (20) days restraining and enjoining defendants, their agents, representatives or any other persons acting on their behalf from doing or proceeding with the following:\n\na) proceeding with the auction sale of the properties under the REMs,\nb) execution of Certificate of Sale;\nc) registering Certificate of Sale with the Registry of Deeds;\nd) execution of the Deed of Final Sale and other consolidation documents;\ne) publication of Notices of Sale;\nf) posting of Notices of Sale;\ng) using the questioned documents, like the TRs, to seek administrative, civil, or criminal remedies;\nh) disturbing the status quo prior to the litigation.\n\nAfter due notice and hearing, a Preliminary Injunction be issued upon posting of a bond enjoining defendant, its employees, agents, representatives, or any other persons acting on its behalf from doing the above acts complained against;\n\nAfter trial, it is prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of plaintiffs and\nagainst defendant as follows: a) Declaring null and void the CLA, REMs, CMs, PNs, JSS, TRs, and other related documents, the notices of sale, the entire foreclosure proceedings, including the auction sale, the amount claimed by the bank to be the outstanding account, the amount claimed by the bank to be the principal, the interest unilaterally imposed by the bank, the penalties imposed by the bank and the PNs made basis for default and foreclosure;\n\nb) Declaring the CLA, REMs, CMs, PNs, JSS, TRs, and other related documents as without consideration, invalid, inoperative, ineffective, unenforceable, null and void and to cancel the same;\n\nc) To make the injunction permanent;\n\nd) To order the bank to comply with its commitments, assurances and representations to help in the rehabilitation of the Dacay Group and the restructuring of its obligations, if any;\n\ne) To award to plaintiffs moral damages of P300,000.00, exemplary damages of P200,000.00, attorney's fees of P200,000.00 plus P1,000.00 per billable hour, and litigation expenses of P300,000.00;\n\nf) Declaring that the defendant cannot validly do, perform or suffer to be done the acts complained of.\n\nOn March 9, 2001, the trial court issued an Order [5] granting respondents' prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), thus:\n\nIn resolving the petition for the issuance of a TRO the court, without going into the merits of the case has taken into consideration:\na) the fact that petitioners/plaintiffs are presently in the process of rehabilitating their business concerns and for which purpose, a consortium of banks/creditors has been put into existence and that Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) even had initially approved and led such effort as indicated by the participation of one of its Senior Vice Presidents Ricardo G. Lazatin;\n\nb) the admission by respondent/defendant, in open court, that it has already initiated foreclosure proceedings against petitioners/plaintiffs and that it has in fact scheduled on March 30, 2001 the auction sale of petitioners' properties subject matter of the foreclosure proceedings, as well as the consequent damage resultant thereto;\n\nc) the purpose of a temporary restraining order (TRO) which is merely to suspend proceedings until there may be an opportunity to inquire whether any injunction should be granted. In resolving the petition for the issuance of a TRO the court, without going into the merits of the case has taken into consideration:\n\na) the fact that petitioners/plaintiffs are presently in the process of rehabilitating their business concerns and for which purpose, a consortium of banks/creditors has been put into existence and that Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) even had initially approved and led such effort as indicated by the participation of one of its Senior Vice Presidents Ricardo G. Lazatin;\n\nb) the admission by respondent/defendant, in open court, that it has already initiated foreclosure proceedings against petitioners/plaintiffs and that it has in fact scheduled on March 30, 2001 the auction sale of petitioners' properties subject matter of the foreclosure proceedings, as well as the consequent damage resultant thereto;\n\nc) the purpose of a temporary restraining order (TRO) which is merely to suspend proceedings until there may be an opportunity to inquire whether any injunction should be granted.\nWHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered and in the interest of substantial justice, the defendant is hereby ordered to cease and desist and/or its agents, representatives or any other person acting in its behalf to immediately stop foreclosure proceedings of plaintiffs' properties subject matter of the said foreclosure proceedings, including but not being limited to publication for foreclosure and subsequent auction sale of the said properties.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPetitioner filed its Answer with Affirmative Defenses, Counterclaim, and Vigorous Opposition to the Order directing the issuance of a TRO and/or preliminary mandatory injunction. Likewise, petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss Based On Affirmative Defenses alleging that: (1) the venue is improperly laid; (2) the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case for non-payment of proper docket fees; (3) there is non-joinder of indispensable parties; and (4) the trial court has no jurisdiction to enjoin the foreclosure proceedings.\n\nOn March 27, 2001, the trial court issued an Order [6] denying petitioner's motion to dismiss, thus:\n\nThis resolves defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n\nDefendant in his motion insists that the case should be dismissed on the following affirmative defenses: (a) venue is improperly laid; (b) lack of jurisdiction considering the non-payment of docketing fees; (c) non-joinder of indispensable parties and (d) lack of jurisdiction or authority to enjoin foreclosure proceedings.\nVENUE\n\nRecords show that the office address of plaintiffs is in Mandaue City. In fact, defendant's annexes to its answer (Annex \"I\" and \"L\") admit that plaintiffs' business address and principal place of business are at Pakna-an, Mandaue City. Likewise similarly situated are the properties sought to be foreclosed. Apparently, foregoing considered, venue has been properly laid.\n\nJURISDICTION\n\nIt is to be noted that the question of jurisdiction has not been raised by defendant except with the cause of action regarding annulment of mortgages on defendant's insistence that the tax declaration attached is not the latest. Considering however that annulment of mortgage is incapable of pecuniary estimation the court feels that jurisdiction is proper.\n\nWhat determines the nature of an action and the court which has jurisdiction over it are the allegations made by the plaintiff. Sandel v. Court of Appeals , 262 SCRA 101,\n\nA court's jurisdiction cannot be made to depend upon defenses set up in the answer or in a motion to dismiss but upon the allegations of the complaint. Sandel v. Court of Appeals, 262 SCRA 101,\n\nINDISPENSABLE PARTY\n\nEvidence has not been introduced, to the satisfaction of the court that indeed Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) no longer exists and BPI has taken over its assets and liabilities. Besides, the commercial linkage was between FEBTC and Shemberg as records show.\n\nAUTHORITY\n\nIt is an inherent power of the court concomitant to its very existence to issue provisional remedies, like injunction, to protect the rights and interest of parties pending litigation.\n\nPremises considered, the court feels and finds no basis to grant defendant's motion. Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss is, as it is hereby, DENIED.\n\nSO ORDERED. Likewise on the same day, March 27, 2001, the trial court issued another Order [7] directing the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in favor of respondents, thus:\n\nWHEREFORE, let a writ of injunction issue enjoining defendant, its employees, agents or representatives, and all those who may be acting in their behalf, from:\n\n(1) Taking further actions to foreclose the real estate and chattel mortgage collaterals of plaintiffs;\n\n(2) To maintain the status quo during the pendency of the proceedings and to refrain from performing the acts complained of including but not being limited to the publication and notice of sale, conducting any foreclosure auction sale and other similar acts which will violate the status quo.\n\nThe Clerk of Court is hereby directed to issue the writ prayed for.\n\nPlaintiffs are ordered to put a bond of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00)\n\nSO ORDERED.\nPetitioner then filed with the trial court the following: (a) Motion to Resolve the Motion to Dismiss; (b) Motion to Dissolve Preliminary Mandatory Injunction; (c) Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Dated March 27, 2001; and (d) Opposition to the Sufficiency of Bond.\n\nOn August 16, 2001, the trial court issued the following Order: [8]\n\nFor consideration by the court are the defendant's (1) Motion for Reconsideration of the Denial of the Motion to Dismiss and (2) the Motion for Reconsideration of the Grant of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction.\n\nAfter a careful and exhaustive consideration of the arguments adduced in Movant's Motion for Reconsideration of the Denial of its Motion to Dismiss, the court finds that the arguments advanced for consideration had already been treated and passed upon by this court.\n\nThe same finding also holds true with respect to defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of the Grant of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction.\n\nAccordingly, both motions are hereby DENIED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPetitioner then filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 67270, contending that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the following: (1) Order dated March 9, 2001 granting respondents' prayer for a TRO; (2) Order dated March 27, 2001 ordering the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction; (3) Order also dated March 27, 2001 denying its motion to dismiss; and (4) Order dated August 16, 2001 denying its motion for reconsideration of the Order denying its motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration of the Order granting respondents' application for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 16, 2004, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision dismissing the petition for certiorari.\n\nThe appellate court held that as the trial court has jurisdiction over the case, its orders or decisions upon all questions therein, cannot be corrected by the extraordinary writ of certiorari.\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution of May 28, 2004.\n\nHence, the instant petition raising the following issues: (a) whether the trial court has jurisdiction over Civil Case No. MAN-4045; and (b) whether petitioner bank is entitled to the writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.\n\nOn the first issue , petitioner contends that in real actions, the assessed value of the property or if there is none, the estimated value thereof, must be alleged in the complaint, and shall serve as the basis for computing the fees. Nowhere in the complaint in Civil Case No. MAN-4045 did respondents allege the assessed values of their realties. Hence, there is no adequate basis for computing the proper filing fees. It necessarily follows that the fees paid are deficient. The trial court, therefore, did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.\n\nRespondents counter that a perusal of the complaint in Civil Case No. MAN-4045 shows that the suit primarily involves cancellation of mortgages, an action incapable of pecuniary estimation. Consequently, petitioner's contention that there is a deficiency in the payment of docket fees is without merit.\n\nA court acquires jurisdiction over a case only upon the payment of the prescribed fees. [9] The importance of filing fees cannot be gainsaid for these are intended to take care of court expenses in the handling of cases in terms of costs of supplies, use of equipment, salaries and fringe benefits of personnel, and others, computed as to man-hours used in the handling of each case. [10] Hence, the non-payment or insufficient payment of docket fees can entail tremendous losses to the government in general and to the judiciary in particular.\n\nIs an action for cancellation of mortgage incapable of pecuniary estimation?\n\nUnder Section 19 (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 180, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691, Regional Trial Courts have sole, exclusive, and original jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide \"all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation.\"\n\nIn Singsong v. Isabela Sawmill , [11] this Court laid the test for determining whether the subject matter of an action is incapable of pecuniary estimation, thus: Ascertain the nature of the principal action or remedy sought. If the action is primarily for recovery of a sum of money, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary estimation. Whether the trial court has jurisdiction would depend upon the amount of the claim. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, where the money claim is only incidental or a consequence of the principal relief sought, the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation.\n\nHere, the primary reliefs prayed for by respondents in Civil Case No. MAN-4045 is the cancellation of the real estate and chattel mortgages for want of consideration. In Bumayog v. Tumas, [12] this Court ruled that where the issue involves the validity of a mortgage, the action is one incapable of pecuniary estimation. In the more recent case of Russell v. Vestil, [13] this Court, citing Bumayog , [14] held that an action questioning the validity of a mortgage is one incapable of pecuniary estimation. Petitioner has not shown adequate reasons for this Court to revisit Bumayog and Russell . Hence, petitioner's contention can not be sustained. Since respondents paid the docket fees, as computed by the clerk of court, consequently, the trial court acquired jurisdiction over Civil Case No. MAN-4045.\n\nConcerning to the second issue , it should be noted that CA-G.R. SP No. 67270 is a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus alleging that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the following Orders: (1) Order dated March 9, 2001 granting respondents' prayer for a TRO; (2) Order dated March 27, 2001, directing the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction; (3) Order also dated March 27, 2001 denying petitioner's motion to dismiss; and (4) Order dated August 16, 2001 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration of the grant of preliminary injunction.\n\nThis Court holds that the Court of Appeals did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing the questioned Orders.\n\nThere is grave abuse of discretion where the acts complained of amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reasons of passion or personal hostility. [15] It is such whimsical and capricious exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that the trial court acted in fair, reasonable, and expeditious manner, thus:\nThus, on the 6th of March 2001, His Honor held a hearing on the application for temporary restraining order. He conducted at least three trial-type hearings on the 19th, 20th, and 23rd of March 2001, complete with direct examination, cross-examination, re-direct examination, re-cross examination and marking and offer of exhibits vis-\u00e1-vis the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Four witnesses testified during the hearings \u2013 two for the Dacay Group and two for the bank. Both parties were even required to submit memoranda.\nIndeed, the records are bereft of any indication that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the challenged Orders. Verily, the Court of Appeals correctly held that certiorari will not lie, the sole office of the writ being to correct grave abuse of discretion. Where a court has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the action, as in the instant case, its decisions on all questions arising from the case are but exercises of such jurisdiction. [16] If its findings are not correct, these would at best be questions of law, not abuse of discretion correctible by the extraordinary remedy of certiorari. [17]\n\nWHEREFORE, this Court DENIES the petition. The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 67270\nare AFFIRMED .

MONTANO, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nAtty. Carmelito A. Montano stands charged with gross misconduct relative to his filing of Civil Case No. C-19928 entitled Spouses Tomas See Tuazon and Natividad See Deecho v. John Siy Lim and the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City . [1]\n\nIt appears that complainant John Siy Lim was the defendant in Civil Case No. C-14542 for reformation of contract, quieting of title, with damages, then pending before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City, Branch 131. [2] The subject of the dispute was a 650-square meter conjugal lot along A. del Mundo Street, 7 th Avenue, Caloocan City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 860. After trial, the RTC ruled in favor of defendant (complainant herein), and declared that the deed of sale the parties executed on July 15, 1987 was an absolute and unconditional conveyance of subject property by the plaintiff in favor of such defendant. On motion for reconsideration, however, the trial court reversed itself and declared that the sale was in fact an equitable mortgage. It thus ordered the cancellation of TCT No. 152621 and the reinstatement of the previous title on the subject property.\n\nThe complainant appealed the case to the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 40167. In its Decision dated March 31, 1995, the appellate court reversed the ruling of the RTC, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, the appealed Order dated November 16, 1992, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the original Decision of the trial court, dated December 2, 1991, hereby REINSTATED, with the modification that plaintiff-appellee is ordered to pay defendant-appellant the sum of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos a month as reasonable rental for the use and occupation of Apartment No. 161 from July 15, 1988 until the premises shall have been vacated and possession thereof peacefully turned over to defendant-appellant.\n\nThe counterclaim for attorney's fees of defendant-appellant is DENIED. There is no clear showing that the action taken by plaintiff-appellee was done in bad faith. There should be no penalty on the right to litigate. [3]\nThe aggrieved party elevated the matter to this Court, and the petition was docketed as G.R. No. 119794. On October 3, 2000, the Court affirmed the ruling of the CA and denied the petition. [4] Entry of judgment was made of record on October 3, 2000 . [5]\n\nOn January 4, 2002, respondent filed a Notice of Appearance [6] as counsel of Tomas See Tuazon (the losing party) in the RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 131 in Civil Case No. C-14542. On January 7, 2002, he filed, in behalf of his client, a \"Motion to Comply to [ sic ] Decision without Writ,\" [7] worded as follows:\nPlaintiff is aware that pursuant to the decision of the court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, the decision on the present case had already become final and executory.\n\nIn order to avoid undue inconvenience on the part of herein defendant, plaintiff shall voluntarily settle the money judgment as stated in the decision sought to be enforced.\n\nThe plaintiff will be filing Eight Hundred Ten Thousand (P810,000.00) Pesos , equivalent to 162 months of rent as per decision and the same to be covered by supersedeas bond issued by a reliable insurance company to answer for said obligation.\n\nEvery month starting February 15, 2002, plaintiff shall deposit to the court the amount of P5,000.00 as monthly rent. [8]\nOn the same date, respondent, in behalf of his clients (the spouses Tomas See Tuazon) filed the Complaint [9] for nullity of TCT and other documents, reconveyance, maintenance of physical possession before the RTC of Caloocan City, eventually raffled to Branch 121 thereof (Civil Case No. C-19928) .\n\nMeantime, on February 19, 2002, Judge Luisito C. Sardillo of Branch 126 [10] issued an Order [11] in Civil Case No. C-14542 granting the Motion for Execution with Manifestation earlier filed by the prevailing party (complainant herein), and denying for lack of merit, the \"Motion to Comply to [ sic ] Decision without Writ\" filed by respondent counsel.\n\nThis prompted the complainant to file the instant complaint for disbarment against respondent. In his Complaint-Affidavit [12] dated March 20, 2002, complainant alleged that respondent filed the complaint in Civil Case No. C-19928 out of malice, pointing out that it involves \"the same parties, the same causes of action and relief prayed for as that of Civil Case No. C-14542.\" Thus, the complainant prayed that the respondent be \"disbarred and/or suspended from the practice of law for his gross misconduct,\" on the following allegation:\nEvidently, I have been subjected to harassment by the antics of the respondent in filing a recycled case docketed as Civil Case No. C-19928 on January 07, 2002. Respondent is guilty in abetting the conduct of his clients, Sps. Tuazon. He has clearly violated his lawyer's oath not to promote or sue groundless, false or unlawful suits among others. Instead of counseling his clients to abide and obey the decision of our Supreme Court, the final arbiter of all controversies and disputes, he is showing disrespect to a final and executory decision of our court. [13]\nIn his Comment, [14] respondent denied the allegations against him. While he admitted that he filed Civil Case No. C-19928 as counsel for the plaintiff therein, he claimed that it was not filed with malicious intent. Moreover, while the new case involved the same party, it was for a different cause of action and relief, and, as such, the principle of res judicata did not apply. He further explained that the complaint in Civil Case No. C-14542 was for declaratory relief or reformation of instrument, while Civil Case No. 19928 was for annulment of title. He accepted the case based on \"his professional appreciation that his client had a good case.\"\n\nIn his Reply, [15] the complainant stressed that the respondent was guilty of forum shopping; Civil Case No. C-19928 was nothing but a revival of the old complaint; and \"the lame excuse of the respondent that the present case is an action in rem while the other case is an action in personam \" did not merit consideration.\n\nOn November 25, 2002, the Court resolved to refer the matter to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation. [16]\n\nOn September 1, 2003, the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline assigned the case to Commissioner Salvador L. Pe\u00f1a. Only the counsel for the respondent appeared at the mandatory conference held on September 30, 2003. Finding that there were no factual issues in the case, Commissioner Pe\u00f1a terminated the mandatory conference and ordered the parties to submit their respective verified Position Papers, and, thereafter, considered the case submitted for resolution.\n\nThe case was re-assigned to Commissioner Doroteo B. Aguila who submitted his Report and Recommendation dated May 9, 2005, finding the respondent guilty of misconduct. It was recommended that respondent be meted a two months' suspension from the practice of law.\n\nAccording to the Investigating Commissioner, the elements of res judicata are present in this case as to bar the filing of Civil Case No. C-19928 since (a) the judgment in Civil Case No. C-14542, upholding the validity of the absolute deed of sale, had attained finality; (b) the court which rendered the decision had the required jurisdiction; and (c) the disposition of the case was a judgment on the merits.\n\nOn October 22, 2005, the Board of Governors of the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline issued Resolution No. XVII-2005-108, adopting said Report and Recommendation with the modification that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months.\n\nWe agree that respondent is administratively liable.\n\nIn this case, it is clear that respondent is guilty of forum shopping. By his own admission, he was aware that Civil Case No. C-14542 was already final and executory when he filed the second case (Civil Case No. C-19928). His allegation that he \"was not the original counsel of his clients\" and that \"when he filed the subsequent case for nullity of TCT, his motive was to protect the rights of his clients whom he believed were not properly addressed in the prior case for reformation and quieting of title,\" deserves scant consideration. As a responsible member of the bar, he should have explained the effect of such final and executory decision on his clients\" rights, instead of encouraging them to file another case involving the same property and asserting the same rights.\n\nThe essence of forum shopping is the filing of multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively, for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment. It exists when, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion in another, or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause to increase the chances of obtaining a favorable decision. An important factor in determining its existence is the vexation caused to the courts and the parties-litigants by the filing of similar cases to claim substantially the same reliefs. [17] Forum shopping exists where the elements of litis pendentia are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in another. [18] Thus, the following requisites should concur:\n(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions, (b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts, and (c) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration. x x x [19]\nThe fact that the parties in the first and second cases are not identical will not prevent the application of the principle of res judicata. Mere substantial identity of parties, or a community of interests between a party in the first case and a party in the subsequent case, even if the latter was not impleaded in the first case, is sufficient. [20] Moreover, a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies . [21] This was what respondent resorted to in order to give some semblance of merit to the complaint for annulment of title. He should have realized that the ruling of the Court in Tuazon v. Court of Appeals [22] effectively determined with finality the rights and obligations of the parties under the questioned deed of sale.\n\nA lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client but not at the expense of truth and the administration of justice. [23] The filing of multiple petitions constitutes abuse of the Court's processes and improper conduct that tends to impede, obstruct and degrade the administration of justice and will be punished as contempt of court. Needless to state, the lawyer who files such multiple or repetitious petitions (which obviously delays the execution of a final and executory judgment) subjects himself to disciplinary action for incompetence (for not knowing any better) or for willful violation of his duties as an attorney to act with all good fidelity to the courts, and to maintain only such actions as appear to him to be just and are consistent with truth and honor. [24]\n\nThe filing of another action concerning the same subject matter, in violation of the doctrine of res judicata , runs contrary to Canon 12 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which requires a lawyer to exert every effort and consider it his duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. By his actuations, respondent also violated Rule 12.02 [25] and Rule 12.04 [26] of the Code, as well as a lawyer's mandate \"to delay no man for money or malice.\" [27]\n\nLawyers should be reminded that their primary duty is to assist the courts in the administration of justice. Any conduct which tends to delay, impede or obstruct the administration of justice contravenes such lawyer's duty. Indeed, the Court has time and again warned not to resort to forum shopping for this practice clogs the court dockets. [28]\n\nWhile we rule that the respondent should be sanctioned for his actions, we also note that the power to disbar should be exercised with great caution, to be imposed only in a clear case of misconduct that seriously affects the standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the Court and as a member of the bar. Disbarment should never be decreed where any lesser penalty could accomplish the end desired. [29]\n\nWHEREFORE , for violating Canon 12 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, respondent Atty. Carmelito A. Montano is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months. He is STERNLY WARNED that any future violation of his duties as a lawyer will be dealt with more severely. This Decision is immediately executory. Atty. Montano is DIRECTED to inform the Court of the date of receipt of this decision.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairman), Ynares-Santiago and Austria-Martinez, JJ., concur.\nChico-Nazario, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 17-24.\n\n[2] The judge who originally heard the case was Judge Antonio J.

SP No. 68011 reversing the decision of the Ombudsman in OMB-ADM-0-00-0112.\n\nThe Fact-Finding and Intelligence Bureau (FFIB) of the Office of the Ombudsman received an anonymous letter-complaint regarding an alleged anomalous garbage collection contract between the Municipality of Bacoor, Cavite, with Hinterland Freightliners, Inc., and other illegal transactions. In a newspaper report, reference was made to \"Colorum Dumpsites\" against concerned Directors and the following illegal acts of the Municipal Mayor of Bacoor and his wife:\nNegotiated purchase in 1999 of overpriced and expired medicines for the poor amounting to P2.7 million;\n\nPurchase of 1999 of assorted furnitures and fixtures amounting to P4 million without the benefit of public bidding;\n\nPurchase of monobloc chairs, tables and tents without the benefit of public bidding and the renting out of the same by the wife of the Municipal Mayor;\n\nUnlawful removal or transfer of civil service eligibles in the municipal government who are perceived to have opposed the alleged illegal acts of the Municipal Mayor. [2]\nThe FFIB of the Office of the Ombudsman resolved to investigate the complaint and newspaper report, docketed as CPL 99-2703.\n\nOn August 10, 1999, Bacoor Municipal Mayor Jessie B. Castillo issued a Memorandum [3] to all Department Heads of the municipality, directing them \"not to release any important document and/or records in [their] respective departments\" without his prior approval; failure to comply would mean disciplinary action.\n\nThe Officer-in-Charge of the FFIB issued Mission Order No. 99-177 directing FFIB Investigators Benhur J. Villamora, Rodolfo M. Dayrit, Pedro R. Abuzman, Jr., Roy Roque D. A. Dator and Eduardo F. Olaveria, Jr. to proceed to the Municipal Hall of Bacoor, Cavite, on August 25, 1999, to investigate and gather documents and information relative to the news report and to thereafter submit a report.\n\nThereafter, Assistant Graft Investigation Officers Pedro R. Abuzman, Jr. and Rodolfo M. Dayrit issued a subpoena duces tecum dated August 24, 1999 ordering the municipal officers to immediately submit to the FFIB certified true copies of the following documents:\n(1) Mr. JESUS FRANCISCO\nMunicipal Planning and Development Officer\nBidding Documents (In re: Garbage Collection, Medicines and Furnitures)\nContract to bid\nNotice of Award\nPublication\nAbstract\nList of PBAC members\nOther relevant documents\n(2) Mr. JERRY MAKALATAN\nMunicipal Accountant\nFinancial Statement for the year 1998 to present;\nJournals (Cash Disbursement Journal, Check Disbursement Journal and Cash Receipt Journal); and\nDisbursement Vouchers.\n(3) THE PERSONNEL OFFICER\nMunicipal Hall\nPersonal Data Sheets. Service Records and SALN of the following:\nMayor Jessie B. Castillo\nSalome Esagunde\nElvira Guerrero\nCouncilor Ba\u00f1as\nCouncilor Cortez\nCouncilor Ocampo\nCouncilor Del Rosario\nMr. Jerry Makalatan\nMr. Jesus Francisco [4]\nA separate subpoena was issued to the provincial auditor directing him to submit certified copies of the decision. The latter informed the agents, however, that he did not have the requested documents. The agents accepted the explanation of the provincial auditor.\n\nThe municipal officers named in the subpoena failed to comply, stating that the documents were voluminous. [5] They also told the agents that they had been prohibited by the municipal Mayor from releasing any important document and record without his prior approval. They requested the agents to ask the Mayor to allow them to release the documents, but the agents refused. The officers were given up to August 27, 1999 within which to comply with the order.\n\nOn August 30, 1999, Mayor Castillo issued another Memorandum, [6] reiterating his directive to Department Heads not to release any document without his approval \"or in his absence, that of Municipal Administrator Roel M. Zoleta.\" This included \"photocopies of documents since there exists no appropriation in the municipal budget where xerox copiers can be made into use for any other purpose except internally.\" The Mayor warned that in the government service, \"even a single centavo unaccounted for is still a graft case.\"\n\nWhen the FFIB agents returned to the Municipal Hall to secure the documents, the municipal officers again refused to comply with the subpoena. They also informed the FFIB agents that they had no other recourse but to comply with the Mayor's Memoranda and asked them to talk to the Mayor about it. The agents refused to do so, stating that the municipal officers were mandated to comply with the subpoena in spite of the Memoranda issued by the Mayor.\n\nThe investigators returned to the Bacoor Municipal Hall to enforce the subpoena against the concerned municipal officers, but they still refused to comply. Thus, on August 31, 1999, the FFIB issued an Order [7] directing the municipal officers \"to comply with the subpoena and explain within three (3) days why they should not be cited for contempt.\"\n\nFor his part, the Mayor filed an administrative complaint for harassment, oppression and grave abuse of authority with the Office of the Ombudsman against the FFIB agents. He alleged that there was only one investigation (CPL No. 99-2703) related to the complaint for \"colorum dumpsites\", but the FFIB agents had ordered the municipal officers who belonged to the political party to which he was affiliated to produce \"unrelated\" documents. The Mayor requested that the fact-finding investigators be suspended pending final resolution of his complaint.\n\nThereafter, the Chief Legal Counsel of the Office of the Ombudsman declared in a legal opinion that the FFIB investigation was not limited to the complaint on \"colorum dumpsites\" but included other matters like collection, medicine, furniture, among others. [8]\n\nThe municipal officers submitted their written explanation [9] as required by the FFIB. They declared that they were proscribed from complying with the FFIB's subpoena without prior notice and approval of the Mayor, who is their superior.\n\nOn February 29, 2000, the Graft Investigator issued an Order [10] preventively suspending respondents.\n\nMeantime, on July 21, 2000, FFIB Director Gerardo B. Lantoria, Jr. issued subpoena duces tecum ad testificandum to the Acting Municipal Accountant to appear before the FFIB, Office of the Ombudsman at 10:00 a.m. on April 5, 2000, and submit certified true copies of disbursement vouchers together with all the supporting documents relative to the following transactions of the Municipal Government of Bacoor, Cavite:\nPurchase in 1999 of medicines for the poor; Purchase in 1999 of assorted furniture and fixtures; and, Purchase in 1999 of monobloc chairs, tables and tents. [11] The municipal accountant was reminded that the investigation was confidential and that the documents must be handled pursuant to Section 3, Rule IV of the Implementing Rules of R.A. No. 6713.\n\nA separate subpoena [12] was issued to the Personnel Officer requesting him to appear before the FFIB, Office of the Ombudsman at 10:00 a.m. on April 5, 2000, and submit the following:\nRecords showing the transfers or movements of personnel within the Municipal Government of Bacoor, Cavite in 1998 and 1999; and\n\nRecords of official travel abroad of the officials and employees of the Municipal Government of Bacoor, Cavite in 1998 and 1999.\nThe officer was similarly reminded of the confidential nature of the investigation.\n\nOn March 28, 2000, the Mayor issued a Memorandum [13] dated March 21, 2000 to Municipal Accountant Makalatan and Personnel Officer De Castro to comply with the subpoena duces tecum of the FFIB in the interest of the service.\n\nThe municipal officers filed a motion for reconsideration of the Graft Investigator's February 29, 2000 Order. They declared that they were ready to comply with the subpoena of the FFIB Investigators.\n\nOn April 3 and 5, 2000, respondents De Castro and Makalatan partially complied with the subpoena of the FFIB Director and submitted the following documents:\nPurchase in 1999 of medicines for the poor;\nPurchase in 1999 of assorted furniture and fixtures; and\nPurchase in 1999 of monobloc chairs, tables and tents.\n(1) Records showing the transfers or movements of personnel within the Municipal Government of Bacoor, Cavite in 1998 and 1999;\n\n(2) Records of official travel abroad of the officials and employees of the Municipal Government of Bacoor, Cavite in 1998 and 1999. [14]\nOn March 28, 2000, the municipal officers' motion to lift their preventive suspension was denied for lack of merit. [15]\n\nThe FFIB agents thereafter submitted their joint affidavit on the complaint of the Mayor which, in part, reads:\nThat the undersigned investigators categorically deny that this investigation is politically motivated. To repeat, the case emanated from our Intelligence and Special Operations Group (ISOG), and we have accordingly acted on their recommendation. The undersigned investigators have no knowledge that the Mayor and some of the concerned officials belong to the same political party. Their records were subpoenaed based on information that these officers traveled abroad without travel authority. Be that as it may, complaints of this nature should be proceeded accordingly based on the merits, and not on the pretext that it is politically motivated;\n\nThat we believe that the act of the Mayor in filing the complaint against the undersigned investigators is to delay the conduct of the investigation, to muddle the issues and to make him appear as a martyr in the eyes of his constituents. The Honorable Mayor appears to a firm believer in the adage, that the \"best defense is offense\"; x x x [16]\nFor refusing to comply with the subpoena issued by the FFIB, the agents filed an administrative complaint for grave misconduct against Municipal Mayor Jessie B. Castillo, Municipal Treasurer Salome Esagunde, Municipal Accountant Jerry Makalatan, Municipal Personnel Head Emily de Castro and Municipal Planning Development Officer Jesus Francisco. The case was docketed as OMB-ADM-0-00-0112 (OMB-0-00-0261) and was investigated by the Administrative Adjudication Bureau of the Office of the Ombudsman.\n\nIn their joint counter-affidavit, [17] Makalatan, Francisco and De Castro alleged that when the investigators arrived in their office on August 25, 1999, they were informed to keep silent about their (agents') presence. Being na&luml;ve of such kind of legal procedure and considering the volume of the vital municipal documents the agents were requesting, they informed the Mayor. After reading the subpoena, they noticed that the documents were not related to the subject matter of the investigation as shown by the caption of the subpoena. They insisted that this violated the mandate of Section 3, Rule 21 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure and the well settled rule on subpoena duces tecum . [18] They averred that the documents demanded by the agents may be secured from the COA through the provincial auditor.\n\nIn the preliminary conference conducted in the administrative case, the parties agreed on the following issues:\nWhether or not the non-compliance by the respondents of the Subpoena Duces Tecum dated August 24, 1999 constitute Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service? and,\n\nWhether or not the issuance by respondent Castillo of the Memorandum dated August 10, 1999 to all the Department Heads of Bacoor, Cavite constitute Grave Misconduct or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service? [19] During the investigation, Atty. Eduardo F. Olaveria, Jr. declared that although respondents were subordinates of the Mayor, they were still obliged to comply with the subpoena.\n\nIn the meantime, Mayor Castillo was reelected during the May 14, 2001 elections.\n\nOn September 7, 2001, the Ombudsman approved a decision submitted by the Administrative Adjudication Board, through Graft Investigation Officer II Maria Isabel A. Alcantara, finding respondents, (except Salome Esagunde and Mayor Castillo) guilty of simple misconduct. The dispositive portion reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, respondents JERRY MAKALATAN, JESUS FRANCISCO and EMILY DE CASTRO are hereby found guilty of SIMPLE MISCONDUCT. Accordingly, they are meted the penalty of ONE (1) MONTH SUSPENSION WITHOUT PAY , pursuant to Section 25(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989). The instant administrative complaint against respondents JESSIE B. CASTILLO and SALOME ESAGUNDE is hereby DISMISSED .\n\nThe Mayor, Municipality of Bacoor, Cavite, is hereby directed to implement this Decision in accordance with law and to promptly inform this Office of compliance therewith.\n\nSO ORDERED. [20]\nThe Ombudsman rejected the municipal officers' defense that they merely obeyed the Mayor's Memoranda. It declared that under Section 15(8) of R.A. No. 6770, they were authorized to serve copies of the public documents listed and described in the subpoena. Respondents were mandated to comply with the subpoena issued by the Office of the Ombudsman through its deputies.\n\nThe Ombudsman further declared that respondent Makalatan had custody of the accounting records as early as 1994 or 1995, hence, was obliged to furnish the FFIB with copies. As stated in the letter-opinion dated September 2, 1999 of the Ombudsman's Chief Legal Counsel, the investigation of the FFIB was not \"limited to the colorum dumpsites\" and included other matters like collectors, medicines, furniture, among others. If, at all, the subsequent compliance of Makalatan and De Castro merely mitigated their administrative liability.\n\nRespondent Municipal Treasurer was absolved of the charge because the accounting records had already been transferred to respondent Makalatan in 1994 or 1995. The complaint against the Mayor was dismissed because he was reelected; this served as a condonation of the charges of misconduct lodged against him.\n\nRespondents Makalatan, Francisco and De Castro filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision, which the Ombudsman resolved to deny. [21]\n\nRespondents Francisco, Makalatan and De Castro filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court with the CA, assailing the decision and resolution of the Ombudsman on the following grounds:\n\nRESPONDENTS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR IN RENDERING THE DECISION DATED SEPTEMBER 7, 2001 AND ORDER DATED OCTOBER 25, 2001 DEFYING BOTH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE THEREON DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT PETITIONERS NEVER COMMITTED MISCONDUCT UNDER THE PREMISES;\n\nTHE RESPONDENTS HAVE NO JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE. [22]\nRespondents averred that the Ombudsman erred in finding them guilty of simple misconduct and insisted that they acted in good faith. They merely complied with the Memoranda of the Municipal Mayor which prohibited them from furnishing the FFIB agents with copies of the public documents in their custody. To show their good faith, they pleaded to the FFIB agents to talk to the Mayor, but the latter refused. They should not be dealt with administratively and sanctioned for their failure to comply with the subpoena of the FFIB. They maintained that they were in a \"damned if you do and damned if you don't\" situation.\n\nThey likewise averred that, under the Local Government Code, the Municipal Mayor has administrative supervision over all executive officials and employees of the municipality to ensure that they faithfully discharge their duties and functions under existing laws. Thus, they had no other choice but to follow Mayor Castillo's order. [23] Being mere subordinates of the Mayor, they had no other alternative but to comply with the Memorandum. [24]\n\nRespondents maintained that, under the law, good faith is presumed. They are not liable since failure to comply with the subpoena cannot be considered as \"misconduct\" under the law. The interest of public service was not prejudiced by the failure to obtain the required documents. The documents are public in character, thus can be obtained from other sources, such as from the Provincial Auditor of Cavite in Trece Martirez City.\n\nOn the second issue, respondents claimed that the offense for which they were charged falls under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission as provided in Book V, Title I, Chapter 3, Section 12(11), in relation to Book V, Title 1, Chapter 6, Section 47. Thus, the Administrative Adjudication Bureau had no jurisdiction.\n\nOn March 3, 2004, the CA granted the petition and reversed the decision of the Ombudsman. [25] The appellate court dismissed the complaint, holding that the Ombudsman had jurisdiction over the complaint. The CA also ruled that in the light of the ruling in Evangelista v. Jarencio , [26] the subpoena issued by the FFIB was in order. However, the appellate court ruled, petitioners could not be held guilty of simple misconduct since they were merely following the Memoranda issued by their superior, the Mayor. Had the FFIB secured the necessary approval from the Mayor, the municipal officers would have readily complied with the subpoena. The appellate court likewise found that the Mayor's Orders were not unlawful or illegal, and that petitioners discharged their duties without any wrongful intention.\n\nThe Ombudsman, through the Republic of the Philippines, filed the instant petition for review on certiorari , insisting that:\nI\nTHE ONE (1) MONTH SUSPENSION IMPOSED ON RESPONDENTS IS FINAL AND UNAPPEALABLE.\n\nII\nPETITIONER CORRECTLY ADJUDGED RESPONDENTS GUILTY OF SIMPLE MISCONDUCT. [27]\n\nOn the first ground, petitioner avers that, under Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 and under the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman, the Order imposing suspension without pay is final and executory, which cannot be assailed by way of petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court; hence, it behooved the CA to dismiss respondents' petition.\n\nOn the second ground, petitioner asserts that there is ample evidence to show that respondents are guilty of simple misconduct. Under R.A. No. 6770, the Ombudsman, through his representative, has ample authority to enter and inspect the premises of any office or agency and examine any book, record, file, document or paper in relation to any investigation. Under Section 26(4) of R.A. No. 6770, any officer or employee who delays or refuses to comply with the referral or directive of the Ombudsman or any of his deputies shall be a ground for disciplinary action against such officer or employee. The law does not require that such refusal or delay be deliberate or intentional. It is enough that the delay or refusal was committed by the requested government officer or employee. It insists that respondents' refusal to comply with the subpoena constituted nonfeasance, if not malfeasance; hence, the CA erred in reversing the decision of the Ombudsman finding them guilty of simple misconduct.\n\nIn their Comment on the petition, respondents aver that petitioner never raised in the CA the issue of whether the Ombudsman's decision finding them guilty of simple misconduct is not appealable. Petitioner is then estopped from raising the issue in this Court. Moreover, the subpoena issued by the FFIB does not conform to the requirements of Section 2, Rule 21 of the Rules of Court. The documents demanded by the FFIB are not prima facie evidence to prove the allegations about the \"colorum dumpsites,\" and the subpoena issued by the FFIB were in the nature of a general warrant.\n\nRespondents further assert that the decision of the CA absolving them of simple misconduct is correct. They acted in good faith when they opted not to comply with the subpoena; they had no other option but to seek the approval of the Mayor; otherwise, they could be administratively charged and sanctioned.\n\nWe agree with petitioner's contention that the decision of the Ombudsman finding respondents guilty of simple misconduct and ordering their suspension for one (1) month without pay is final and unappealable as provided in Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 and Administrative Order No. 07, Section 7, Rule III of the Office of the Ombudsman implementing Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770. The rule reads:\nSEC. 7. Finality and execution of decision. \u2013 Where the respondent is absolved of the charge, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary, the decision shall be final, executory and unappealable. In all other cases, the decision may be appealed to the Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review under the requirements and conditions set forth in Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the written Notice of the Decision or Order denying the motion for Reconsideration.\n\nAn appeal shall not stop the decision from being executory. In case the penalty is suspension or removal and the respondent wins such appeal, he shall be considered as having been under preventive suspension and shall be paid the salary and such other emoluments that he did not receive by reason of the suspension or removal.\n\nA decision of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative cases shall be executed as a matter of course. The Office of the Ombudsman shall ensure that the decision shall be strictly enforced and properly implemented. The refusal or failure by any officer without just cause to comply with an order of the Office of the Ombudsman to remove, suspend, demote, fine, or censure shall be a ground for disciplinary action against said officer. (Underscoring supplied)\nFrom the foregoing provisions, it was held in Lapid v. Court of Appeals [28] that orders, directives or decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative cases imposing the penalty of public censure, reprimand, or suspension of not more than one month, or a fine not equivalent to one month salary shall be final and unappealable. In all other cases, the aggrieved party is given the right to appeal within ten (10) days from receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision; thus, the judgment will become final after the lapse of the reglementary period of appeal, if no appeal is perfected or, an appeal therefrom having been taken. [29] In the instant case, since the penalty imposed upon respondents was \"one month suspension without pay\" only, as a matter of law, the decision of the Ombudsman is final and unappealable. As held in Herrera v. Bohol , [30] where petitioner therein was likewise found guilty of simple misconduct and suspended for one (1) month without pay, the decision of the Ombudsman can no longer be rectified, much less, reversed.\n\nSince the decision of the Ombudsman suspending respondents for one (1) month is final and unappealable, it follows that the CA had no appellate jurisdiction to review, rectify or reverse the same. [31] The Ombudsman was not estopped from asserting in this Court that the CA had no appellate jurisdiction to review and reverse the decision of the Ombudsman via petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. This is not to say that decisions of the Ombudsman cannot be questioned. Decisions of administrative or quasi-administrative agencies which are declared by law final and unappealable are subject to judicial review if they fail the test of arbitrariness, or upon proof of gross abuse of discretion, fraud or error of law. When such administrative or quasi-judicial bodies grossly misappreciate evidence of such nature as to compel a contrary conclusion, the Court will not hesitate to reverse the factual findings. [32] Thus, the decision of the Ombudsman may be reviewed, modified or reversed via petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, on a finding that it had no jurisdiction over the complaint, or of grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction. [33]\n\nEven if the Court considers the petition filed with the CA as one for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, respondents, nevertheless, failed to prove that the Office of the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of its discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction in its decision.\n\nThere is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman when it acts in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of its judgment amounting to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. [34] The only question involved is jurisdiction, either the lack or excess thereof, and abuse of discretion warrants the issuance of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari only when the same is grave, as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice or personal hostility. A writ of certiorari is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment. [35] An error of judgment is one in which the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and which error is reversible only by an appeal. [36]\n\nSection 27(2) of R.A No. 6770 provides that findings of facts by the Office of the Ombudsman are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence. Thus, as long as there is substantial evidence to support the Ombudsman's decision, it will not be reversed. The rationale of the rule was enunciated in Young v. Office of the Ombudsman : [37]\nThe rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they could be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant. [38]\nUnder Section 18 of R.A. No. 6770, the Office of the Ombudsman is empowered to:\n(4) Direct the officer concerned, in any appropriate case, and subject to such limitations as it may provide in its rules of procedure, to furnish it with copies of documents relating to contracts or transactions entered into by his office involving the disbursement or use of public funds or properties, and report any irregularity to the Commission on Audit for appropriate action;\n\n(5) Request any government agency for assistance and information necessary in the discharge of its responsibilities, and to examine, if necessary, pertinent records and documents;\n\nx x x x\n\n(7) Determine the causes of inefficiency, red tape, mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the Government and make recommendations for their elimination and the observance of high standards of ethics and efficiency.\nIt must be stressed that the Office of the Ombudsman is endowed with a wide latitude of investigating power, virtually free from legislative, executive and judicial instruction. [39] The Ombudsman and his deputies are designated by the Constitution as protectors of the people, who are thus required to act promptly on complaints against public officers of the government or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof. [40] The general investigation on the Office of the Ombudsman is precisely for the purpose of protecting those against whom a complaint is filed against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution as much as securing the State from useless and expensive trials. [41] Moreover, the reason for the creation of the Ombudsman in the 1987 Constitution and for the grant to it of broad investigative authority is to insulate said office from the long tentacles of officialdom that are able to penetrate the judges' and other fiscals' offices, and others involved in the prosecution of erring public officials, and through the exertion of official pressure and influence, quash, delay or dismiss investigations into malfeasances and misfeasances committed by public officers. [42]\n\nTo achieve the objectives of the Constitution, the Office of the Ombudsman is empowered to administer oaths, issue subpoena and subpoena duces tecum , and take testimony in any investigation or inquiry, including the power to examine and have access to bank accounts and records which may be delegated to the deputy or its investigator to ensure the effective exercise or performance of the power, functions, and duties therein as provided in the law. [43] In any investigation under the law, the Ombudsman may examine and access any record, file, document or paper in any office, agency or commission or tribunal. [44] Delay or refusal to comply with the referral or directive of the Ombudsman or any of his deputies constitutes a ground for administrative disciplinary action against the officers or employee concerned. [45] Indeed, non-performance of an act which ought to be performed, omission to perform a required duty at all, or total neglect of duty constitutes nonfeasance. [46]\n\nThe officer or employee concerned may be excused or justified for being unable to comply with the subpoena duces tecum . However, the inability which excuses must be real. Self-created inability will not suffice; nor will passivity when reasonable efforts might secure compliance. Any excuse or exception for non-compliance is distinctly exceptional being derogative of the mandate of the law and must be established by clear and convincing evidence. [47]\n\nIn the instant case, respondents were ordered by the Office of the Ombudsman, through the FFIB, to submit certified true copies of the documents in their custody in connection with the on-going investigation against the Mayor and his wife. The documents subject of the subpoena were public documents in the custody of respondents. They were mandated to comply with the subpoena of the FFIB despite the Mayor's August 10, 1999 Memoranda prohibiting them from releasing important documents/records in their respective departments without his prior approval. Such a Memorandum is contrary to R.A. No. 6770. The duty of respondents to comply with the subpoena of the FFIB cannot be made subject to or dependent on the whims or caprice or prior approval of a higher officer. Indeed, in this case, the Mayor was unable to cite any law vesting him with the power to prohibit the municipal officers from furnishing the Ombudsman with certified copies of public documents in their custody without his prior approval.\n\nIt must be stressed that the Mayor is mandated to ensure that all officials and employees of the municipality faithfully discharge their duties and functions as provided by law and the Local Government Code. It appears, in this case, that the Mayor issued his Memoranda in anticipation, perhaps to derail the investigation of the Office of the Ombudsman relative to the complaints against him and his wife. By prohibiting respondents from complying with the subpoena, he prevented the FFIB agents from performing their constitutionally-mandated duty.\n\nRespondents' request for the FFIB agents to ask the Mayor to allow them to release certified copies of the documents cannot serve to support their claim of good faith. The FFIB agents were merely complying with the subpoena issued by the FFIB. Moreover, their Mission Order did not require them to speak to the Mayor and secure prior approval before releasing public documents. The Mayor cannot withhold the release of any public documents even if they may incriminate him and his wife. Neither were respondents justified in withholding such documents from the FFIB, being as they are documents for the benefit of the public and subject to public inspection. [48]\n\nIf respondents, indeed, were in good faith, it behooved them to file a motion with the FFIB to question its order and claim exemption from compliance with the subpoena because of the Mayor's Memoranda. In case of denial, respondents could then appeal to the Ombudsman; if this remedy failed, they could then have sought judicial relief. Respondents had no right to simply ignore the order and refuse to comply. Whether a witness has a reasonable excuse for failing to respond to a subpoena duces tecum is to be justified by the court or tribunal or government entity that issued it and not by the witness. While the witness may have a valid excuse for not showing the document sought by the subpoena, he is still bound to produce it. [49]\n\nRespondents are not mere employees of the municipality. They were heads of departments. They should have known that although the Mayor may have supervision over them, he had no power to prohibit them from complying with the lawful order of the FFIB. Respondents are mandated to obey only the lawful orders of the Mayor, and are as guilty as the former if they obey illegal orders. They knew that the Mayor had subsequently issued a Memorandum finally allowing them to comply with the subpoena of the FFIB; however, respondents De Castro and Makalatan's compliance was only partial, while respondent Francisco failed to comply. Such \"half-hearted compliance\" demonstrates respondents' defiance of the FFIB's order, despite the volte face of the Mayor. This conduct cannot be tolerated.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition is GRANTED .

Trial proceeded after which the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, Molave, Zamboanga del Sur rendered a Decision, [5] the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE, on the basis of the evidences admitted at the trial, this Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide, and hereby imposes the indeterminate penalty of eight years and one day of prision mayor as minimum, to fifteen years, of reclusion temporal as maximum, of imprisonment, and to pay the heirs of the deceased victim the sum of P165,000.00, itemized as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nMoral damages ------------------- | P 50,000.00\nExemplary damages --------------- | 50,000.00\nFuneral Expenses ----------------- | 65,000.00\nTotal ----------------------- | P 165,000.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nMoral damages ------------------- P 50,000.00 Exemplary damages --------------- 50,000.00 Funeral Expenses ----------------- 65,000.00 Total ----------------------- P 165,000.00 SO ORDERED. [6] On appeal, Sanchez averred that the trial court erred in not ruling that he acted in self-defense and in failing to appreciate the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and passion and obfuscation. Finding that unlawful aggression as an element of self-defense was not present, the Court of Appeals affirmed Sanchez's conviction. However, it decreased the penalty imposed in view of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. The dispositive portion of the Decision of the Court of Appeals provides:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered partly granting the instant appeal. The decision of the trial court is MODIFIED in so far as the penalty is concerned which should be SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) day of Prision Mayor as Minimum to TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) day of Reclusion Temporal as maximum. All other aspects of the decision are AFFIRMED. No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7]\nSanchez's account of the facts shows that he and Jamero were tenants of adjacent lots located in San Jose, Mahayag, Zamboanga del Sur. [8] At about 7:00 o'clock in the morning of September 4, 1993, Sanchez saw Jamero destroying the dike which served as the boundary between the two lots. Sanchez confronted Jamero and told the latter that he was encroaching on his land. Jamero struck him with a shovel. The shovel got stuck in the mud so Jamero resorted to throwing mud at Sanchez. Fighting back, Sanchez hacked Jamero with a bolo, resulting in the latter's death. [9] Sanchez then proceeded to the municipal building to surrender upon the advice of his son-in-law. [10]\n\nBased on these facts, Sanchez insists in his Petition [11] dated November 17, 2003, that he acted in self-defense. According to him, Jamero was the unlawful aggressor having struck him with a shovel. Had he not fought back by hacking Jamero with a bolo, he would have been the one killed.\n\nIn its Comment [12] dated September 16, 2004, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) maintains that the plea of self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, should fail because there was no longer any unlawful aggression on the part of Jamero when Sanchez hacked him.\n\nAccording to the OSG, Jamero's attack on Sanchez was unsuccessful because the latter was able to evade it and Jamero's shovel got stuck in the mud. Jamero fled toward the ricefield when Sanchez unsheathed his bolo. Sanchez pursued him and struck his head with a bolo. Jamero fell down but was able to stand up again. He ran away but after a short distance, fell down again. Sanchez approached him and stabbed him several times. Not satisfied, Sanchez pushed Jamero's face down into the knee-deep mud. After Jamero's aggression ceased when he fled and left his shovel stuck in the mud, there was no longer any justification for Sanchez to go after him and hack him to death.\n\nSanchez filed a Reply to Respondent's People of the Philippines Comment [13] dated November 11, 2004, reiterating that he acted in self-defense.\n\nWe sustain the Decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\nSelf-defense is an affirmative allegation and offers exculpation from liability for crimes only if satisfactorily shown. Self-defense requires: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed by the accused to repel it; and (c) lack of sufficient provocation on his part. [14]\n\nHaving admitted that he killed Jamero, the burden of evidence that one acted in self-defense shifted to Sanchez. It is textbook doctrine that when self-defense is invoked, the burden of evidence shifts to the appellant to show that the killing was justified and that he incurred no criminal liability therefor. He must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence, for, even if the latter were weak, it could not be disbelieved after his open admission of responsibility for the killing. Hence, he must prove the essential requisites of self-defense aforementioned. [15]\n\nIn this case, Sanchez failed to prove the element of unlawful aggression. The positive and categorical eye-witness account of Saturnino Umambac (Umambac) that Jamero ran away from Sanchez but that the latter pursued Jamero, caught up with him and hacked him to death negates Sanchez's plea of self-defense. Umambac testified:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nAtty. Pedro S.

[17]\nThere can be no self-defense, complete or incomplete, unless the accused proves the first essential requisite\u2013unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. Unlawful aggression presupposes an actual, sudden and unexpected or imminent danger on the life and limb of a person \u2013 a mere threatening or intimidating attitude is not sufficient. There must be actual physical force or a threat to inflict physical injury. In case of a threat, it must be offensive and positively strong so as to display a real, not imagined, intent to cause injury. Aggression, if not continuous, does not constitute aggression warranting self-defense. [18]\n\nIn this case, the twin circumstances of Jamero's shovel getting stuck in the mud and his running away from Sanchez convincingly indicate that there was no longer any danger to the latter's life and limb which could have justified his pursuit of Jamero and subsequent hacking and killing of the latter.\n\nSanchez's failure to prove unlawful aggression by Jamero and the prosecution's evidence conclusively showing that it was Sanchez who was the unlawful aggressor completely discounts Sanchez's claim of self-defense. Even incomplete self-defense by its very nature and essence would always require the attendance of unlawful aggression initiated by the victim which must clearly be shown.

      "title": "MACLARING M. LUCMAN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE MANAGER OF THE LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, MARAWI CITY, PETITIONER, VS. ALIMATAR MALAWI, ABDUL- KHAYER PANGCOGA, SALIMATAR SARIP, LOMALA CADAR, ALIRIBA S. MACARAMBON AND ABDUL USMAN, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N TINGA, J.: This is a petition for review challenging the decision of the trial court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, granting the petition for mandamus filed by herein respondents, Barangay Chairm0en (or Punong Barangay) of several barangays in the province of Lanao del Sur.The petition for mandamus filed by respondents before the trial court is rooted in their claim that they were deprived of their Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 1997. Respondents further alleged that these same funds were released by petitioner as Manager of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the depositary bank, to third persons.There were originally six (6) petitioners when the Petition for Mandamus with Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction was filed by now respondents before the court of origin. They were Alimatar Malawi, Abdulkhayr Pangcoga, Salimatar Sarip, Lomala Cadar, Aliriba S. Macarambon and Abdul Usman who were the incumbent barangay chairmen of Bubong Ngingir (Kabasaran), Ilian, Linindingan, Mapantao-Ingod, Paigoay and Rangiran, respectively, all from the Municipality of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur.[1] All of them were the incumbent barangay chairmen of their respective barangays prior to the 12 May 1997 barangay elections. The elections on 12 May 1997 in the aforesaid barangays resulted in a failure of elections. Thereafter, the special elections held in these barangays likewise resulted in a failure of elections.[2] Consequently, respondents remained in office in a holdover capacity pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1 ofR.A. No. 6679[3] and Comelec Resolution No. 2888 dated February 5, 1997.[4]Beginning with the second quarter of 1997, LBP was selected as the government depository bank for the IRAs of the abovementioned barangays.[5] Being a new government depositary bank for the IRA funds, the authorized public officials had to open new accounts in behalf of their government units with the proper LBP branch from which they could withdraw the IRAs.[6]After the failed 12 May 1997 elections, respondents attempted to open their respective barangays' IRA bank accounts but were refused by petitioner because respondents needed to show their individual certifications showing their right to continue serving as Barangay Chairmen and the requisite Municipal Accountant's Advice giving respondents the authority to withdraw IRA deposits.[7] The requirement for the Accountant's Advice stemmed from Commission on Audit Circular No. 94-004.[8]Respondents were eventually allowed to open accounts for their barangays except for Lomala Cadar and Abdul Usman of barangays Mapantao-Ingud and Rangiran, respectively, because the accounts for these barangays were previously opened by two persons who presented themselves as the duly proclaimed Barangay Chairmen for these same barangays.[9]In any event, all respondents were not allowed to withdraw the IRA funds from the opened accounts, owing to the absence of the requisite Accountant's Advice.[10]Then on 4 August 1997, five (5) other persons presented themselves before petitioner as the newly proclaimed Punong Barangays of the five barangays concerned,[11] each of them presenting a certification of his election as Punong Barangay issued by the provincial director of the DILG-ARMM and another Certification issued by the Local Government Operations Officer attesting, among others, to the revocation of the certification previously issued to respondents.[12] Without verifying the authenticity of the certifications presented by these third persons, petitioner proceeded to release the IRA funds for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 1997 to them.[13] Respondents thus filed on 11 August 1997 a special civil action for Mandamus with Application for Preliminary Mandatory Injunction docketed as Civil Case No. 11-106, to compel petitioner to allow them to open and maintain deposit accounts covering the IRAs of their respective barangays and to withdraw therefrom.[14] The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lanao del Sur, Branch 11.[15]At the trial respondents Sarip, Cadar, Pangcoga and Usman testified that they were duly elected chairpersons of their respective barangays and continued as such in a holdover capacity until their re-election on 30 August 1997. They testified further that despite presenting the corresponding documents, petitioner refused to allow the withdrawal of the funds.[16]Respondent Macarambon testified that he was the incumbent chairperson of Barangay Paigoay prior to the 12 May 1997 elections and that due to the failure of elections, he continued to occupy his position in a holdover capacity until he was succeeded by his wife upon the latter's election to the same post. He testified on petitioner's refusal to release the money to him despite his submission of the Accountant's Advice.[17]For failure to appear at the scheduled hearing on 20 April 1999, petitioner was held as in default and respondents were allowed to present evidence ex parte. Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the Order declaring him as in default was granted.[18]After failing again to appear on the given time for him to adduce evidence, another Order was issued wherein petitioner was deemed to have waived his right to present evidence. The Order was lifted on petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. Instead of presenting evidence, petitioner filed on 10 November 1999 a Motion to Dispense or Waive Presentation of Evidence wherein he represented that the prayers in the complaint had already been complied with.[19] The RTC granted petitioner's motion through an Order dated 24 September 1999.[20]Thereafter, the RTC rendered a Decision[21] dated 8 October 1999 commanding petitioner to pay respondents, except respondent Alimatar Malawi who failed to testify, the IRAs of their respective barangays \"even without the Accountant's Advice.\"[22] The dispositive portion of the Decision reads, to wit:WHEREFORE, premises all considered, the instant petition is hereby granted. Accordingly, Mr. Maclaring M. Lucman, Manager of the Land Bank of the Philippines, Marawi City branch, is hereby ordered to pay the following:[23] Aliriba Macarambon, the 2nd Quarter IRA of Paigoay, Pagayawan in the sum of P48,200.00;Salimatar Sarip of Linindingan the2nd Quarter IRA - - - P54,220.003rd Quarter IRA - - - P54,220.00 Lomala S. Cadar of Mapantao the2nd Quarter IRA - - - P54,320.003rd Quarter IRA - - - P54,320.00Abdulkhay Pangcoga of Ilian the2nd Quarter IRA - - - P53, 361.003rd Quarter IRA - - - P53,361.00Abdul Usman of Rangiran the2nd Quarter IRA - - - P51,185.003rd Quarter IRA - - - P51,185.00even without the Accountant's Advice and the subsequent IRAs until their term of office shall have expired.SO ORDERED.[24]The RTC gave no credence to petitioner's assertion of payment to the rightful barangay officers, there having been no testimonial or documentary evidence proferred in substantiation thereof.[25] It considered petitioner's refusal to present evidence as a \"silence\" that equates to an admission of respondents' allegations.[26] Furthermore, the RTC relied on the testimonies and certifications adduced by respondents in holding that they were occupying their positions in a holdover capacity[27]and that by virtue thereof, they had \"the perfect right to continue performing the duties and functions of their positions including the withdrawal of funds of their respective barangays.\"[28]The Court of Appeals[29] affirmed the RTC's Decision in toto. Hence, this petition.Petitioner argues that respondents have no cause of action against him since they failed to present valid certifications showing their respective right to continue serving as Punong Barangay as well as the requisite Municipal Accountant's Advice. Petitioner also asserts that the LBP Marawi Branch had already released the contested IRAs to the Barangay Treasurers who were acting in conjunction with the duly recognized Punong Barangays, thereby making the petition for mandamus moot and academic.[30] These are factual issues that are generally beyond the review of this Court.Petitioner adds that respondents have no legal personality to institute the petition for mandamus in their own names since the IRAs rightfully belong to the respective barangays and not to them and that their respective barangays already received the claimed IRAs in this instant case.[31]For the proper adjudication of the present petition, two related core issues have to be resolved. First, what is the cause of action alleged in the initiatory pleading filed by respondents before the trial court? Second, are there indispensable parties which were not impleaded?Although the pleading filed before the lower court was denominated as a Petition for Mandamus With Prayer For Writ of Preliminary Injunction, the allegations thereof indicate that it is an action for specific performance, particularly to compel petitioner to allow withdrawal of funds from the accounts of the barangays headed by respondents with the LBP, Marawi Branch. Thus, the Petition alleged:\"12. Despite the opening of deposit accounts for the barangays mentioned in the preceding paragraph, respondent, without any valid or lawful cause, failed and refused, and still fails and refuses, to allow the withdrawal of the funds or IRA of the said barangays as evidenced by the WITHDRAWAL CHECKS (attached as Annexes \"D\" to \"D-3\" hereof) of said barangays which were refused payment when presented to the Land Bank on August 4, 1997.\"[32]From the records of the case, it appears that the shares of the barangays in the IRA had already been remitted by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to the LBP Marawi Branch where they were kept in the accounts opened in the names of the barangays.By virtue of the deposits, there exists between the barangays as depositors and LBP a creditor-debtor relationship. Fixed, savings, and current deposits of money in banks and similar institutions are governed by the provisions concerning simple loan.[33] In other words, the barangays are the lenders while the bank is the borrower.This Court elucidated on the matter in Guingona, Jr., et al. v. The City Fiscal of Manila, et al.,[34] citing Serrano v. Central Bank of the Philippines,[35] thus:Bank deposits are in the nature of irregular deposits. They are really loans because they earn interest. All kinds of bank deposits, whether fixed, savings, or current are to be treated as loans and are to be covered by the law on loans (Art. 1980, Civil Code; Gullas v. Phil. National Bank, 62 Phil. 519). Current and savings deposits are loans to a bank because it can use the same. The petitioner here in making time deposits that earn interest with respondent Overseas Bank of Manila was in reality a creditor of the respondent Bank and not a depositor. The respondent Bank was in turn a debtor of petitioner. Failure of the respondent Bank to honor the time deposit is failure to pay its obligation as a debtor and not a breach of trust arising from a depository's failure to return the subject matter of the deposit. (Emphasis supplied.)[36]The relationship being contractual in nature, mandamus is therefore not an available remedy since mandamus does not lie to enforce the performance of contractual obligations.[37]This brings us to the second core issue.The IRA funds for which the bank accounts were created belong to the barangays headed by respondents. The barangays are the only lawful recipients of these funds. Consequently, any transaction or claim involving these funds can be done only through the proper authorization from the barangays as juridical entities.The determination, therefore, of whether or not the IRA funds were unlawfully withheld or improperly released to third persons can only be determined if the barangays participated as parties to this action. These questions cannot be resolved with finality without the involvement of the barangays. After all, these controversies involve funds rightfully belonging to the barangays. Hence, the barangays are indispensable parties in this case.An indispensable party is defined as parties-in-interest without whom there can be no final determination of an action.[38] The nature of an indispensable party was thoroughly discussed in Arcelona v. Court of Appeals,[39] to quote:An indispensable party is a party who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest, a party who has not only an interest in the subject matter of the controversy, but also has an interest of such nature that a final decree cannot be made without affecting his interest or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience. It has also been considered that an indispensable party is a person in whose absence there cannot be a determination between the parties already before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable. Further, an indispensable party is one who must be included in an action before it may properly go forward.A person is not an indispensable party, however, if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is separable from the interest of the other parties, so that it will not necessarily be directly or injuriously affected by a decree which does complete justice between them. Also, a person is not an indispensable party if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action, or if he has no interest in the subject matter of the action. It is not a sufficient reason to declare a person to be an indispensable party that his presence will avoid multiple litigation.[40]In Arcelona, the Court also dwelt on the consequences of failure to include indispensable parties in a case, categorically stating that the presence of indispensable parties is a condition for the exercise of juridical power[41] and when an indispensable party is not before the court, the action should be dismissed.[42] The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.[43]The joinder of indispensable parties is mandatory. Without the presence of indispensable parties to the suit, the judgment of the court cannot attain real finality. Strangers to a case are not bound by the judgment rendered by the court.[44]Clearly, this case was not initiated by the barangays themselves. Neither did the barangay chairmen file the suit in representation of their respective barangays. Nothing from the records shows otherwise. On this score alone, the case in the lower court should have been dismissed.Even if the barangays themselves had filed the case, still it would not prosper. The case involves government funds and as such, any release therefrom can only be done in accordance with the prevailing rules and procedures.The Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM) provides that the local treasurers shall maintain the depositary accounts in the name of their respective local government units with banks.[45] Under the Local Government Code, the treasurer is given the power, among others, to: (1) keep custody of barangay funds and properties; and (2) disburse funds in accordance with the financial procedures provided by the Local Government Code.[46] The same manual defines disbursements as constituting all cash paid out during a given period either in currency or by check.[47]Sec. 344 of the Local Government Code further provides for the following requirements in cases of disbursements, to wit:Sec. 344. No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose. Vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned, as to the validity, propriety, and legality of the claim involved. Except in cases of disbursements involving regularly recurring administrative expenses xxx approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.Thus, as a safeguard against unwarranted disbursements, certifications are required from: (a) the local budget officer as to the existence and validity of the appropriation; (b) the local accountant as to the legal obligation incurred by the appropriation; (c) the local treasurer as to the availability of funds; and (d) the local department head as to the validity, propriety and legality of the claim against the appropriation.[48] Further, the GAAM provides for the basic requirements applicable to all classes of disbursements that shall be complied with, to wit:a) Certificate of Availability of Fund.\u2013Existence of lawful appropriation, the unexpended balance of which, free from other obligations, is sufficient to cover the expenditure, certified as available by an accounting officer or any other official required to accomplish the certificate.Use of moneys appropriated solely for the specific purpose for which appropriated, and for no other, except when authorized by law or by a corresponding appropriating body.b) Approval of claim or expenditure by head of office or his duly authorized representative.c) Documents to establish validity of claim. \u2013 Submission of documents and other evidences to establish the validity and correctness of the claim for payment.d) Conformity of the expenditure to existing laws and regulations.e) Proper accounting treatment.[49]This prescribed legal framework governing the release and disbursement of IRA funds to the respective barangays disabuses from the notion that a barangay chairman, relying solely on his authority as a local executive, has the right to demand physical possession of the IRA funds allocated by the national government to the barangay. The right to demand for the funds belongs to the local government itself through the authorization of their Sanggunian.[50]One final note. There is no conclusive proof from the records showing that the IRA funds for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the barangays concerned remitted by the DBM had already beenwithdrawn from the LBP Marawi Branch. Considering the implications of this action of possibly depriving several local government units of their IRAs, the Court took the initiative to request the COMELEC to issue certifications on who were the duly elected chairmen of the barangays concerned. The COMELEC issued to this Court a list of the elected barangay chairmen which confirmed the re-election of respondents as barangay chairmen of their respective barangays.[51] If withdrawals were indeed made, whether by the respondents or by impostors, the matter deserves to be investigated since public funds are involved. Accordingly, we refer the matter to the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) for investigation and appropriate action.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Petition for Mandamus filed before the Regional Trial Court is ordered DISMISSED.The alleged withdrawals of deposits representing the Internal Revenue Allotments for the 2nd and 3rd Quarters of 1997 of the barangays concerned from the Land Bank of the Philippines, Marawi Branch, are referred to the DILG for investigation and appropriate action.

MACARAMBON AND ABDUL USMAN, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review challenging the decision of the trial court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, granting the petition for mandamus filed by herein respondents, Barangay Chairm0en (or Punong Barangay) of several barangays in the province of Lanao del Sur.\n\nThe petition for mandamus filed by respondents before the trial court is rooted in their claim that they were deprived of their Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) for the 2 nd and 3 rd quarters of 1997. Respondents further alleged that these same funds were released by petitioner as Manager of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the depositary bank, to third persons.\n\nThere were originally six (6) petitioners when the Petition for Mandamus with Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction was filed by now respondents before the court of origin. They were Alimatar Malawi, Abdulkhayr Pangcoga, Salimatar Sarip, Lomala Cadar, Aliriba S. Macarambon and Abdul Usman who were the incumbent barangay chairmen of Bubong Ngingir (Kabasaran), Ilian, Linindingan, Mapantao-Ingod, Paigoay and Rangiran, respectively, all from the Municipality of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur. [1] All of them were the incumbent barangay chairmen of their respective barangays prior to the 12 May 1997 barangay elections. The elections on 12 May 1997 in the aforesaid barangays resulted in a failure of elections. Thereafter, the special elections held in these barangays likewise resulted in a failure of elections. [2] Consequently, respondents remained in office in a holdover capacity pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1 of\n\nR.A. No. 6679 [3] and Comelec Resolution No. 2888 dated February 5, 1997. [4]\n\nBeginning with the second quarter of 1997, LBP was selected as the government depository bank for the IRAs of the abovementioned barangays. [5] Being a new government depositary bank for the IRA funds, the authorized public officials had to open new accounts in behalf of their government units with the proper LBP branch from which they could withdraw the IRAs. [6]\n\nAfter the failed 12 May 1997 elections, respondents attempted to open their respective barangays' IRA bank accounts but were refused by petitioner because respondents needed to show their individual certifications showing their right to continue serving as Barangay Chairmen and the requisite Municipal Accountant's Advice giving respondents the authority to withdraw IRA deposits. [7] The requirement for the Accountant's Advice stemmed from Commission on Audit Circular No. 94-004. [8]\n\nRespondents were eventually allowed to open accounts for their barangays except for Lomala Cadar and Abdul Usman of barangays Mapantao-Ingud and Rangiran, respectively, because the accounts for these barangays were previously opened by two persons who presented themselves as the duly proclaimed Barangay Chairmen for these same barangays. [9]\n\nIn any event, all respondents were not allowed to withdraw the IRA funds from the opened accounts, owing to the absence of the requisite Accountant's Advice. [10]\n\nThen on 4 August 1997, five (5) other persons presented themselves before petitioner as the newly proclaimed Punong Barangays of the five barangays concerned, [11] each of them presenting a certification of his election as Punong Barangay issued by the provincial director of the DILG-ARMM and another Certification issued by the Local Government Operations Officer attesting, among others, to the revocation of the certification previously issued to respondents. [12] Without verifying the authenticity of the certifications presented by these third persons, petitioner proceeded to release the IRA funds for the 2 nd and 3 rd quarters of 1997 to them. [13]\n\nRespondents thus filed on 11 August 1997 a special civil action for Mandamus with Application for Preliminary Mandatory Injunction docketed as Civil Case No. 11-106, to compel petitioner to allow them to open and maintain deposit accounts covering the IRAs of their respective barangays and to withdraw therefrom. [14] The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lanao del Sur, Branch 11. [15]\n\nAt the trial respondents Sarip, Cadar, Pangcoga and Usman testified that they were duly elected chairpersons of their respective barangays and continued as such in a holdover capacity until their re-election on 30 August 1997. They testified further that despite presenting the corresponding documents, petitioner refused to allow the withdrawal of the funds. [16]\n\nRespondent Macarambon testified that he was the incumbent chairperson of Barangay Paigoay prior to the 12 May 1997 elections and that due to the failure of elections, he continued to occupy his position in a holdover capacity until he was succeeded by his wife upon the latter's election to the same post. He testified on petitioner's refusal to release the money to him despite his submission of the Accountant's Advice. [17]\n\nFor failure to appear at the scheduled hearing on 20 April 1999, petitioner was held as in default and respondents were allowed to present evidence ex parte . Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the Order declaring him as in default was granted. [18]\n\nAfter failing again to appear on the given time for him to adduce evidence, another Order was issued wherein petitioner was deemed to have waived his right to present evidence. The Order was lifted on petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. Instead of presenting evidence, petitioner filed on 10 November 1999 a Motion to Dispense or Waive Presentation of Evidence wherein he represented that the prayers in the complaint had already been complied with. [19] The RTC granted petitioner's motion through an Order dated 24 September 1999. [20]\n\nThereafter, the RTC rendered a Decision [21] dated 8 October 1999 commanding petitioner to pay respondents, except respondent Alimatar Malawi who failed to testify, the IRAs of their respective barangays \"even without the Accountant's Advice.\" [22] The dispositive portion of the Decision reads, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, premises all considered, the instant petition is hereby granted. Accordingly, Mr. Maclaring M. Lucman, Manager of the Land Bank of the Philippines, Marawi City branch, is hereby ordered to pay the following: [23]\nAliriba Macarambon, the 2nd Quarter IRA of Paigoay, Pagayawan in the sum of P48,200.00;\nSalimatar Sarip of Linindingan the\n2nd Quarter IRA - - - P54,220.00\n3rd Quarter IRA - - - P54,220.00\nLomala S. Cadar of Mapantao the\n2nd Quarter IRA - - - P54,320.00\n3rd Quarter IRA - - - P54,320.00\nAbdulkhay Pangcoga of Ilian the\n2nd Quarter IRA - - - P53, 361.00\n3rd Quarter IRA - - - P53,361.00\nAbdul Usman of Rangiran the\n2nd Quarter IRA - - - P51,185.00\n3rd Quarter IRA - - - P51,185.00\n\neven without the Accountant's Advice and the subsequent IRAs until their term of office shall have expired.\n\nSO ORDERED. [24]\nThe RTC gave no credence to petitioner's assertion of payment to the rightful barangay officers, there having been no testimonial or documentary evidence proferred in substantiation thereof. [25] It considered petitioner's refusal to present evidence as a \"silence\" that equates to an admission of respondents' allegations. [26] Furthermore, the RTC relied on the testimonies and certifications adduced by respondents in holding that they were occupying their positions in a holdover capacity [27] and that by virtue thereof, they had \"the perfect right to continue performing the duties and functions of their positions including the withdrawal of funds of their respective barangays.\" [28]\n\nThe Court of Appeals [29] affirmed the RTC's Decision in toto. Hence, this petition.\n\nPetitioner argues that respondents have no cause of action against him since they failed to present valid certifications showing their respective right to continue serving as Punong Barangay as well as the requisite Municipal Accountant's Advice. Petitioner also asserts that the LBP Marawi Branch had already released the contested IRAs to the Barangay Treasurers who were acting in conjunction with the duly recognized Punong Barangays, thereby making the petition for mandamus moot and academic. [30] These are factual issues that are generally beyond the review of this Court.\n\nPetitioner adds that respondents have no legal personality to institute the petition for mandamus in their own names since the IRAs rightfully belong to the respective barangays and not to them and that their respective barangays already received the claimed IRAs in this instant case. [31]\n\nFor the proper adjudication of the present petition, two related core issues have to be resolved. First, what is the cause of action alleged in the initiatory pleading filed by respondents before the trial court? Second, are there indispensable parties which were not impleaded?\n\nAlthough the pleading filed before the lower court was denominated as a Petition for Mandamus With Prayer For Writ of Preliminary Injunction, the allegations thereof indicate that it is an action for specific performance, particularly to compel petitioner to allow withdrawal of funds from the accounts of the barangays headed by respondents with the LBP, Marawi Branch. Thus, the Petition alleged:\n\"12. Despite the opening of deposit accounts for the barangays mentioned in the preceding paragraph, respondent, without any valid or lawful cause, failed and refused, and still fails and refuses, to allow the withdrawal of the funds or IRA of the said barangays as evidenced by the WITHDRAWAL CHECKS (attached as Annexes \"D\" to \"D-3\" hereof) of said barangays which were refused payment when presented to the Land Bank on August 4, 1997.\" [32]\nFrom the records of the case, it appears that the shares of the barangays in the IRA had already been remitted by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to the LBP Marawi Branch where they were kept in the accounts opened in the names of the barangays.\n\nBy virtue of the deposits, there exists between the barangays as depositors and LBP a creditor-debtor relationship. Fixed, savings, and current deposits of money in banks and similar institutions are governed by the provisions concerning simple loan. [33] In other words, the barangays are the lenders while the bank is the borrower.\n\nThis Court elucidated on the matter in Guingona, Jr., et al. v. The City Fiscal of Manila, et al., [34] citing Serrano v. Central Bank of the Philippines , [35] thus:\nBank deposits are in the nature of irregular deposits. They are really loans because they earn interest. All kinds of bank deposits, whether fixed, savings, or current are to be treated as loans and are to be covered by the law on loans (Art. 1980, Civil Code; Gullas v. Phil. National Bank, 62 Phil. 519). Current and savings deposits are loans to a bank because it can use the same. The petitioner here in making time deposits that earn interest with respondent Overseas Bank of Manila was in reality a creditor of the respondent Bank and not a depositor. The respondent Bank was in turn a debtor of petitioner. Failure of the respondent Bank to honor the time deposit is failure to pay its obligation as a debtor and not a breach of trust arising from a depository's failure to return the subject matter of the deposit. (Emphasis supplied.) [36]\nThe relationship being contractual in nature, mandamus is therefore not an available remedy since mandamus does not lie to enforce the performance of contractual obligations. [37]\n\nThis brings us to the second core issue.\n\nThe IRA funds for which the bank accounts were created belong to the barangays headed by respondents. The barangays are the only lawful recipients of these funds. Consequently, any transaction or claim involving these funds can be done only through the proper authorization from the barangays as juridical entities.\n\nThe determination, therefore, of whether or not the IRA funds were unlawfully withheld or improperly released to third persons can only be determined if the barangays participated as parties to this action. These questions cannot be resolved with finality without the involvement of the barangays. After all, these controversies involve funds rightfully belonging to the barangays. Hence, the barangays are indispensable parties in this case.\n\nAn indispensable party is defined as parties-in-interest without whom there can be no final determination of an action. [38] The nature of an indispensable party was thoroughly discussed in Arcelona v. Court of Appeals , [39] to quote:\nAn indispensable party is a party who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest, a party who has not only an interest in the subject matter of the controversy, but also has an interest of such nature that a final decree cannot be made without affecting his interest or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience. It has also been considered that an indispensable party is a person in whose absence there cannot be a determination between the parties already before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable. Further, an indispensable party is one who must be included in an action before it may properly go forward.\n\nA person is not an indispensable party, however, if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is separable from the interest of the other parties, so that it will not necessarily be directly or injuriously affected by a decree which does complete justice between them. Also, a person is not an indispensable party if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action, or if he has no interest in the subject matter of the action. It is not a sufficient reason to declare a person to be an indispensable party that his presence will avoid multiple litigation. [40]\nIn Arcelona , the Court also dwelt on the consequences of failure to include indispensable parties in a case, categorically stating that the presence of indispensable parties is a condition for the exercise of juridical power [41] and when an indispensable party is not before the court, the action should be dismissed. [42] The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present. [43]\n\nThe joinder of indispensable parties is mandatory. Without the presence of indispensable parties to the suit, the judgment of the court cannot attain real finality. Strangers to a case are not bound by the judgment rendered by the court. [44]\n\nClearly, this case was not initiated by the barangays themselves. Neither did the barangay chairmen file the suit in representation of their respective barangays. Nothing from the records shows otherwise. On this score alone, the case in the lower court should have been dismissed.\n\nEven if the barangays themselves had filed the case, still it would not prosper. The case involves government funds and as such, any release therefrom can only be done in accordance with the prevailing rules and procedures.\n\nThe Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM) provides that the local treasurers shall maintain the depositary accounts in the name of their respective local government units with banks. [45] Under the Local Government Code, the treasurer is given the power, among others, to: (1) keep custody of barangay funds and properties; and (2) disburse funds in accordance with the financial procedures provided by the Local Government Code. [46] The same manual defines disbursements as constituting all cash paid out during a given period either in currency or by check. [47]\n\nSec. 344 of the Local Government Code further provides for the following requirements in cases of disbursements, to wit:\nSec. 344. No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose. Vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned, as to the validity, propriety, and legality of the claim involved. Except in cases of disbursements involving regularly recurring administrative expenses xxx approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed. Thus, as a safeguard against unwarranted disbursements, certifications are required from: (a) the local budget officer as to the existence and validity of the appropriation; (b) the local accountant as to the legal obligation incurred by the appropriation; (c) the local treasurer as to the availability of funds; and (d) the local department head as to the validity, propriety and legality of the claim against the appropriation. [48]\n\nFurther, the GAAM provides for the basic requirements applicable to all classes of disbursements that shall be complied with, to wit:\na) Certificate of Availability of Fund .\u2013Existence of lawful appropriation, the unexpended balance of which, free from other obligations, is sufficient to cover the expenditure, certified as available by an accounting officer or any other official required to accomplish the certificate.\n\nUse of moneys appropriated solely for the specific purpose for which appropriated, and for no other, except when authorized by law or by a corresponding appropriating body.\n\nb) Approval of claim or expenditure by head of office or his duly authorized representative.\n\nc) Documents to establish validity of claim. \u2013 Submission of documents and other evidences to establish the validity and correctness of the claim for payment.\n\nd) Conformity of the expenditure to existing laws and regulations.\n\ne) Proper accounting treatment . [49]\nThis prescribed legal framework governing the release and disbursement of IRA funds to the respective barangays disabuses from the notion that a barangay chairman, relying solely on his authority as a local executive, has the right to demand physical possession of the IRA funds allocated by the national government to the barangay. The right to demand for the funds belongs to the local government itself through the authorization of their Sanggunian. [50]\n\nOne final note. There is no conclusive proof from the records showing that the IRA funds for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the barangays concerned remitted by the DBM had already been\n\nwithdrawn from the LBP Marawi Branch. Considering the implications of this action of possibly depriving several local government units of their IRAs, the Court took the initiative to request the COMELEC to issue certifications on who were the duly elected chairmen of the barangays concerned. The COMELEC issued to this Court a list of the elected barangay chairmen which confirmed the re-election of respondents as barangay chairmen of their respective barangays. [51] If withdrawals were indeed made, whether by the respondents or by impostors, the matter deserves to be investigated since public funds are involved. Accordingly, we refer the matter to the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) for investigation and appropriate action.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Petition for Mandamus filed before the Regional Trial Court is ordered DISMISSED.\n\nThe alleged withdrawals of deposits representing the Internal Revenue Allotments for the 2nd and 3rd Quarters of 1997 of the barangays concerned from the Land Bank of the Philippines, Marawi Branch, are referred to the DILG for investigation and appropriate action. The DILG is hereby DIRECTED to INFORM the Court of the result of its investigation within thirty (30) days from the completion thereof.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, Carpio, Carpio-Morales , and Velasco, Jr. JJ., concur\n\n[1] RTC Decision, rollo , pp. 126-130.\n\n[2] CA Decision, id. at 24.\n\n[3] Id. at 126.\nSection 1.

NO. 159751, December 06, 2006 ]\n\nGAUDENCIO E. FERNANDO AND RUDY ESTORNINOS, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENT.DECISION\nGAUDENCIO E. FERNANDO AND RUDY ESTORNINOS, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari assails the Decision [1] dated March 21, 2003 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2003, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 25796, which affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila (RTC), Branch 21, in Criminal Case No. 99-176582.\n\nThe RTC convicted Gaudencio E. Fernando and Rudy Estorninos for violation of Article 201 [2] of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 960 and 969, and sentenced each to imprisonment of four (4) years and one (1) day to six (6) years of prision correccional , and to pay the fine of P6,000 and cost of suit.\n\nThe facts as culled from the records are as follows.\n\nActing on reports of sale and distribution of pornographic materials, officers of the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group in the National Capital Region (PNP-CIDG NCR) conducted police surveillance on the store bearing the name of Gaudencio E. Fernando Music Fair (Music Fair). On May 5, 1999, Judge Perfecto Laguio of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 19, issued Search Warrant No. 99-1216 for violation of Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code against petitioner Gaudencio E. Fernando and a certain Warren Tingchuy. The warrant ordered the search of Gaudencio E. Fernando Music Fair at 564 Quezon Blvd., corner Zigay Street, Quiapo, Manila, and the seizure of the following items:\nCopies of New Rave Magazines with nude obscene pictures;\nCopies of IOU Penthouse Magazine with nude obscene pictures;\nCopies of Hustler International Magazine with nude obscene pictures; and\nCopies of VHS tapes containing pornographic shows. [3] On the same day, police officers of the PNP-CIDG NCR served the warrant on Rudy Estorninos, who, according to the prosecution, introduced himself as the store attendant of Music Fair. The police searched the premises and confiscated twenty-five (25) VHS tapes and ten (10) different magazines, which they deemed pornographic.\n\nOn September 13, 1999, petitioners with Warren Tingchuy, were charged in an Information which reads as follows:\nThat on or about May 5, 1999, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, publicly and jointly exhibit indecent or immoral acts, scenes or shows at Music Fair, located at 564 Quezon Blvd., corner Zigay [S]t., Quiapo[,] this City[,] by then and there selling and exhibiting obscene copies of x-rated VHS Tapes, lewd films depicting men and women having sexual intercourse[,] lewd photographs of nude men and women in explicating (sic) positions which acts serve no other purpose but to satisfy the market for lust or pornography to public view.\n\nContrary to law. [4] When arraigned, petitioners and Tingchuy pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. Thereafter, trial ensued.\n\nThe prosecution offered the confiscated materials in evidence and presented the following witnesses: Police Inspector Rodolfo L. Tababan, SPO4 Rolando Buenaventura and Barangay Chairperson Socorro Lipana, who were all present during the raid. After the prosecution presented its evidence, the counsel for the accused moved for leave of court to file a demurrer to evidence, which the court granted. On October 5, 2000, the RTC however denied the demurrer to evidence and scheduled the reception of evidence for the accused. A motion for reconsideration was likewise denied.\n\nThereafter, the accused waived their right to present evidence and instead submitted the case for decision. [5]\n\nThe RTC acquitted Tingchuy for lack of evidence to prove his guilt, but convicted herein petitioners as follows:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused GAUDENCIO FERNANDO and RUDY ESTORNINOS GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and are hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of FOUR (4) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY as minimum to SIX (6) YEARS of prision correccional as maximum, to pay fine of P6,000.00 each and to pay the cost.\n\nFor failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of accused WARREN TINGCHUY beyond reasonable doubt, he is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged.\n\nThe VHS tapes and the nine (9) magazines utilized as evidence in this case are hereby confiscated in favor of the government.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6] Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. But the appellate courtlatter affirmed in toto the decision of the trial court, as follows,\nWHEREFORE, finding no reversible error on the part of the trial court, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED IN TOTO .\n\nCosts against accused-appellants.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7] Hence the instant petition assigning the following errors:\nRespondent court erred in convicting petitioner Fernando even if he was not present at the time of the raid\n\nRespondent erred in convicting petitioner Estorninos who was not doing anything illegal at the time of the raid. [8] Simply, the issue in this case is whether the appellate court erred in affirming the petitioners' conviction.\n\nPetitioners contend that the prosecution failed to prove that at the time of the search, they were selling pornographic materials. Fernando contends that since he was not charged as the owner of an establishment selling obscene materials, the prosecution must prove that he was present during the raid and that he was selling the said materials. Moreover, he contends that the appellate court's reason for convicting him, on a presumption of continuing ownership shown by an expired mayor's permit, has no sufficient basis since the prosecution failed to prove his ownership of the establishment. Estorninos, on the other hand, insists that he was not an attendant in Music Fair, nor did he introduce himself so. [9]\n\nThe Solicitor General counters that owners of establishments selling obscene publications are expressly held liable under Article 201, and petitioner Fernando's ownership was sufficiently proven. As the owner, according to the Solicitor General, Fernando was naturally a seller of the prohibited materials and liable under the Information. The Solicitor General also maintains that Estorninos was identified by Barangay Chairperson Socorro Lipana as the store attendant, thus he was likewise liable. [10]\n\nAt the outset, we note that the trial court gave petitioners the opportunity to adduce evidence to disprove refute the prosecution's evidence. [11] Instead, they waived their right to present evidence submitted the case for decision.[A1] [12] The trial court therefore resolved the case on the basis of prosecution's evidence against the petitioners.\n\nAs obscenity is an unprotected speech which the State has the right to regulate, the State in pursuing its mandate to protect, as parens patriae , the public from obscene, immoral and indecent materials must justify the regulation or limitation.\n\nOne such regulation is Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code. To be held liable, the prosecution must prove that (a) the materials, publication, picture or literature are obscene; and (b) the offender sold, exhibited, published or gave away such materials. [13] Necessarily, that the confiscated materials are obscene must be proved.\n\nAlmost a century has passed since the Court first attempted to define obscenity in People v. Kottinger . [14] There the Court defined obscenity as something which is offensive to chastity, decency or delicacy. The test to determine the existence of obscenity is, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscene, is to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication or other article charged as being obscene may fall. [15] Another test according to Kottinger is \"that which shocks the ordinary and common sense of men as an indecency.\" [16] But, Kottinger hastened to say that whether a picture is obscene or indecent must depend upon the circumstances of the case, and that ultimately, the question is to be decided by the judgment of the aggregate sense of the community reached by it. [17]\n\nThereafter, the Court in People v. Go Pin [18] and People v. Padan y Alova, et al., [19] involving a prosecution under Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code, laid the tests which did little to clearly draw the fine lines of obscenity.\n\nIn People v. Go Pin , the Court said:\nIf such pictures, sculptures and paintings are shown in art exhibits and art galleries for the cause of art, to be viewed and appreciated by people interested in art, there would be no offense committed. However, the pictures here in question were used not exactly for art's sake but rather for commercial purposes. In other words, the supposed artistic qualities of said pictures were being commercialized so that the cause of art was of secondary or minor importance. Gain and profit would appear to have been the main, if not the exclusive consideration in their exhibition; and it would not be surprising if the persons who went to see those pictures and paid entrance fees for the privilege of doing so, were not exactly artists and persons interested in art and who generally go to art exhibitions and galleries to satisfy and improve their artistic tastes, but rather people desirous of satisfying their morbid curiosity and taste, and lust, and for love [of] excitement, including the youth who because of their immaturity are not in a position to resist and shield themselves from the ill and perverting effects of these pictures. [20] People v. Padan y Alova, et al. in a way reaffirmed the standards set in Go Pin but with its own test of \"redeeming feature.\" The Court therein said that:\n[A]n actual exhibition of the sexual act, preceded by acts of lasciviousness, can have no redeeming feature. In it, there is no room for art. One can see nothing in it but clear and unmitigated obscenity, indecency, and an offense to public morals, inspiring and causing as it does, nothing but lust and lewdness, and exerting a corrupting influence specially on the youth of the land. [21] Notably, the Court in the later case of Gonzales v. Kalaw Katigbak , [22] involving motion pictures, still applied the \"contemporary community standards\" of Kottinger but departed from the rulings of Kottinger , Go Pin and Padan y Alova in that the Court measures obscenity in terms of the \"dominant theme\" of the material taken as a \"whole\" rather than in isolated passages.\n\nLater, in Pita v. Court of Appeals , concerning alleged pornographic publications, the Court recognized that Kottinger failed to afford a conclusive definition of obscenity, and that both Go Pin and Padan y Alova raised more questions than answers such as, whether the absence or presence of artists and persons interested in art and who generally go to art exhibitions and galleries to satisfy and improve their artistic tastes, determine what art is; or that if they find inspiration in the exhibitions, whether such exhibitions cease to be obscene. [23] Go Pin and Padan y Alova gave too much latitude for judicial arbitrament, which has permitted ad lib of ideas and \"two-cents worths\" among judges as to what is obscene or what is art. [24]\n\nThe Court in Pita also emphasized the difficulty of the question and pointed out how hazy jurisprudence is on obscenity and how jurisprudence actually failed to settle questions on the matter. Significantly, the dynamism of human civilization does not help at all. It is evident that individual tastes develop, adapt to wide-ranging influences, and keep in step with the rapid advance of civilization. [25] It seems futile at this point to formulate a perfect definition of obscenity that shall apply in all cases.\n\nThere is no perfect definition of \"obscenity\" but the latest word is that of Miller v. California which established basic guidelines, to wit: (a) whether to the average person, applying contemporary standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. [26] But, it would be a serious misreading of Miller to conclude that the trier of facts has the unbridled discretion in determining what is \"patently offensive.\" [27] No one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive \"hard core\" sexual conduct. [28] Examples included (a) patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated; and (b) patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals. [29] What remains clear is that obscenity is an issue proper for judicial determination and should be treated on a case to case basis and on the judge's sound discretion.\n\nIn this case, the trial court found the confiscated materials obscene and the Court of Appeals affirmed such findings. The trial court in ruling that the confiscated materials are obscene, reasoned as follows:\nAre the magazines and VHS tapes confiscated by the raiding team obscene or offensive to morals? . . .\n\nPictures of men and women in the nude doing the sexual act appearing in the nine (9) confiscated magazines namely Dalaga, Penthouse, Swank, Erotic, Rave, Playhouse, Gallery and two (2) issues of QUI are offensive to morals and are made and shown not for the sake of art but rather for commercial purposes, that is gain and profit as the exclusive consideration in their exhibition. The pictures in the magazine exhibited indecent and immoral scenes and acts...The exhibition of the sexual act in their magazines is but a clear and unmitigated obscenity, indecency and an offense to public morals, inspiring...lust and lewdness, exerting a corrupting influence especially on the youth. (Citations omitted)\n\nThe VHS tapes also [exhibit] nude men and women doing the sexual intercourse. The tape entitled \"Kahit sa Pangarap Lang\" with Myra Manibog as the actress shows the naked body of the actress. The tape exhibited indecent and immoral scenes and acts. Her dancing movements excited the sexual instinct of her male audience. The motive may be innocent, but the performance was revolting and shocking to good minds...\n\nIn one (1) case the Supreme Court ruled:\nSince the persons who went to see those pictures and paid entrance fees were usually not artists or persons interested in art to satisfy and inspire their artistic tastes but persons who are desirous of satisfying their morbid curiosity, taste and lust and for [love] of excitement, including the youth who because of their immaturity are not in a position to resist and shield themselves from the ill and perverting effects of the pictures, the display of such pictures for commercial purposes is a violation of Art. 201. If those pictures were shown in art exhibits and art galleries for the cause of art, to be viewed and appreciated by people interested in art, there would be no offense committed (People vs. Go Pin, 97 Phil 418).\n\n[B]ut this is not so in this case. [30] Findings of fact of the Court of Appeals affirming that of the trial court are accorded great respect, even by this Court, unless such findings are patently unsupported by the evidence on record or the judgment itself is based on misapprehension of facts. [31] In this case, petitioners neither presented contrary evidence nor questioned the trial court's findings. There is also no showing that the trial court, in finding the materials obscene, was arbitrary.\n\nDid petitioners participate in the distribution and exhibition of obscene materials?\n\nWe emphasize that mere possession of obscene materials, without intention to sell, exhibit, or give them away, is not punishable under Article 201, considering the purpose of the law is to prohibit the dissemination of obscene materials to the public. The offense in any of the forms under Article 201 is committed only when there is publicity. [32] The law does not require that a person be caught in the act of selling, giving away or exhibiting obscene materials to be liable, for as long as the said materials are offered for sale, displayed or exhibited to the public. In the present case, we find that petitioners are engaged in selling and exhibiting obscene materials.\n\nNotably, the subject premises of the search warrant was the Gaudencio E. Fernando Music Fair, named after petitioner Fernando. [33] Even his bail bond shows that he lives in the same place. [34] Moreover, the mayor's permit dated August 8, 1996, shows that he is the owner/operator of the store. [35] While the mayor's permit had already expired, it does not negate the fact that Fernando owned and operated the establishment. It would be absurd to make his failure to renew his business permit and illegal operation a shield from prosecution of an unlawful act. Furthermore, when he preferred not to present contrary evidence, the things which he possessed were presumptively his. [36]\n\nPetitioner Estorninos is likewise liable as the store attendant actively engaged in selling and exhibiting the obscene materials. Prosecution witness Police Inspector Tababan, who led the PNP-CIDG NCR that conducted the search, identified him as the store attendant upon whom the search warrant was served. [37] Tababan had no motive for testifying falsely against Estorninos and we uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of his duties. Lastly, this Court accords great respect to and treats with finality the findings of the trial court on the matter of credibility of witnesses, absent any palpable error or arbitrariness in their findings. [38] In our view, no reversible error was committed by the appellate court as well as the trial court in finding the herein petitioners guilty as charged.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision dated March 21, 2003 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2003, of the Court of Appeals affirming the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 21, in Criminal Case No. 99-176582 are hereby AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, Carpio-Morales, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 44-52.\n\n[2] ART. 201.

SPOUSES RAYMOND AND MARIA HEDY VELAYO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeking the reversal of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated May 14, 2002 in CA-G.R. CV No. 54434 which affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 105, Quezon City (RTC) in Civil Case No. Q-93-17133; and the CA Resolution [2] dated October 1, 2002 which denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe procedural antecedents and factual background of the case are as follows:\n\nOn August 9, 1993, Raymond Velayo (Raymond) and his wife, Maria Hedy Velayo (respondents) filed a complaint for sum of money and damages with prayer for preliminary attachment against Erlinda R. Velayo-Fong (petitioner), Rodolfo R. Velayo, Jr. (Rodolfo Jr.) and Roberto R. Velayo (Roberto). [3] Raymond is the half-brother of petitioner and her co-defendants.\n\nIn their Complaint, respondents allege that petitioner, a resident of 1860 Alamoana Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, and her co-defendants, who are residents of the Philippines, made it appear that their common father, Rodolfo Velayo, Sr. (Rodolfo Sr.) and petitioner had filed a complaint against Raymond before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), accusing Raymond of the crimes of estafa and kidnapping a minor; that petitioner and her co-defendants also requested that respondents be included in the Hold Departure List of the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID) which was granted, thereby preventing them from leaving the country and resulting in the cancellation of respondents' trips abroad and caused all of respondents' business transactions and operations to be paralyzed to their damage and prejudice; that petitioner and her co-defendants also filed a petition before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) docketed as Case No. 4422 entitled \"Rodolfo Velayo Sr. et al. v. Raymond Velayo et al.\" which caused respondents' funds to be frozen and paralyzed the latters' business transactions and operations to their damage and prejudice. Since petitioner was a non-resident and not found in the Philippines, respondents prayed for a writ of preliminary attachment against petitioner's properties located in the Philippines.\n\nBefore respondents' application for a writ of preliminary attachment can be acted upon by the RTC, respondents filed on September 10, 1993 an Urgent Motion praying that the summons addressed to petitioner be served to her at Suite 201, Sunset View Towers Condominium, Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City and at No. 5040 P. Burgos Street, T. Towers Condominium, Makati. [4] In its Order dated September 13, 1993, the RTC granted the said motion. [5]\n\nThe Process Server submitted the Officer's Return, to wit:\nTHIS IS TO CERTIFY, that after several failed attempts to serve the copy of summons and complaint issued in the above-entitled case at the given addresses of defendant Erlinda Velayo as mentioned in the Order of this Court dated September 13, 1993, finally, on the 23 rd day of September, 1993, at the instance of herein plaintiffs through counsel, undersigned was able to SERVED (sic) personally upon defendant Erlinda Velayo the copy of summons together with the thereto attached copy of the complaint, not at her two (2) given addresses, but at the lobby of Intercontinental Hotel, Makati, Metro Manila, right in the presence of lobby counter personnel by the name of Ms. A. Zulueta, but said defendant refused to sign in receipt thereof.\n\nI FURTHER CERTIFY, that on the 27 th day of September, 1993, copy of the same WAS SERVED personally upon the other defendant Rodolfo R. Velayo, Jr., at No. Block 57, Lots 17 and 19, G. Sanchez Street, BF Resort Village, Las Pi\u00f1as, Metro Manila, but who also refused to sign in receipt thereof.\n\nWHEREFORE, original copy of the summons is now being respectfully returned to the Honorable Court DULY SERVED.\n\nQuezon City, Philippines, September 30, 1993. [6]\nUpon ex-parte motions [7] of respondents, the RTC in its Order dated November 23, 1993 and January 5, 1994, declared petitioner and her co-defendant in default for failure to file an answer and ordered the ex-parte presentation of respondents' evidence. [8]\n\nOn June 15, 1994, the RTC rendered its Decision in respondents' favor, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs:\nthe amount of P65,000.00 as actual damages;\n\nthe amount of P200,000.00 as moral damages;\n\nAttorney's fees in the amount of P5,000,00 it being a judgment by default; and\n\ncost of suit.\nSO ORDERED. [9]\nOn September 1, 1994, petitioner filed a Motion to Set Aside Order of Default claiming that she was prevented from filing a responsive pleading and defending herself against respondents' complaint because of fraud, accident or mistake; that contrary to the Officer's Return, no summons was served upon her; that she has valid and meritorious defenses to refute respondents' material allegations. [10] Respondents opposed said Motion. [11]\n\nIn its Order dated May 29, 1995, the RTC denied petitioner's Motion ruling that the presumption of regularity in the discharge of the function of the Process Server was not sufficiently overcome by petitioner's allegation to the contrary; that there was no evident reason for the Process Server to make a false narration regarding the service of summons to defaulting defendant in the Officer's Return. [12]\n\nOn September 4, 1995, respondents filed a Motion for Execution. [13] On September 22, 1995, petitioner filed an Opposition to Motion for Execution contending that she has not yet received the Decision and it is not yet final and executory as against her. [14]\n\nIn its Order dated January 3, 1996, the RTC, finding that the Decision dated June 15, 1994 and the Order dated May 29, 1995 were indeed not furnished or served upon petitioner, denied respondents' motion for execution against petitioner and ordered that petitioner be furnished the said Decision and Order. [15]\n\nOn March 28, 1996, the RTC issued an Order directing the issuance of the writ of execution against petitioner's co-defendant. [16]\n\nOn May 23, 1996, petitioner, through her counsel, finally received the Decision dated June 15, 1994 and the Order dated May 29, 1995. [17]\n\nPetitioner filed an appeal with the CA questioning the propriety and validity of the service of summons made upon her. Respondents opposed the appeal, arguing that the petition should be dismissed since it raised pure questions of law, which is not within the CA's jurisdiction to resolve under Section 2 (c) of Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court; that, in any case, petitioner's reliance on the rule of extraterritorial service is misplaced; that the judgment by default has long been final and executory since as early as August 1994 petitioner became aware of the judgment by default when she verified the status of the case; that petitioner should have filed a motion for new trial or a petition for relief from judgment and not a motion to set aside the order of default since there was already a judgment by default.\n\nOn May 14, 2002, the CA rendered its Decision affirming the Decision and Order of the RTC [18] ruling that it (CA) has jurisdiction since the petition raised a question of fact, that is, whether petitioner was properly served with summons; that the judgment by default was not yet final and executory against petitioner since the records reveal and the RTC Order dated January 3, 1996 confirmed that she was not furnished or served a copy of the decision; that petitioner was validly served with summons since the complaint for damages is an action in personam and only personal, not extraterritorial service, of summons, within the forum, is essential for the acquisition of jurisdiction over her person; that petitioner's allegations that she did not know what was being served upon her and that somebody just hurled papers at her were not substantiated by competent evidence and cannot overcome the presumption of regularity of performance of official functions in favor of the Officer's Return.\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration [19] but the CA denied it in its Resolution dated October 1, 2002. [20]\n\nHence, the present petition anchored on the following grounds:\nI\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS PATENTLY ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT PETITIONER WAS NOT VALIDLY SERVED WITH SUMMONS.\n\nII\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS PATENTLY ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT PETITIONER WAS PREVENTED FROM FILING RESPONSIVE PLEADING AND DEFENDING AGAINST RESPONDENTS' COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF FRAUD, ACCIDENT AND MISTAKE. [21]\nParties filed their respective Memoranda on September 8 and 9, 2005.\n\nPetitioner argues that summons should have been served through extraterritorial service since she is a non-resident; that the RTC should have lifted the order of default since a default judgment is frowned upon and parties should be given their day in court; that she was prevented from filing a responsive pleading and defending against respondents' complaint through fraud, accident or mistake considering that the statement in the Officer's Return that she was personally served summons is inaccurate; that she does not remember having been served with summons during the said date but remembers that a man hurled some papers at her while she was entering the elevator and, not knowing what the papers were all about, she threw back the papers to the man before the elevator closed; that she has a valid and meritorious defense to refute the material allegations of respondents' complaint.\n\nOn the other hand, respondents contend that petitioner was validly served with summons since the rules do not require that service be made upon her at her place of residence as alleged in the complaint or stated in the summons; that extraterritorial service applies only when the defendant does not reside and is not found in the Philippines; that petitioner erred in filing a motion to set aside the order of default at the time when a default judgment was already rendered by the RTC since the proper remedy is a motion for new trial or a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38; that the issue on summons is a pure question of law which the CA does not have jurisdiction to resolve under Section 2 (c) of Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. [22]\n\nThe Court finds it proper to resolve first whether the issue involved in the appeal filed with the CA is a question of law and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the CA to resolve.\n\nIn Murillo v. Consul , [23] which was later adopted by the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court clarified the three modes of appeal from decisions of the RTC, namely: (a) ordinary appeal or appeal by writ of error, where judgment was rendered in a civil or criminal action by the RTC in the exercise of original jurisdiction; (b) petition for review, where judgment was rendered by the RTC in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction; and (c) petition for review to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe first mode of appeal, governed by Rule 41, is taken to the Court of Appeals on questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law. The second mode of appeal, covered by Rule 42, is brought to the Court of Appeals on questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law. The third mode of appeal, provided for by Rule 45, is elevated to the Supreme Court only on questions of law.\n\nA question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. [24] For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. [25] The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact. [26] Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact. [27]\n\nRespondents' claim that the issues raised by petitioner before the CA are pure legal questions is not tenable.\n\nA scrutiny of petitioner's petition before the CA reveals that it raised two issues: (a) the propriety of the service effected on a non-resident; and (b) the validity of the service made upon her. The first is a question of law. There is indeed a question as to what and how the law should be applied. The second is a question of fact. The resolution of said issue entails a review of the factual circumstances that led the RTC to conclude that service was validly effected upon petitioner. Therefore, petitioner properly brought the case to the CA via the first mode of appeal under the aegis of Rule 41.\n\nHow may service of summons be effected on a non-resident?\n\nSection 17, [28] Rule 14 of the Rules of Court provides:\nSection 17. Extraterritorial service \u2013 When the defendant does not reside and is not found in the Philippines and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff or relates to, or the subject of which, is property within the Philippines, in which the defendant has or claims a lien or interest, actual or contingent, or in which relief demanded consists, wholly or in part, in excluding the defendant from any interest therein, or the property of the defendant has been attached in the Philippines, service may, by leave of court, be effected out of the Philippines by personal service as under section 7; or by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in such places and for such time as the court may order, in which case a copy of the summons and order of the court shall be sent by registered mail to the last known address of the defendant, or in any other manner the court may deem sufficient. Any order granting such leave shall specify a reasonable time, which shall not be less than sixty (60) days after notice, within which the defendant must answer.\nUnder this provision, when the defendant is a nonresident and he is not found in the country, summons may be served extraterritorially. There are only four instances when extraterritorial service of summons is proper, namely: (a) when the action affects the personal status of the plaintiffs; (b) when the action relates to, or the subject of which is property, within the Philippines, in which the defendant claims a lien or interest, actual or contingent; (c) when the relief demanded in such action consists, wholly or in part, in excluding the defendant from any interest in property located in the Philippines; and (d) when the defendant's property has been attached within the Philippines. In these instances, service of summons may be effected by (a) personal service out of the country, with leave of court; (b) publication, also with leave of court; or (c) any other manner the court may deem sufficient.\n\nThus, extrajudicial service of summons apply only where the action is in rem , that is, an action against the thing itself instead of against the person, or in an action quasi in rem , where an individual is named as defendant and the purpose of the proceeding is to subject his interest therein to the obligation or loan burdening the property. The rationale for this is that in in rem and quasi in rem actions, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is not a prerequisite to confer jurisdiction on the court provided that the court acquires jurisdiction over the res . [29]\n\nWhere the action is in personam , that is, one brought against a person on the basis of her personal liability, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is necessary for the court to validly try and decide the case. When the defendant is a non-resident , personal service of summons within the state is essential to the acquisition of jurisdiction over the person. [30] Summons on the defendant must be served by handing a copy thereof to the defendant in person, or, if he refuses to receive it, by tendering it to him. [31] This cannot be done, however, if the defendant is not physically present in the country, and thus, the court cannot acquire jurisdiction over his person and therefore cannot validly try and decide the case against him. [32]\n\nIn the present case, respondents' cause of action in Civil Case No. Q-93-17133 is anchored on the claim that petitioner and her co-defendants maliciously instituted a criminal complaint before the NBI and a petition before the SEC which prevented the respondents from leaving the country and paralyzed the latters' business transactions. Respondents pray that actual and moral damages, plus attorney's fees, be awarded in their favor. The action instituted by respondents affect the parties alone, not the whole world. Any judgment therein is binding only upon the parties properly impleaded. [33] Thus, it is an action in personam . As such, personal service of summons upon the defendants is essential in order for the court to acquire jurisdiction over their persons. [34]\n\nThe Court notes that the complaint filed with the RTC alleged that petitioner is a non-resident who is not found in the Philippines for which reason respondents initially prayed that a writ of preliminary attachment be issued against her properties within the Philippines to confer jurisdiction upon the RTC. However, respondents did not pursue its application for said writ when petitioner was subsequently found physically present in the Philippines and personal service of summons was effected on her.\n\nWas there a valid service of summons on petitioner? The answer is in the affirmative.\n\nPetitioner's bare allegation that the statement in the \"Officer's Return that she was personally served summons is inaccurate\" is not sufficient. A process server's certificate of service is prima facie evidence of the facts as set out in the certificate. [35] Between the claim of non-receipt of summons by a party against the assertion of an official whose duty is to send notices, the latter assertion is fortified by the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed. [36] To overcome the presumption of regularity of performance of official functions in favor of such Officer's Return, the evidence against it must be clear and convincing. Petitioner having been unable to come forward with the requisite quantum of proof to the contrary, the presumption of regularity of performance on the part of the process server stands.\n\nThe Court need not make a long discussion on the propriety of the remedy adopted by petitioner in the RTC of filing a motion to set aside the order of default at a time when there was already a judgment by default. As aptly held by the CA, since petitioner was not furnished or served a copy of the judgment of default, there was no notice yet of such judgment as against her. Thus, the remedy of filing a motion to set aside the order of default in the RTC was proper.\n\nPetitioner's argument that the RTC should have set aside the order of default and applied the liberal interpretation of rules with a view of affording parties their day in court is not tenable. While indeed default orders are not viewed with favor, the party seeking to have the order of default lifted must first show that her failure to file an answer or any other responsive pleading was due to fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable neglect and then she must show that she has a valid and meritorious defense. [37]\n\nIn this case, petitioner failed to show that her failure to file an answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable neglect. Except for her bare unsupported allegation that the summons were only thrown to her at the elevator, petitioner did not present any competent evidence to justify the setting aside of the order of default.\n\nMoreover, when a party files a motion to lift order of default, she must also show that she has a meritorious defense or that something would be gained by having the order of default set aside. [38] The term meritorious defense implies that the applicant has the burden of proving such a defense in order to have the judgment set aside. The cases usually do not require such a strong showing. The test employed appears to be essentially the same as used in considering summary judgment, that is, whether there is enough evidence to present an issue for submission to the trier of fact, or a showing that on the undisputed facts it is not clear that the judgment is warranted as a matter of law. [39] The defendant must show that she has a meritorious defense otherwise the grant of her motion will prove to be a useless exercise. Thus, her motion must be accompanied by a statement of the evidence which she intends to present if the motion is granted and which is such as to warrant a reasonable belief that the result of the case would probably be otherwise if a new trial is granted . [40]\n\nIn the present case, petitioner contented herself with stating in her affidavit of merit that the cases against respondent Raymond were filed at the instance of her father. [41] Such allegation is a conclusion rather than a statement of facts showing a meritorious defense. The affidavit failed to controvert the facts alleged by the respondents. Petitioner has not shown that she has a meritorious defense.\n\nThus, since petitioner failed to show that her failure file an answer was not due to fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable neglect; and that she had a valid and meritorious defense, there is no merit to her prayer for a liberal interpretation of procedural rules.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED .

NO. 155392, December 06, 2006 ]\n\nERLINDA GUANZON, PETITIONER, VS. ANDREW P. ARRADAZA, FRANCISCA MAIDIN AND ERLINDA LEBITA, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N\nERLINDA GUANZON, PETITIONER, VS. ANDREW P. ARRADAZA, FRANCISCA MAIDIN AND ERLINDA LEBITA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nRespondent Andrew B. Arradaza filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Manila, Branch 13, an Amended Complaint [1] against Francisca Maidin and Erlinda Lebita, Reynaldo Lebita, Erlinda Guanzon and Ruel Escarilla for Damages. He alleged that on 22 May 1995 at around 2:45 A.M., he boarded a jeepney that was cruising along Magsaysay Boulevard near Pureza Street, Manila. Respondent sat at the jeepney's rear portion.\n\nThe Amended Complaint further alleged that the jeepney was owned and operated by Francisca Maidin (Maidin) and Erlinda Lebita (Erlinda) with plate number NVD 734. Erlinda's husband, defendant Reynaldo Lebita (Reynaldo) was behind the wheel of the jeepney. Meanwhile, following the jeepney was a dump truck with plate number PCP 827 registered in the name of Erlinda Guanzon (Guanzon). On its wheel was defendant Ruel Escarilla (Escarilla). As neither of the two drivers were willing to give way to the other, the two vehicles collided.\n\nOwing to the said accident, respondent sustained injuries which required his confinement at the Orthopedic Hospital where he incurred medical expenses in the amount of seven thousand pesos (P7,000.00). He contends that defendant Reynaldo Lebita failed to exercise diligence in the operation of his vehicle while defendant Guanzon, the registered owner of the dump truck, failed to exercise due diligence in the selection and hiring of her driver in the person of Escarilla. Despite several demands, the defendants failed to reimburse the respondent for his actual damages. He claims, [2] that, he had since been absent from his work as a service crew member of a fastfood restaurant earning a salary of P145.00 per day and had been unable to enroll as an Engineering student in the 5th year.\n\nDefendants Maidin and Erlinda filed their Answer with cross-claim [3] against Escarilla and Guanzon, substantially arguing that it was defendant Escarilla who was at fault and whose negligence was the proximate and immediate cause of the accident and that Escarilla's employer, Guanzon, failed to exercise the diligence of a good father of the family in the selection and hiring of Escarilla.\n\nDefendant Reynaldo Lebita also filed his Answer with cross-claim [4] against Escarilla and Guanzon Lime Development Co. owned by defendant Guanzon.\n\nSummons was not served on Escarilla apparently on the ground that he was \"no longer connected with the firm\" Guanzon Lime and Development Co.\n\nDefendant Guanzon was furnished on 13 June 1996 with copies of the amended complaint and other pertinent papers via substituted service through a certain Susan Ador, after attempts exerted to cause personal service failed. [5] For having failed to file an answer, Guanzon was declared in default in an Order dated 12 July 1996.\n\nAlmost two years later, defendant Guanzon argued through a Motion to Dismiss [6] dated 9 July 1998 that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over her person by reason of defective service of summons.\n\nThe Motion to Dismiss was denied by the MeTC in an Order dated 7 August 1998. [7] Guanzon filed a Motion for Reconsideration [8] which the MeTC denied in the Order dated 5 October 1998. [9]\n\nAfter hearing, the MeTC in its judgment [10] dated 12 April 1999, held:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff, ordering defendants Francisca Maidin, Reynaldo Lebita, and Erlinda Guanzon, to pay, jointly and severally, the following amount:\nTWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THREE PESOS AND TEN CENTAVOS (P2,103.10) as actual medical expenses;\n\nSIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY PESOS (P6,960.00) as loss of earning capacity for the two remaining months of the plaintiff's contract;\n\nFOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN PESOS (P415.00) as litigation expenses;\n\nTHIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P30,000.00) as moral damages.\nOn defendant Francisca Maidin, Erlinda Lebita, and Reynaldo Lebita's cross-claim against defendant Erlinda Guanzon, answering defendants can recover from Erlinda Guanzon the amount they will pay to the plaintiff. [11] Defendant Guanzon appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila. [12] In a Decision [13] of the RTC dated 9 August 1999, it affirmed the decision of the MeTC. [14]\n\nFrom the decision of the RTC, defendant Erlinda Guanzon filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals [15] on the single issue of the correctness of service of summons on her person. In a Decision [16] of the Court of Appeals dated 30 August 2002, the petition of defendant Guanzon was denied and dismissed.\n\nDefendant Guanzon is now before this Court on Petition for Review on Certiorari submitting the same issue that:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT GIVING DUE COURSE TO AND IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR REVIEW DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SHERIFF'S RETURN CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE SUBSTITUTED SERVICE OF SUMMONS ON THE PETITIONER WAS DEFECTIVE AND PRODUCED NO EFFECT OTHER THAN NULLITY OF THE PROCEEDING. [17] We deny the Petition.\n\nRecords clearly show that defendant Guanzon was declared in default by the MeTC on 12 July 1996 for failure to file an Answer within the reglementary period. [18]\n\nFirst off, in Cerezo v. Tuazon , [19] the Court reiterated the remedies available to a party declared in default:\na) The defendant in default may, at any time after discovery thereof and before judgment, file a motion under oath to set aside the order of default on the ground that his failure to answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence, and that he has a meritorious defense (Sec. 3, Rule 18 [now Sec. 3(b), Rule 9]);\n\nb) If the judgment has already been rendered when the defendant discovered the default, but before the same has become final and executory, he may file a motion for new trial under Section 1(a) of Rule 37;\n\nc) If the defendant discovered the default after the judgment has become final and executory, he may file a petition for relief under Section 2 [now Section 1] of Rule 38; and\n\nd) He may also appeal from the judgment rendered against him as contrary to the evidence or to the law, even if no petition to set aside the order of default has been presented by him (Sec. 2, Rule 41). Moreover, a Petition for Certiorari to declare the nullity of a judgment by default is also available if the trial court improperly declared a party in default, or even if the trial court properly declared a party in default, if grave abuse of discretion attended such declaration. [20]\n\nInstead of resorting to the above remedies, defendant Guanzon filed on 9 July 1998 or almost two years after having been declared in default, a Motion to Dismiss the complaint predicated on defective service of summons.\n\nIn any event, we rule that there was proper service of summons on defendant Guanzon and that the court a quo properly took cognizance of the case.\n\nIt appears that a document from the Land Transportation Commission reveals that the motor vehicle registration of the Isuzu dump truck then driven by Escarilla is under the name of Erlinda A. Guanzon as owner with address at 22 Sapocoy St., Bo. Manresa, Quezon City. Thus, summons was first attempted to be served personally on Guanzon at such address. [21] However, the attempt failed for the reason that she was unknown at said address.\n\nThereafter, further inquiry was made on Guanzon's real address. A General Information Sheet obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shows that Erlinda Guanzon, director of Guanzon Lime Development Company, Inc., is a resident of 478 Rizal Ave. Ext., Caloocan City. Hence, summons was effected by way of substituted service. Apparently, Guanzon was not in the premises at that time, so the service was made on a certain Susan Ador, of suitable age, and working within the premises.\n\nThe Sheriff's Return reads:\nThe undersigned sheriff respectfully states:\n\nThat the Summons together with the copy of Complaint and Annexes issued in the above-entitled case was served in the following manner to wit:\n\nDefendant Erlinda Guanzon of 478 Rizal Avenue Ext., Kalookan City, was served with copies of Complaint/Annexes/Summons on June 13, 1996 by substituted service thru Susan Ador, who is of suitable age, presently employed where defendant Erlinda Guanzon is also working, affixed her signature as evidenced (sic) for the receipt thereof.\n\nDefendant Ruel D. Escarilla of the given address was not served with the copy of Summons with Complaint with Annexes for reason that he is no longer connected with the firm.\n\nSeveral attempts were being made by the undersigned to serve the Summons to both defendants personally but to no avail, hence the same was served by substituted services pursuant of Sec. 8 (a) and (b) Rule 14, Rules of Court in the Phil. [22] We find that the service of summons upon the petitioner, first attempted by personal service, and subsequently by substituted service, more than meets the requirement set by the Rules of Court and the due process clause.\n\nSummons is the writ by which the defendant is notified of the action brought against him. Service of such writ is the means by which the court may acquire jurisdiction over his person. [23] As a rule, summons should be personally served on the defendant. It is only when summons cannot be served personally within a reasonable period of time that substituted service may be resorted to.\n\nSecs. 6 and 7, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, provides:\nSEC. 6. Service in person on defendant. \u2013 Whenever practicable, the summons shall be served by handing a copy thereof to the defendant in person, or, if he refuses to receive and sign for it, by tendering it to him.\n\nSEC. 7. Substituted service. \u2013 If, for justifiable causes, the defendant cannot be served within a reasonable time as provided in the preceding section, service may be effected (a) by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or (b) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular place of business with some competent person in charge thereof. The rules specify two modes for effecting substituted service of summons, to wit:\na) by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or\n\nb) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular place of business with some competent person in charge thereof. [24] The certificate of service of the process server of the court a quo is prima facie evidence of the facts as set out therein. [25] This is fortified by the presumption of the regularity of performance of official duty. To overcome the presumption of regularity of official functions in favor of such sheriff's return, the evidence against it must be clear and convincing. Sans the requisite quantum of proof to the contrary, the presumption stands deserving of faith and credit.\n\nSubstituted service is valid service expressly authorized by the Rules. It is allowed when the defendant cannot be served personally within a reasonable time, in which event, service may be effected by leaving copies of the summons at defendant's dwelling house or residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or at his office or regular place of business with some competent person in charge thereof . It is not necessary that the person in charge of the defendant's regular place of business be specifically authorized to receive the summons. It is enough that he appears to be in charge. [26]\n\nThe constitutional requirement of due process exacts that the service be such as may be reasonably expected to give the notice desired. Once the service provided by the rules reasonably accomplishes that end, the requirement of justice is answered; the traditional notions of fair play are satisfied and due process is served. [27]\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 30 August 2002 affirming the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 30, dated 9 August 1999 and the Decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 13, dated 12 April 1999 is AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J.

ENRIQUE SUPLICO, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore us is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated February 24, 2000 in CA-G.R. CV No. 56210, which affirmed in toto the Decision [2] dated July 5, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City, Branch 268, in Civil Case No. 47543; and the CA Resolution [3] dated August 7, 2000 which denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe present petition arose from a complaint for annulment of title with prayer for preliminary injunction filed with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, docketed as Civil Case No. 47543, by Rosalina Gurrea (plaintiff) in her capacity as attorney-in-fact of the heirs of Ricardo Gurrea (Ricardo), namely: Natividad, Carlos, Juliet and Ricardo, Jr., all surnamed Gurrea, and Teresa Gurrea Colemenares. [4] The complaint was filed against Atty. Enrique Suplico (defendant), Gen. Gaudencio Tobias, in his capacity as General Manager of the National Housing Authority, and Joseph Estrada, in his capacity as Municipal Mayor of San Juan, Rizal. [5]\n\nThe CA adopted the facts of the case as summarized by the RTC, to wit:\n\nThe lot in question situated at 245 Marne Street, San Juan, Metro Manila was originally owned by one of herein plaintiffs' Attorney-in-Fact, Rosalina Gurrea, as evidence (sic) by TCT No. 49767 (Exhibit \"A\"). That sometime in 1958, Rosalina Gurrea transferred the ownership of said lot to Adelina Gurrea, whose ownership was evidenced by TCT No. 58253 (Exhibit \"B\"). That Adelina Gurrea continued to be the owner of the lot until her death. Thereafter, Special Proceedings No. 7185 was instituted to have the will she executed during her lifetime probated and to settle her estate. Under the said will, the San Juan lot was bequeathed to Pilar and Luis Gurrea, while 700,000 pesetas, - of the lot in Baguio City and a one-hectare piece of land in Pontevedra, Negros Occidental were given to Ricardo Gurrea.\n\nRicardo Gurrea, represented by and through his counsel Atty. Enrique Suplico (the defendant), filed an Opposition in Special Proc. No. 7185. In consideration of said representation, Ricardo Gurrea agreed to pay Atty. Suplico \"a contingent fee of twenty (20%) of whatever is due me, either real or personal property\" (Exhibit \"5\"). During the pendency of the proceedings and upon the oral instructions of Ricardo Gurrea, Atty. Suplico negotiated with the other heirs of Adelina Gurrea regarding the transfer of the piso (apartment building) in Spain to Ricardo Gurrea's daughter, Juliet Gurrea de Melendres. Ricardo Gurrea further instructed Atty. Suplico not to enter into any settlement with the heirs unless the piso is transferred to his daughter. Finally, the transfer of the piso worth P64,000.00 was executed and the heirs arrived at an amicable settlement regarding the estate of Adelina Gurrea. Hence, Ricardo Gurrea withdrew his Opposition and the heirs then drew up a project of partition which was eventually approved by the probate court. Pursuant to the project of partition, the following properties were adjudicated to Ricardo Gurrea: (1) the whole of the Baguio lot (with assessed value of P26,350.00); (2) the whole of the San Juan lot (with assessed value of P9,630.00); and (3) a parcel of land in Pontevedra, Negros Occidental (with assessed value of P300.00). (Exhibit \"R\" for plaintiff and exhibit \"19\" for defendant).\n\nAs payment of his attorney's fees, Ricardo Gurrea offered the San Juan lot to Atty. Suplico who was initially hesitant to accept the same as the property is occupied by squatters. However, in order not to antagonize his client, Atty. Suplico agreed to Ricardo Gurrea's proposal with the further understanding that he will receive an additional commission of 5% if he sells the Baguio property. Thereafter, the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest was drafted. The said deed was presented to Ricardo Gurrea for his signature. That before signing the same, the contents of the deed were first explained to Ricardo Gurrea by Atty. Suplico and Atty. Manuel Pama, the notary public. On August 20, 1975, the deed was finally signed by Ricardo Gurrea at the office of Atty. Pama, in the presence of the latter, Atty. Suplico, Victor Tupas and another person, the last two acting as witnesses. Later, on October 7, 1980, Atty. Suplico registered the deed and obtained a title/TCT to the San Juan property under his name. Ricardo Gurrea died on October 22, 1980. After his death, his heirs instituted Special Pro. No. 2722 for the settlement of Ricardo Gurrea's estate. In the said proceedings, Atty. Suplico filed several claims for unpaid attorney's fees (no claim was filed relative to Special Proc. No. 7185); however, all were dismissed with finality (Exhibits \"I\" and \"J\"). Also in the same case, the estate's administrator, Carlos Gurrea, filed an Inventory of Properties left by the decedent, which did not initially include the property subject of this case. The said lot was included only subsequently in the Amended Inventory (Exhibit \"G\"). [6]\n\nOn July 11, 1985, the RTC issued an Order dismissing the complaint on the ground that it does not state a cause of action because the plaintiff is not the real party-in-interest. [7] The complaint-in-intervention was likewise dismissed. Plaintiff filed an appeal with the CA questioning the July 11, 1985 Order of the RTC. [8] The case was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 14790.\n\nThereafter, defendant filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution Pending Appeal. [9] In its Order dated May 20, 1986, the RTC granted defendant's motion. [10] Plaintiff then filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with the CA seeking to annul the trial court's Order of May 20, 1986. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 09394.\n\nSubsequently, CA-G.R. CV No. 14790 and CA-G.R. SP No. 09394 were consolidated.\n\nOn November 21, 1989, the CA promulgated its Decision in the consolidated cases, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, as follows:\n\n(1) REVERSING the order appealed from in CA-G.R. CV No. 14790 and GRANTING the appellant Rosalina Gurrea a period of sixty (60) days from finality of this decision within which to implead in Civil Case No. 47543 the real parties-in-interest; after compliance herewith by the appellant, the trial court shall proceed to hear and decide the case accordingly; and\n\n(2) GRANTING the petition for certiorari and prohibition in CA-G.R. SP No. 09394, hereby ANNULLING and SETTING ASIDE the respondent Court's order dated May 20, 1986, granting the respondent Enrique Suplico's motion for execution pending appeal (Annex C, petition), and the writ issued pursuant thereto (Annex D, petition).\n\nCosts against the appellee and respondent Enrique Suplico in both cases.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11]\n\nAccordingly, an Amended Complaint was filed in the RTC impleading the heirs of Ricardo as additional plaintiffs, to wit: Natividad Ariaga Vda. de Gurrea, Carlos Gurrea, Julieta Gurrea, Teresa Gurrea-Rodriguez, Ricardo Gurrea, Jr., Ma. Victoria Gurrea Candel and Ramona Gurrea-Montinola. [12] Thereafter, trial ensued.\n\nIn the course of the trial, Gen. Gaudencio Tobias of the NHA and then Mayor Joseph Estrada of San Juan, were dropped as defendants upon motion of plaintiffs and without the objection of defendant.\n\nAfter trial, the RTC rendered judgment the dispositive portion of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, taking all the foregoing into consideration, the Court finds that the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs, hence, orders the DISMISSAL of the above entitled case. No pronouncement as to damages, costs and attorney's fees.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\n\nPlaintiffs and defendant appealed the case to the CA.\n\nPlaintiffs-appellants contended that the RTC erred: in upholding the validity of the supposed contract of attorney's fees between Ricardo and defendant-appellant which provided for the payment of attorney's fees in the form of real property because such an agreement is prohibited by Article 1491 of the Civil Code; in limiting its evaluation of the transfer of rights and interests in defendant-appelant's favor only on the basis of whether the deed evidencing said transfer of rights and interests was forged, without regard to the facts and circumstances surrounding its execution; in not finding that defendant-appellant has been fully paid for all the services he had rendered for Ricardo; in not declaring the payment of the subject lot as attorney's fees to be unconscionable based on the guidelines for determining attorney's fees.\n\nOn the other hand, defendant-appellant asserted that the RTC erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint for lack of cause of action; and in refusing to award counterclaim in his favor.\n\nOn February 24, 2000, the CA rendered its Decision affirming, in toto, the judgment of the RTC. The CA maintained the lower court's ruling that the plaintiffs-appellants failed to present clear and convincing evidence that defendant-appellant defrauded and exerted undue influence on Ricardo in the latter's execution of the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest and in consequently transferring his ownership of the San Juan lot in his (defendant-appellant's) favor; and that based on the evidence, the San Juan lot may be considered as reasonable attorney's fees for defendant-appellant.\n\nHowever, the CA did not discuss the issue of whether the contract of attorney's fees between the late Ricardo and defendant-appellant and the consequent transfer of rights and interest in favor of the latter is invalid for being violative of Article 1491 of the Civil Code.\n\nPlaintiffs-appellants (hereinafter petitioners), with the exception of plaintiff-appellant Rosalina Gurrea, who died on June 2, 1999, filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the CA denied the same in a Resolution issued on August 7, 2000.\n\nHence, the present petition raising the following issues:\nWHETHER OR NOT, ASSUMING WITHOUT ADMITTING, THAT THE \"TRANSFER OF RIGHTS AND INTERESTS\" (EXHIBIT E; 1) WAS DULY EXECUTED BY RICARDO GURREA, THE SAME VIOLATES ARTICLE 1491 OF THE NEW CIVIL CODE AND, THEREFORE, NULL AND VOID.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE SUPPOSED CONTRACT FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES IN THE FORM OF THE \"MANIFESTATION\" DATED JUNE 24, 1972 (EXHIBIT 5) PROVIDING FOR THE PAYMENT OF ATTORNEY'S FEES OUT OF THE PROPERTIES IN LITIGATION, IS VALID;\n\nWHETHER OR NOT, ASSUMING THAT THE \"MANIFESTATION\" AND \"TRANSFER OF RIGHTS AND INTERESTS\" ARE VALID, AND FURTHER ASSUMING THAT RESPONDENT-ATTORNEY HAS NOT YET BEEN PAID HIS ATTORNEY'S FEES IN SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS NO. 7185, THE PAYMENT OF SAID FEES BY WAY OF THE WHOLE PROPERTY SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INSTANT CASE IS UNCONSCIONABLE OR UNREASONABLE CONSIDERING THE GUIDELINES FOR FIXING ATTORNEY'S FEES;\n\nWHETHER OR NOT PETITIONERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE CANCELLATION OF RESPONDENT ATTORNEY'S TITLE OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AND THE RECONVEYANCE THEREOF TO THE HEREIN PETITIONERS OR TO THE ESTATE OF THE LATE RICARDO GURREA.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT PETITIONERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE DAMAGES CLAIMED IN THE ACTION SUBSTANTIATED BY THEIR EVIDENCE. [14]\nAs to the first issue, petitioners argue on the premise that, under the law, estate proceedings shall be deemed closed and terminated when the court declares it to be so and only after delivery of the remaining estate to the heirs entitled to receive the same. Petitioners contend that no evidence was presented to show that the probate court issued an order declaring Special Proceedings No. 7185 closed and terminated. In addition, when the Transfer of Rights and Interest in favor of respondent was notarized on August 20, 1975, the title over the subject lot was still in the name of Adelina Gurrea and that said title was transferred only in the name of Ricardo on October 7, 1980. On these bases, petitioners conclude that at the time the Transfer of Rights and Interest was notarized, there is no dispute that the subject property still formed part of the estate of Adelina Gurrea and was, therefore, still the subject of litigation. Hence, the transfer of rights and interest over the subject property in favor of Atty. Suplico (respondent) is null and void.\n\nAnent the second issue, petitioners contend that the Manifestation dated June 24, 1972 executed by Ricardo providing for the payment in favor of respondent of a contingent fee of twenty percent (20%) of whatever is due to Ricardo, either real or personal property is invalid because based on jurisprudence, attorney's fees, based on a contingent fee contract, may be paid only out of a certain percentage of the value of the real property in litigation; and that the real property itself may not be given as payment of attorney's fees.\n\nAs to the third issue, petitioners assert that even assuming that the above-mentioned Manifestation and Transfer of Rights and Interest are valid and that respondent had not yet been paid his attorney's fees, the subject property is an unreasonable and unconscionable payment for the actual services that respondent had rendered for Ricardo, taking into consideration the guidelines for fixing attorney's fees.\n\nPetitioners did not elaborate on the fourth issue while, in the fifth issue, they submitted to the discretion of the Court their entitlement to damages and attorney's fees, as claimed before the trial court.\n\nOn his part, respondent contends that the issue as to whether Special Proceedings No. 7185 was already closed and terminated at the time of execution of the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest, involves the determination of factual matters and appreciation of pieces of evidence which cannot be raised in a petition for review on certiorari before this Court. Even assuming that petitioners may properly raise a factual issue in the present petition, respondent submits that there is sufficient evidentiary basis for the trial court's conclusion that the Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed and entered into after the termination of Special Proceedings No. 7185. Respondent also contends that based on jurisprudence, the Court has upheld the validity of contingency fee contracts providing for the payment of attorney's fees out of a portion or part of the property subject of litigation; that the subject property is just, reasonable and equitable payment for the services he rendered for the late Ricardo, consisting of the signing of the Project of Partition, filing of an Opposition during the estate proceedings, and negotiating with the other heirs which resulted in Ricardo's recovery of three parcels of land.\n\nThe Court finds the petition meritorious.\n\nIt is a fundamental rule that the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari as a mode of appeal under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, such as the one at bar, is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact. [15] The rationale of this rule is founded on the fact that the Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the re-examination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during the trial of the case considering that the findings of facts of the CA are conclusive and binding on the Court. [16]\n\nHowever, there are recognized exceptions to this rule, to wit:\n\n(1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the CA went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, could justify a different conclusion. [17]\n\nThe Court finds the present case falling under the second exception for reasons discussed hereunder.\n\nAt the outset, it should be stressed that the question as to whether the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest was forged was resolved by the CA when it affirmed the ruling of the RTC that herein petitioners failed to present clear, convincing and satisfactory evidence that respondent defrauded Ricardo. The CA also ruled that there is no evidence on record to show that the signature of the late Ricardo on the questioned deed is simulated or false. This matter is not assailed in the present petition.\n\nHowever, despite having been specifically assigned as an error by petitioners in their appellant's brief filed with the CA, the appellate court failed to rule on the question of whether the subject Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed even before the estate proceedings were closed and terminated.\n\nAnent the first issue, it is necessary to resolve whether the subject property was still the object of litigation at the time the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest in favor of respondent was executed; and if so, whether the same should be considered null and void for being violative of the provisions of Article 1491 of the Civil Code.\n\nArticle 1491(5) of the Civil Code provides:\n\n1491. The following persons cannot acquire by purchase, even at a public or judicial auction, either in person or through the mediation of another:\n\n. . .\n\n(5) Justices, judges, prosecuting attorneys, clerks of superior and inferior courts, and other officers and employees connected with the administration of justice, the property and rights in litigation or levied upon an execution before the court within whose jurisdiction or territory they exercise their respective functions; t his prohibition includes the act of acquiring by assignment and shall apply to lawyers, with respect to the property and rights which may be the object of any litigation in which they may take part by virtue of their profession.\n\n. . . (emphasis supplied)\n\nIn its Decision, the RTC made the following disquisition:\n\n[A]ccording to the evidence for the defendant, a Motion for Termination of Proceeding and Discharge of the Executor and Bond dated June 20, 1975 was filed in the case, alleging in paragraphs 3 and 5 thereof, that the executor Angel E. Ordo\u00f1ez has already turned over to the respective heirs and devisees all their respective shares in accordance with the Project of Partition duly approved by the Court. Thereafter, more than one month from the filing thereof, the Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed on August 20, 1975. Hence, at the time of the execution of the questioned document, it may be concluded that Special Proceedings No. 7185 had been terminated. The property in San Juan is no longer the subject of a litigation and may be alienated by the client to his lawyer as payment of attorney's fees rendered. (emphasis supplied)\n\nIt is clear from the above-quoted ruling of the trial court that its sole basis in concluding that Special Proceedings No. 7185 had been terminated and that the subject property is no longer the object of litigation at the time the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed on August 20, 1975 is the allegation of the executor, Angel E. Ordo\u00f1ez, in his Motion [18] for Termination of Proceeding and Discharge of the Executor and Bond dated June 20, 1975, that he had already turned over to the respective heirs and devisees all their respective shares in accordance with the project of partition duly approved by the probate court.\n\nThe Court finds the trial court's inference to be without sufficient basis. How can the trial court conclude that Special Proceedings No. 7185 had been terminated and the subject property no longer the object of litigation when no evidence was presented to show that when the Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed, the probate court had already issued an order declaring the estate proceedings closed and terminated? A thing is said to be in litigation not only if there is some contest or litigation over it in court, but also from the moment that it becomes subject to the judicial action of the judge. [19] In the present case, there is no proof to show that at the time the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed, the probate court had issued an order granting the Motion for Termination of Proceeding and Discharge of the Executor and Bond. Since the judge has yet to act on the above-mentioned motion, it follows that the subject property which is the subject matter of the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest, is still the object of litigation, that is Special Proceedings No. 7185.\n\nFurthermore, we agree with the petitioners' undisputed contention that when the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed, the title over the subject lot was still in the name of Adelina Gurrea and that it was only on October 7, 1980 that the title was transferred in the name of Ricardo. The rule is that as long as the order for the distribution of the estate has not been complied with, the probate proceedings cannot be deemed closed and terminated. [20] The probate court loses jurisdiction of an estate under administration only after the payment of all the debts and the remaining estate delivered to the heirs entitled to receive the same. [21] In the present case, while the subject lot was assigned as Ricardo's share in the project of partition executed by the heirs of Adelina Gurrea, the title over the subject lot was still in the name of the latter and was not yet conveyed to Ricardo when the Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed. As correctly cited by petitioners, the Court held in Lucero v. Ba\u00f1aga [22] that:\n\n[t]he term \"delivery\" or tradition has two aspects: (1) the de jure delivery or the execution of deeds of conveyance and (2) the delivery of the material possession (Florendo vs. Foz, 20 Phil. 388, 393). The usual practice is that, if the land to be delivered is in the name of the decedent, the administrator executes a deed, conveying the land to the distributee. That deed, together with the project of partition, the order approving it, the letters of administration and the certification as to the payment of the estate, inheritance and realty taxes, is registered in the corresponding Registry of Deeds. Title would then be issued to the distributee. Thereafter, the administrator or executor places him in material possession of the land if the same is in the custody of the former. [23]\n\nIt follows that, since at the time of execution of the deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest, the subject property still formed part of the estate of Adelina, and there being no evidence to show that material possession of the property was given to Ricardo, the probate proceedings concerning Adelina's estate cannot be deemed to have been closed and terminated and the subject property still the object of litigation.\n\nHaving been established that the subject property was still the object of litigation at the time the subject deed of Transfer of Rights and Interest was executed, the assignment of rights and interest over the subject property in favor of respondent is null and void for being violative of the provisions of Article 1491 of the Civil Code which expressly prohibits lawyers from acquiring property or rights which may be the object of any litigation in which they may take part by virtue of their profession.\n\nArticle 1409 of the same Code provides, among others, that contracts which are expressly prohibited or declared void by law are considered inexistent and void from the beginning.\n\nAnent the second issue, the Court has already held that the said property is still the object of litigation at the time the subject Manifestation and Transfer of Rights and Interest were executed and, thus, may not be acquired by respondent pursuant to the provisions of Article 1491 of the Civil Code.\n\nConsidering that the subject Transfer of Rights and Interest is null and void, the Court no longer finds it necessary to resolve the third issue.\n\nAs to the fourth issue, it follows that respondent's title over the subject property should be cancelled and the property reconveyed to the estate of Ricardo, the same to be distributed to the latter's heirs. This is without prejudice, however, to respondent's right to claim his attorney's fees from the estate of Ricardo, it being undisputed that he rendered legal services for the latter.\n\nAnent the last issue, the Court is not persuaded by petitioners' prayer for the grant of attorney's fees in an amount as the Court may determine. The general rule is that attorney's fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. [24] Article 2208 of the Civil Code provides that in the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:\n\n(1) When exemplary damages are awarded;\n\n(2) When the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest;\n\n(3) In criminal cases of malicious prosecution against the plaintiff;\n\n(4) In case of a clearly unfounded civil action or proceeding against the plaintiff;\n\n(5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable claim;\n\n(6) In actions for legal support;\n\n(7) In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;\n\n(8) In actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws;\n\n(9) In a separate civil action to recover civil liability arising from a crime;\n\n(10) When at least double judicial costs are awarded;\n\n(11) In any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.\n\nThe Court finds that the present case does not fall under any of the enumerated exceptions. It is settled that even if a claimant is compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect its rights, still attorney's fees may not be awarded where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party's persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of his cause. [25] In the present case, even granting that petitioners were compelled to litigate and incur expenses to protect their interests, attorney's fees may not be awarded in their favor because there is no sufficient showing that respondent acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy their claim, in view of his erroneous belief and judgment that he has lawfully acquired the subject property.\n\nAs to petitioners' entitlement to other forms of damages, while the complaint filed by herein petitioners with the trial court contains a general prayer for the grant of other reliefs, the rule is that evidence should be taken of the damages claimed and the court should determine who are the persons entitled to such indemnity. [26] The power of the courts to grant damages and attorney's fees demands factual, legal and equitable justification; its basis cannot be left to speculation or conjecture. [27] In the present case, no allegation, much less, evidence was presented by petitioners to prove that they are entitled to damages.\n\nWHEREFORE, the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. CV No. 56210 together with the Decision dated July 5, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 268 in Civil Case No. 47543 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE .

SALAZAR PETITIONER, VS PHILIPPINE DUPLICATORS, INC., AND /OR LEONORA FONTANILLA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nVELASCO, JR., J.:\n\nTruth lives on in the midst of deception .\n\u2013Friedrich von Schiller\n\nThe Case\n\nThis petition for review seeks the reversal of the March 15, 2002 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 62556, entitled Estrellita G. Salazar v. National Labor Relations Commission, Philippine Duplicators, Inc. and/or Leonora Fontanilla, which declared petitioner Salazar's dismissal from employment lawful and valid, but nevertheless ordered respondent Philippine Duplicators, Inc. liable for separation pay equal to one month's salary for every year of service and likewise assails the August 7, 2002 Resolution denying her Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe Facts\n\nPetitioner Estrellita Salazar became Sales Representative of respondent company, Philippine Duplicators, Inc. (\"Duplicators\" for brevity), on May 1, 1987. She was assigned at the Southern Section of Metro Manila under the direct supervision of respondent Leonora Fontanilla. Petitioner received her last compensation in the amount of PhP 14,095.73 which covered her basic salary and monthly commission. [1]\n\nOn November 23, 1998, respondent Fontanilla went over the three (3) accounts of Salazar, namely, ICLARM, Bengson Law Office, and D.M. Consunji, Inc. The individual ledgers specified that Salazar visited the said customers; that she talked with the contact persons identified in the ledgers; and that she reported that these customers would not, in the meantime, purchase the equipment because of budgetary constraints. [2]\n\nDuring the last week of November 1998, respondent Fontanilla asked Salazar whether she went to the aforementioned clients on November 20, 1998. The latter answered in the affirmative as reflected in her Daily Sales Report (DSR) given to Fontanilla. However, respondent Fontanilla told Salazar that upon verification, the said clients alleged that they neither knew nor met the latter; but Salazar stood firm on her declaration that on the said date, she met all three (3) customers.\n\nPetitioner claimed that on December 7, 1998, respondent Fontanilla called her to the latter's office and handed her a memorandum with a ball pen requesting her to receive it. Petitioner refused to receive it because it stated her termination from employment and asked Fontanilla why she should be terminated as she had done nothing wrong. [3]\n\nOn December 9, 1998, respondent Fontanilla directed Salazar, through a memorandum [4] to explain, within 72 hours from receipt of said document, why no disciplinary action should be taken against her in violation of Section 8, Category V of the company's Handbook on Constructive Discipline for \"falsifying company records\", but petitioner refused to receive the memorandum. Hence, on December 10, 1998, it was sent through registered mail to Salazar's residence. [5]\n\nSalazar claimed that on December 10, 1998, the union president also gave her a copy of the December 9, 1998 memorandum charging her of falsification; and that the memorandum was just a plan to comply with the procedural due process leading to her termination which had already materialized when the first memorandum of termination was allegedly shown to her on December 7, 1998. Consequently, she did not report to work anymore and readily filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against the respondents on December 15, 1998, docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-12-10174-98.\n\nOn December 16, 1998, through registered mail, Salazar eventually received a copy of the December 9, 1998 memorandum about the charge of falsification.\n\nMeanwhile, respondent company sought the dismissal of Salazar's complaint of illegal dismissal, claiming it was Salazar who abandoned work. Labor Arbiter Eduardo J. Carpio dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of interest to prosecute through his February 23, 1999 Order. [6]\n\nOn March 15, 1999, petitioner received the March 8, 1999 memorandum [7] which charged her with abandonment of work since December 15, 1998 in violation of Section 5, Category V of the Handbook on Constructive Discipline. Petitioner replied through a letter addressed to Mr. Vicente O. Reyes, [8] President of the respondent company, indicating her amazement since the case for illegal dismissal she filed before the NLRC against the respondents was still pending. [9]\n\nOn the other hand, respondents averred that on March 8, 1999, Mr. Eduardo Melendres, Area Sales Manager of respondent Fontanilla, sent a letter of termination addressed to Salazar through registered mail for \"falsifying company records\" punishable under Category V, paragraph 8 of the company handbook. [10]\n\nOn May 31, 1999, Salazar refiled the labor case which was redocketed as NLRC Case No. 00-05-06051-99 and was re-raffled to Labor Arbiter Manuel R. Caday. When there was no settlement arrived at during the conferences, the contending parties were subsequently directed to submit their respective position papers. [11] A copy of the March 8, 1999 termination letter addressed to Salazar was appended as Annex \"F\" to respondents' September 1, 1999 Position Paper. [12]\n\nIn her position paper, Salazar disputed Duplicators' assertion that she abandoned her employment.\n\nWith respect to the March 8, 1999 termination letter dismissing her from employment for \"falsifying company records,\" she insisted that she did not receive said letter. In support of her contention, she averred that the Muntinlupa City Post Office certified that Registry Receipt No. 4299 attached to the letter was assigned to Norma De Guia of Bacon, Sorsogon as addressee. Petitioner believed that said letter could have been concocted to present a semblance of defense for respondents.\n\nDuplicators vehemently denied the alleged fabrication of the March 8, 1999 termination letter and contended that if there had been an error, it was not Duplicators' fault. It stressed the presumed validity of the questioned registry receipt and submitted a certification from the Postmaster of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna which indicated that the mail matter addressed to Salazar was covered by Registry Receipt No. 4295 and was in fact sent to Salazar's residence at Block 3, Lot 12, Phase 36, Pacita Complex, Bi\u00f1an, Laguna.\n\nOn December 8, 1999, Labor Arbiter Manuel R. Caday rendered his Decision finding that petitioner's dismissal was for a just cause, but respondent Duplicators breached the twin-notice requirement for dismissal under Section 2 (c), Rule XXIII, Book V of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code. Thus, Duplicators was ordered to pay an indemnity of PhP 10,000.00 to petitioner Salazar.\n\nThe decretal portion reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the respondent company to pay complainant the amount of P10,000.00 by way of indemnity. x x x\n\nAll other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\nOn January 26, 2000, Salazar filed a Memorandum of Appeal [14] from the adverse Decision. On August 28, 2000, the NLRC decided the appeal finding that there was actually no termination of Salazar's employment but considering that reinstatement was not advisable due to the strained relationship between the parties, separation pay was ordered paid to petitioner in lieu of reinstatement. The fallo of the August 28, 2000 Decision [15] reads:\nWHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED to the extent that the respondent company is hereby ordered to pay the complainant Php14,095.73 representing her one month separation pay. The award of indemnity is hereby deleted. The other findings stand Affirmed.\nIn its October 25, 2000 Resolution, [16] Salazar's October 12, 2000 Motion for Reconsideration [17] was subsequently denied for lack of merit.\n\nBelieving in the merits of her complaint, Salazar filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA on January 11, 2001, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 62556.\n\nIn its March 15, 2002 Decision, [18] the CA ruled this way:\nWHEREFORE, on the basis of the dissertations that prescind, the assailed issuances rendered by the NLRC are hereby AFFIRMED with modification. The dismissal of the petitioner is perforce declared lawful and valid. Nonetheless, as a measure of compassion and social justice, she is hereby pronounced entitled to separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service rendered.\nSimply stated, the CA ruled that the termination of Salazar's employment was legal and valid. While the dismissed employee was not entitled to separation pay, the CA nonetheless awarded severance pay pursuant to settled jurisprudence and in the interest of social justice. Lastly, it ruled that there was no breach of the due process requirements prescribed for dismissal from employment.\n\nOn April 3, 2002, Salazar filed a Motion for Reconsideration, [19] but the CA consequently denied said motion in its August 7, 2002 Resolution. [20]\n\nHence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari is before us.\n\nThe Issues\nPetitioner interposed the following issues:\nON THE PRESUMPTION THAT PETITIONER WAS DISMISSED WITH JUST CAUSE, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ALLOWED THE REVERSAL BY ERROR BY THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC) OF THE LABOR ARBITER'S FINDING/RULING THAT SHE WAS DISMISSED IN VIOLATION OF THE PROCEDURAL ASPECT OF DISMISSAL TO FAVOR RESPONDENTS WHO DID NOT APPEAL.\n\nON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A REVIEW OF THE FINDINGS OF THE LABOR ARBITER ON PROCEDURAL ASPECT OF PETITIONER'S DISMISSAL COULD BE MADE, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT SAID THAT PEITIONER WAS SERVED NOTICE OF DISMISSAL BASED ON CERTIFICATION OF THE POST OFFICE OF BI\u00d1AN LAGUNA, REFERRING TO A DIFFERENT MAIL MATTER.\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT DID NOT RULE THAT RESPONDENTS' DEFENSE IN THE ILLEGAL CASE IS ABANDONMENT, WHICH IS UNTENABLE, AND THE ALLEGED SUBSEQUENT DISMISSAL IS BUT AN AFTERTHOUGHT.\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHICH IT SUSTAINED THAT PETITIONER WAS DISMISSED WITH JUST CAUSE IN DISREGARD OF THE SETTLED JURISPRUDENCE ON THE MATTER. [21]\nPetition Salazar claims that the NLRC should not have deleted the award of indemnity of PhP 10,000.00 in her favor since both Duplicators and Fontanilla did not interpose any appeal from the Decision of Labor Arbiter Manuel Caday and hence, no affirmative relief could be granted to said respondents.\n\nThis postulation is incorrect.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nAs a general rule, \"a party who has not appealed cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the appealed decision.\" [22]\n\nThe reason for this rule is that since parties did not appeal from the decision or resolution, they are presumed to be satisfied with the adjudication. Furthermore, Rule 141 on Legal Fees provides that if the fee is not paid, then \"the court may refuse to proceed with the action until they are paid and may dismiss the appeal or the action or proceeding.\" The case or appeal is deemed filed only upon payment of the docket or appeal fee considering that jurisdiction is acquired by the court over the case or the appeal only upon full payment of the prescribed fee. Thus, the court has no jurisdiction or authority to grant affirmative relief to the party who did not appeal as there is no obligation to pay any fee. Furthermore, in the interest of fairness, it would not be proper and just to award affirmative relief to the appellees since they did not comply with the requirements of appeal. In this case, Rule VI, Section 3 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure [2000] [23] prescribes the following:\nSection 3. REQUISITES FOR PERFECTION OF APPEAL. a) The Appeal shall be filed within the reglementary period as provided in Section 1 of this Rule; shall be under oath with proof of payment of the required appeal fee and the posting of a cash or surety bond as provided in Section 6 of this Rule; shall be accompanied by memorandum of appeal which shall state the grounds relied upon and the arguments in support thereof; the relief prayed for; and a statement of the date when the appellant received the appealed decision, order or award and proof of service on the other party of such appeal.\nComplying with these specifications is a difficult and tedious process, specifically the posting of cash or surety bond. It would be discriminatory and inequitable if a party who has not complied with these requirements will be granted affirmative relief.\n\nIn the instant case, did the NLRC violate the rule in labor cases that an appellee cannot be awarded any affirmative relief?\n\nWe find no deviation from the doctrine.\n\nThe Labor Arbiter ruled that petitioner Salazar's dismissal was for a just cause but discovered an infraction of the two-notice requirement on the dismissal of an employee for which he ordered Duplicators to pay the indemnity of PhP 10,000.00 to Salazar. However, on petitioner's appeal, the NLRC believed that there was after all no dismissal of petitioner Salazar but due to strained relationship, the company was made to pay separation pay of PhP 14,095.73 instead of paying the indemnity of PhP 10,000.00 imposed by the Labor Arbiter. It is the deletion of the PhP 10,000.00 indemnity that is being assailed by the petitioner as a grant of affirmative relief to respondent Duplicators.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nPetitioner's first ground in her Memorandum of Appeal before the NLRC stated that Labor Arbiter Caday's ruling\u2013that she was not illegally dismissed was \"erroneous.\" [24] In resolving this issue, the NLRC overturned Caday's finding of petitioner's valid dismissal, and instead concluded that there was no termination of petitioner's employment. As a consequence, the NLRC had to recall the award of PhP 10,000.00 indemnity imposed by Arbiter Caday although not prayed for by respondent Duplicators since the said award was inconsistent with the finding that petitioner's employment subsisted. Without petitioner's dismissal, there can be no legal basis for the indemnity; hence, Duplicators is not obliged to comply with the two (2)\u2013notice requirement. In annulling the award, the NLRC merely exercised its authority under Article 218 (d) of the Labor Code to correct or amend any error committed by a labor arbiter in aid of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction. Petitioner has no reason to complain that she was deprived of monetary benefits since the NLRC's Decision did not actually benefit Duplicators as the PhP 14,095.76 separation pay granted to petitioner is certainly greater than the PhP 10,000.00 indemnity deleted by the NLRC.\n\nAnent the second issue, petitioner claims that the CA committed reversible error when it concluded that she was served with the dismissal notice based on a post office certification that referred to a different mail matter.\n\nIt is clear that petitioner raised a question of fact which is not allowed by the factual issue bar rule under Rule 45 considering that this Court is not a trier of facts.\n\nGranting arguendo that the issue at bar is an exception to the proscription against questions of fact, we find that the CA did not commit any serious misstep in ruling that petitioner Salazar was actually served with the dismissal notice. The CA explained its conclusion this way:\nProof exists to establish that the foregoing notice of termination was served upon the petitioner by registered mail. The Postmaster of [Bi\u00f1an], Laguna Mr. Fermin De Villa himself certified that this mail matter was delivered to the petitioner in her residence in Bi\u00f1an, Laguna and was received by a C.M. de Vera on March 23, 1999. [25]\nIn her petition, Salazar does not assail the veracity and accuracy of Fermin De Villa's certification that Mail Matter No. 4295 was received by C.M. de Vera on behalf of petitioner. On the other hand, she claims that Mail Matter No. 4295 does not refer to the alleged March 8, 1999 letter of termination based on \"falsification of company records\" but to another Duplicators' letter also dated March 8, 1999 signed by Duplicator Sales Supervisor Leonora A. Fontanilla charging petitioner of abandonment of work.\n\nTo support her contention, petitioner presented a letter, [26] addressed to Philippine Duplicators President Vicente O. Reyes, explaining her side of the abandonment issue. Thus, she questions the CA's reliance on the De Villa certification on the receipt of Mail Matter No. 4295 to refer to the termination letter based on falsification of company records. She explains that \"the alleged termination letter x x x dated March 8, 1999 likewise, was under Mail Matter No. 4299, as shown on the lower portion of the photo copy of the alleged letter of termination itself attached to respondents' Position Paper.\" [27] Based on the Muntinlupa Post Office's Certification, [28] Registry Receipt No. 4299 involves mail matter sent by Ricardo Lipata and addressed to Norma De Sunia of Bacon, Sorsogon. Petitioner therefore concludes that she was not served a copy of the March 8, 1999 termination letter grounded on her alleged falsification of company records because Mail Matter no. 4299 was possibly sent to Norma De Sunia of Bacon, Sorsogon while Mail Matter No. 4295 which petitioner admittedly received, referred to the March 8, 1999 letter for her alleged work abandonment.\n\nTo determine whether the March 8, 1999 termination letter was received by petitioner, we first examine the documentary evidence, viz:\n\n1. The Muntinlupa Post Office Record of Registered Mails reveal the following:\n\na. Registry Receipt No. 4295 was assigned to two (2) mail matters:\n\n1.) Sender: Phil. Duplicators Inc.\n\nAddressee: Estrellita Salazar\n\nSan Pedro, Laguna\n\n2.) Sender: Janet Saduerte\n\nAddressee: Corazon Saduerte\n\nBuli, Camarines Sur [29]\n\nb. Registry Receipt No. 4299\n\nSender: Ricardo Lipata\n\nAddressee: Norma De Sunia\n\nBacon, Sorsogon [30]\n\nc. Certification of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna Postmaster Fermin T. De Villa which states that:\nThis is to certify that registered Letter No.4295 posted at Muntinlupa Post Office on March 16, 1999 and addressed to Ms. Estrellita Salazar of Block 3 Lot 12 Phase 3b, Pacita Complex, Bi\u00f1an, Laguna was delivered to and received by Ms. C.M. de Vera on March 23, 1999. [31]\nd. March 8, 1999 letter of Eduardo Z. Melendres to Estrellita G. Salazar terminating her for \"falsifying company records\" with the Registry Receipt No. 4299 attached thereto at the lower right portion of the letter. [32]\n\nFrom the foregoing pieces of documentary evidence, it appears that there were two (2) mail matters sent by registered mail to petitioner Salazar, namely: one sent to her address at San Pedro, Laguna covered by Registry Receipt No. 4295 as can be seen from a copy of the Record of Registered Mails [33] and another covered by Registry Receipt No. 4295 sent to her address at Block 3 Lot 12 Phase 3b, Pacita Complex, Bi\u00f1an, Laguna which was received by C.M. de Vera per the certification of Bi\u00f1an Postmaster De Villa. Moreover, Registry Receipt No. 4295 was assigned to two (2) mail matters: the first sent by Philippine Duplicators to petitioner and the second sent by Janet Saduerte to Corazon Saduerte. To further complicate the already confusing situation, Registry Receipt No. 4299 was issued to the March 8, 1999 termination letter and at the same time was assigned to the letter sent by Ricardo Lipata to Norma De Sunia.\n\nIn this imbroglio, we rule that petitioner Salazar received the March 8, 1999 termination letter for the following reasons, viz:\n\n1. In its August 28, 2000 Decision, the NLRC ruled that the receipt of the March 8, 1999 letter on termination petitioner's was confirmed based on the certification [34] issued by Postmaster Fermin De Villa.\n\nThe CA upheld this finding by the NLRC when it observed that the \"Postmaster of [Bi\u00f1an] Laguna, Mr. Fermin De Villa himself certified that this mail matter was delivered to the petitioner in her residence in Bi\u00f1an, Laguna and was received by C.M. de Vera on March 23, 1999\". [35]\n\nThe findings of fact of the NLRC are accorded with respect and even finality if based on substantial evidence, and these findings are binding and conclusive upon this Court when passed upon and upheld by the CA. [36]\n\n2. In its Position Paper September 1, 1999 filed in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-05-06051-99 before Labor Arbiter Caday, Duplicators stated that:\nOn March 8, 1999, Mr. Eduardo Z. Melendres, Area Sales Manager of Respondent Leonora Fontanilla issued Private Complaint thru registered mail a letter of termination for falsifying company records punishable under Category V, Paragraph 8 of respondent company's Handbook on Constructive Discipline. A copy of the memorandum is hereto attached as Annex \"F\". [37]\nEven granting arguendo that the post office was not able to deliver the March 8, 1999 termination letter and serve it on petitioner, still it cannot be denied that Salazar in fact got a copy of said termination letter when she received a copy of respondent's Position Paper with the said letter's copy attached Annex \"F.\" It should be noted that neither Article 277 of the Labor Code nor the Omnibus Rules implementing the Labor Code prescribe a time frame within which the termination letter of the employee must be served. Thus, there was compliance with the second required notice on termination of petitioner's.\n\n3. Philippine Duplicators categorically stated that the March 8, 1999 termination latter was assigned Registry Receipt No. 4295 based on the record of Registered Mails although Registry Receipt No. 4299 was inadvertently issued for said mail matter. Registry Receipt No. 4299 was attached to the termination letter appended as Annex \"F\" to respondent's Position Paper. It explained the discrepancy by presenting a copy of the pertinent page in the record that indeed Registry Receipt No. 4295 was assigned to the termination letter while Registry Receipt No. 4299 was actually assigned to the mail sent by Ricardo Lipata to Norma De Sunia of Bacon, Sorsogon. This position was further buttressed by the Bi\u00f1an, Laguna Postmaster Certification that the letter covered by Registry Receipt No. 4295 was actually received by C.M. de Vera for petitioner. Such certification is supported by the presumption that the postmaster's official duty had been regularly performed and in the absence of proof to the contrary, then such presumption stands.\n\nOn the other hand, petitioner claims that what she received was the March 8, 1999 letter from Duplicators requiring her to explain the charge of abandonment and not the alleged March 8, 1999 termination letter, which is just a fabrication, considering that Registry Receipt No. 4299 was assigned to another shipper\u2013Mr. Ricardo Lipata and the addressee is Norma de Sunia. However, other than her bare allegation and conclusion, she was not able to substantiate the same. First of all, she could not explain how the Registry Receipt No. 4295 was assigned to the March 8, 1999 show cause letter on the charge of abandonment considering the registration of the mail with the post office was not done by her but by respondent company. She never claimed that respondent forged or falsified Registry Receipt No. 4299. More importantly, if she actually received the March 8, 1999 letter on the charge of abandonment, then she could have submitted the envelope with the registry receipt number stamped in the envelope which is the post office's practice. Without such clear proof, we are not inclined to accept petitioner's story that she did not receive the March 8, 1999 termination letter sent by registered mail.\n\nPetitioner was terminated for falsification of company records and not abandonment\n\nPetitioner Salazar asseverates that she had already been dismissed from service as of December 7, 1998 allegedly based on a notice of termination issued on that day. She explains that the show cause order charging her with falsification of company records subsequently given to her was a belated attempt to show some semblance of procedural due process preparatory to her removal from employment. Lastly, she postulates that the real cause for her removal is abandonment and not falsification of records.\n\nWe find such contentions without basis.\n\nAt the outset, the instant issue is a factual issue which should not be entertained under Rule 45. Even if we consider said issue, relief is not availing. Petitioner merely relied on her self-serving statements. No clear, convincing, and substantial evidence was adduced to prove and support her version of the controversy.\n\nThe Labor Code and its implementing rules empower the Labor Arbiter to be the trier of facts in labor cases. Much reliance is placed on the findings of facts of the arbiter having had the opportunity to talk to and discuss with the parties and their witnesses the factual matters of the case during the conciliation phase. Moreover, if hearing is conducted, the arbiter is able to know first hand the demeanor and behavior of the witnesses while they are giving their narratives. He has become an expert\u2013over the years in such capacity as arbiter\u2013to weigh, analyze, and calibrate the value and credit that should be assigned to parol evidence.\n\nThe factual conclusions of Labor Arbiter Caday were sustained by the NLRC, which ruled that Salazar's claims could not be said to be of unquestionable veracity. Thus, her claim that her employment was terminated on December 7, 1998 before she was given the December 9,1998 a show cause letter cannot be given much weight. Nary a proof was presented that there was a December 7, 1998 memorandum terminating her for abandonment or falsification. Other than her bare assertion, Salazar was not able to adduce any corroborating testimony or documentary evidence to support her claim. She miserably failed to prove what she alleged.\n\nLastly, the CA also adopted Labor Arbiter Caday's findings as affirmed by the NLRC, that Salazar was not actually dismissed on December 7, 1998 without any evidence to prop up her story. When the factual findings of the trier of facts (Labor Arbiter) have been adopted by both the NLRC and the CA, then such conclusions automatically bind this Court as a matter of course.\n\nPetitioner was afforded due process\n\nThe procedure for terminating an employee is found in Book VI, Rule I, Section 2 (d) of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code:\nStandards of due process: requirements of notice . \u2013 In all cases of termination of employment, the following standards of due process shall be substantially observed:\nFor termination of employment based on just causes as defined in Article 282 of the Code:\n(a) A written notice served on the employee specifying the ground or grounds for termination, and giving to said employee reasonable opportunity within which to explain his side;\n\n(b) A hearing or conference during which the employee concerned, with the assistance of counsel if the employee so desires, is given opportunity to respond to the charge, present his evidence or rebut the evidence presented against him; and\n\n(c) A written notice of termination served on the employee indicating that upon due consideration of all the circumstances, grounds have been established to justify his termination.\n\nIn case of termination, the foregoing notices shall be served on the employee's last known address. The aforelisted requirements have been met, thus:\nPetitioner admitted that on December 10, 1998 she received from the union president a copy of the December 9, 1998 memorandum charging her with falsification under Category V of the company's handbook. [38]\n\nThe second requisite\u2013that a hearing or conference is set to enable the employee to respond to the charge and adduce evidence\u2014is deemed substantially complied with. The CA is correct in its observation that \"instead of utilizing the administrative inquiry as a reasonable avenue to thresh out her claims and defenses, petitioner ignored the same.\" [39]\n\nPetitioner received a copy of the March 8, 1999 termination letter by registered mail which she received on March 23, 1999, or at the latest, on September 1, 1999 when she got a copy of respondent's Position Paper where the letter was appended as Annex \"F.\" [40]\nThus the twin notice requirement that constitutes due process has been satisfied.\n\nPetitioner was dismissed for a just and valid cause\n\nPetitioner was charged with \"falsifying company records.\" On this issue, Labor Arbiter Caday made the following findings, viz:\nA scrutiny of these documentary evidence reveals that on November 20, 1998, at around 3:00 PM complainant Salazar visited Juliet Alvarez of Banco-Filipino-Legal, Paseo de Roxas, Legaspi Village, Makati City (Annex \"A\" and \"A-1\" attached to Respondents' Rejoinder). This belies complainant's claim that she visited the respondent's customer, D.M. Consunji, Inc. on November 20, 1998 at around 3:00P.M. (Annex \"C\" attached to Complainant's Reply). Moreover, Mr. Enrique Patag signed the Certification on December 15, 1998 on the date when complainant (Salazar) was no longer reporting for work and filed a case for illegal dismissal against respondents docketed as NLRC Case No. 00-12-10174-98 which was later ordered dismissed by Labor Arbiter Eduardo Carpio for lack of interest to prosecute. Similarly, the certification issued by Mr. Frederick Sison of the D.M. Consunji, Inc. attesting to complainant's visit on November 20, 1998, at 2:00 p.m. is confuted [sic] by the fact that on November 20, 1998, complainant [Salazar] visited Fely/Federico and Lilian at the Makati Medical Center as appearing in customer ledger of Makati Medical Center. (Annex \"B\" and \"B-1\" attached to Respondent's Rejoinder). With the foregoing observations, complainant's pretensions [are] at once noticeable and [merit] scant consideration. [41]\nThe findings of Arbiter Caday jibe with those of the NLRC, to wit:\nSpecifically, in a report she stated that she made a follow-up with Leny Sambrano of Bengson Law Office on November 20, 1998. However, in her \"Reply\", she admitted that she saw, not Sambrano, who was not around, but his secretary. It appears that [in] the report in question, Sambrano wrote, \"there was no visit last Friday,11/20\" and then affixed [her] signature. In another report, she stated that she made a follow-up with Jun of ICLARM on November 20, 1998, but it appeared that Jun Fedrigon wrote on the same report, which he also signed, that she did not visit his office on the date in question. In a letter dated December 15, 1998, he stated that he had no memory of seeing the complainant on the date in question. [42] x x x\nThe findings of both Arbiter Caday and the NLRC were sustained by the CA, which ruled that \"there is ample proof to bear out that the petitioner knowingly recorded erroneous entries in her Daily Sales Reports.\"\n\nIt is well-settled that the findings of fact of quasi-judicial agencies like the NLRC are accorded not only respect but even finality if the findings are supported by substantial evidence; more so when such findings were affirmed by the CA and such findings are binding and conclusive upon this Court. Thus, we rule that petitioner committed fraud or willful breach of the employer's trust reposed in her under Article 282 of the Labor Code.\n\nThe constitutional policy to provide full protection to labor is not meant to be a sword to oppress employers. The commitment under the fundamental law is that the cause of labor does not prevent us from sustaining the employer when the law is clearly on its side.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED and the March 15, 2002 Decision of the Court of Appeals and the August 7, 2002 Resolution in CA-G.R.

CABILZO, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nBefore this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari , filed by petitioner Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank) seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated 8 March 2002 and its Resolution dated 26 July 2002 affirming the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 13 dated 4 September 1998. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the assailed decision dated September 4, 1998 is AFFIRMED with modifications (sic) that the awards for exemplary damages and attorney's fees are hereby deleted.\nPetitioner Metrobank is a banking institution duly organized and existing as such under Philippine laws. [2]\n\nRespondent Renato D. Cabilzo (Cabilzo) was one of Metrobank's clients who maintained a current account with Metrobank Pasong Tamo Branch. [3]\n\nOn 12 November 1994, Cabilzo issued a Metrobank Check No. 985988, payable to \"CASH\" and postdated on 24 November 1994 in the amount of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) . The check was drawn against Cabilzo's Account with Metrobank Pasong Tamo Branch under Current Account No. 618044873-3 and was paid by Cabilzo to a certain Mr. Marquez, as his sales commission. [4]\n\nSubsequently, the check was presented to Westmont Bank for payment. Westmont Bank, in turn, indorsed the check to Metrobank for appropriate clearing. After the entries thereon were examined, including the availability of funds and the authenticity of the signature of the drawer, Metrobank cleared the check for encashment in accordance with the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC) Rules.\n\nOn 16 November 1994, Cabilzo's representative was at Metrobank Pasong Tamo Branch to make some transaction when he was asked by a bank personnel if Cabilzo had issued a check in the amount of P91,000.00 to which the former replied in the negative. On the afternoon of the same date, Cabilzo himself called Metrobank to reiterate that he did not issue a check in the amount of P91,000.00 and requested that the questioned check be returned to him for verification, to which Metrobank complied. [5]\n\nUpon receipt of the check, Cabilzo discovered that Metrobank Check No. 985988 which he issued on 12 November 1994 in the amount of P1,000.00 was altered to P91,000.00 and the date 24 November 1994 was changed to 14 November 1994 . [6]\n\nHence, Cabilzo demanded that Metrobank re-credit the amount of P91,000.00 to his account. Metrobank, however, refused reasoning that it has to refer the matter first to its Legal Division for appropriate action. Repeated verbal demands followed but Metrobank still failed to re-credit the amount of P91,000.00 to Cabilzo's account. [7]\n\nOn 30 June 1995, Cabilzo, thru counsel, finally sent a letter-demand [8] to Metrobank for the payment of P90,000.00, after deducting the original value of the check in the amount of P1,000.00. Such written demand notwithstanding, Metrobank still failed or refused to comply with its obligation.\n\nConsequently, Cabilzo instituted a civil action for damages against Metrobank before the RTC of Manila, Branch 13. In his Complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 95-75651, Renato D. Cabilzo v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company , Cabilzo prayed that in addition to his claim for reimbursement, actual and moral damages plus costs of the suit be awarded in his favor. [9]\n\nFor its part, Metrobank countered that upon the receipt of the said check through the PCHC on 14 November 1994, it examined the genuineness and the authenticity of the drawer's signature appearing thereon and the technical entries on the check including the amount in figures and in words to determine if there were alterations, erasures, superimpositions or intercalations thereon, but none was noted. After verifying the authenticity and propriety of the aforesaid entries, including the indorsement of the collecting bank located at the dorsal side of the check which stated that, \"all prior indorsements and lack of indorsement guaranteed,\" Metrobank cleared the check. [10]\n\nAnent thereto, Metrobank claimed that as a collecting bank and the last indorser, Westmont Bank should be held liable for the value of the check. Westmont Bank indorsed the check as the an unqualified indorser, by virtue of which it assumed the liability of a general indorser, and thus, among others, warranted that the instrument is genuine and in all respect what it purports to be.\n\nIn addition, Metrobank, in turn, claimed that Cabilzo was partly responsible in leaving spaces on the check, which, made the fraudulent insertion of the amount and figures thereon, possible. On account of his negligence in the preparation and issuance of the check, which according to Metrobank, was the proximate cause of the loss, Cabilzo cannot thereafter claim indemnity by virtue of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\n\nThus, Metrobank demanded from Cabilzo, for payment in the amount of P100,000.00 which represents the cost of litigation and attorney's fees, for allegedly bringing a frivolous and baseless suit. [11]\n\nOn 19 April 1996, Metrobank filed a Third-Party Complaint [12] against Westmont Bank on account of its unqualified indorsement stamped at the dorsal side of the check which the former relied upon in clearing what turned out to be a materially altered check.\n\nSubsequently, a Motion to Dismiss [13] the Third-Party Complaint was then filed by Westmont bank because another case involving the same cause of action was pending before a different court. The said case arose from an action for reimbursement filed by Metrobank before the Arbitration Committee of the PCHC against Westmont Bank, and now the subject of a Petition for Review before the RTC of Manila, Branch 19.\n\nIn an Order [14] dated 4 February 1997, the trial court granted the Motion to Dismiss the Third-Party Complaint on the ground of litis pendentia .\n\nOn 4 September 1998, the RTC rendered a Decision [15] in favor of Cabilzo and thereby ordered Metrobank to pay the sum of P90,000.00, the amount of the check. In stressing the fiduciary nature of the relationship between the bank and its clients and the negligence of the drawee bank in failing to detect an apparent alteration on the check, the trial court ordered for the payment of exemplary damages, attorney's fees and cost of litigation. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering defendant Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company to pay plaintiff Renato Cabilzo the sum of P90,000 with legal interest of 6 percent per annum from November 16, 1994 until payment is made plus P20,000 attorney's fees, exemplary damages of P50,000, and costs of the suit. [16]\nAggrieved, Metrobank appealed the adverse decision to the Court of Appeals reiterating its previous argument that as the last indorser, Westmont Bank shall bear the loss occasioned by the fraudulent alteration of the check. Elaborating, Metrobank maintained that by reason of its unqualified indorsement, Westmont Bank warranted that the check in question is genuine, valid and subsisting and that upon presentment the check shall be accepted according to its tenor.\n\nEven more, Metrobank argued that in clearing the check, it was not remiss in the performance of its duty as the drawee bank, but rather, it exercised the highest degree of diligence in accordance with the generally accepted banking practice. It further insisted that the entries in the check were regular and authentic and alteration could not be determined even upon close examination.\n\nIn a Decision [17] dated 8 March 2002, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the Decision of the court a quo , similarly finding Metrobank liable for the amount of the check, without prejudice, however, to the outcome of the case between Metrobank and Westmont Bank which was pending before another tribunal. The decretal portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the assailed decision dated September 4, 1998 is AFFIRMED with the modifications (sic) that the awards for exemplary damages and attorney's fees are hereby deleted. [18]\nSimilarly ill-fated was Metrobank's Motion for Reconsideration which was also denied by the appellate court in its Resolution [19] issued on 26 July 2002, for lack of merit.\n\nMetrobank now poses before this Court this sole issue:\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING METROBANK, AS DRAWEE BANK, LIABLE FOR THE ALTERATIONS ON THE SUBJECT CHECK BEARING THE AUTHENTIC SIGNATURE OF THE DRAWER THEREOF.\nWe resolve to deny the petition.\n\nAn alteration is said to be material if it changes the effect of the instrument. It means that an unauthorized change in an instrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party. [20] In other words, a material alteration is one which changes the items which are required to be stated under Section 1 of the Negotiable Instruments Law.\n\nSection 1 of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides:\nSection 1. Form of negotiable instruments. - An instrument to be negotiable must conform to the following requirements:\n\n(a) It must be in writing and signed by the maker or drawer;\n\n(b) Must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money;\n\n(c) Must be payable on demand or at a fixed determinable future time;\n\n(d) Must be payable to order or to bearer; and\n\n(e) Where the instrument is addressed to a drawee, he must be named or otherwise indicated therein with reasonable certainty.\nAlso pertinent is the following provision in the Negotiable Instrument Law which states:\nSection 125. What constitutes material alteration. \u2013 Any alteration which changes:\n\n(a) The date;\n\n(b) The sum payable, either for principal or interest;\n\n(c) The time or place of payment;\n\n(d) The number or the relation of the parties;\n\n(e) The medium or currency in which payment is to be made;\n\nOr which adds a place of payment where no place of payment is specified, or any other change or addition which alters the effect of the instrument in any respect is a material alteration.\nIn the case at bar, the check was altered so that the amount was increased from P1,000.00 to P91,000.00 and the date was changed from 24 November 1994 to 14 November 1994 . Apparently, since the entries altered were among those enumerated under Section 1 and 125, namely, the sum of money payable and the date of the check, the instant controversy therefore squarely falls within the purview of material alteration.\n\nNow, having laid the premise that the present petition is a case of material alteration, it is now necessary for us to determine the effect of a materially altered instrument, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder. The following provision of the Negotiable Instrument Law will shed us some light in threshing out this issue:\nSection 124. Alteration of instrument; effect of. \u2013 Where a negotiable instrument is materially altered without the assent of all parties liable thereon, it is avoided , except as against a party who has himself made, authorized, and assented to the alteration and subsequent indorsers .\n\nBut when the instrument has been materially altered and is in the hands of a holder in due course not a party to the alteration, he may enforce the payment thereof according to its original tenor. (Emphasis ours.)\nIndubitably, Cabilzo was not the one who made nor authorized the alteration. Neither did he assent to the alteration by his express or implied acts. There is no showing that he failed to exercise such reasonable degree of diligence required of a prudent man which could have otherwise prevented the loss. As correctly ruled by the appellate court, Cabilzo was never remiss in the preparation and issuance of the check, and there were no indicia of evidence that would prove otherwise. Indeed, Cabilzo placed asterisks before and after the amount in words and figures in order to forewarn the subsequent holders that nothing follows before and after the amount indicated other than the one specified between the asterisks.\n\nThe degree of diligence required of a reasonable man in the exercise of his tasks and the performance of his duties has been faithfully complied with by Cabilzo. In fact, he was wary enough that he filled with asterisks the spaces between and after the amounts, not only those stated in words, but also those in numerical figures, in order to prevent any fraudulent insertion, but unfortunately, the check was still successfully altered, indorsed by the collecting bank, and cleared by the drawee bank, and encashed by the perpetrator of the fraud, to the damage and prejudice of Cabilzo.\n\nVerily, Metrobank cannot lightly impute that Cabilzo was negligent and is therefore prevented from asserting his rights under the doctrine of equitable estoppel when the facts on record are bare of evidence to support such conclusion. The doctrine of equitable estoppel states that when one of the two innocent persons, each guiltless of any intentional or moral wrong, must suffer a loss, it must be borne by the one whose erroneous conduct, either by omission or commission, was the cause of injury. [21] Metrobank's reliance on this dictum , is misplaced. For one, Metrobank's representation that it is an innocent party is flimsy and evidently, misleading. At the same time, Metrobank cannot asseverate that Cabilzo was negligent and this negligence was the proximate cause [22] of the loss in the absence of even a scintilla proof to buttress such claim. Negligence is not presumed but must be proven by the one who alleges it. [23]\n\nUndoubtedly, Cabilzo was an innocent party in this instant controversy. He was just an ordinary businessman who, in order to facilitate his business transactions, entrusted his money with a bank, not knowing that the latter would yield a substantial amount of his deposit to fraud, for which Cabilzo can never be faulted.\n\nWe never fail to stress the remarkable significance of a banking institution to commercial transactions, in particular, and to the country's economy in general. The banking system is an indispensable institution in the modern world and plays a vital role in the economic life of every civilized nation. Whether as mere passive entities for the safekeeping and saving of money or as active instruments of business and commerce, banks have become an ubiquitous presence among the people, who have come to regard them with respect and even gratitude and, most of all, confidence. [24]\n\nThus, even the humble wage-earner does not hesitate to entrust his life's savings to the bank of his choice, knowing that they will be safe in its custody and will even earn some interest for him. The ordinary person, with equal faith, usually maintains a modest checking account for security and convenience in the settling of his monthly bills and the payment of ordinary expenses. As for a businessman like the respondent, the bank is a trusted and active associate that can help in the running of his affairs, not only in the form of loans when needed but more often in the conduct of their day-to-day transactions like the issuance or encashment of checks. [25]\n\nIn every case, the depositor expects the bank to treat his account with the utmost fidelity, whether such account consists only of a few hundred pesos or of millions. The bank must record every single transaction accurately, down to the last centavo, and as promptly as possible. This has to be done if the account is to reflect at any given time the amount of money the depositor can dispose of as he sees fit, confident that the bank will deliver it as and to whomever he directs. [26]\n\nThe point is that as a business affected with public interest and because of the nature of its functions, the bank is under obligation to treat the accounts of its depositors with meticulous care, always having in mind the fiduciary nature of their relationship. The appropriate degree of diligence required of a bank must be a high degree of diligence, if not the utmost diligence. [27]\n\nIn the present case, it is obvious that Metrobank was remiss in that duty and violated that relationship. As observed by the Court of Appeals, there are material alterations on the check that are visible to the naked eye. Thus:\nx x x The number \"1\" in the date is clearly imposed on a white figure in the shape of the number \"2\". The appellant's employees who examined the said check should have likewise been put on guard as to why at the end of the amount in words, i.e. , after the word \"ONLY\", there are 4 asterisks, while at the beginning of the line or before said phrase, there is none, even as 4 asterisks have been placed before and after the word \"CASH\" in the space for payee. In addition, the 4 asterisks before the words \"ONE THOUSAND PESOS ONLY\" have noticeably been erased with typing correction paper, leaving white marks, over which the word \"NINETY\" was superimposed. The same can be said of the numeral \"9\" in the amount \"91,000\", which is superimposed over a whitish mark, obviously an erasure, in lieu of the asterisk which was deleted to insert the said figure. The appellant's employees should have again noticed why only 2 asterisks were placed before the amount in figures, while 3 asterisks were placed after such amount. The word \"NINETY\" is also typed differently and with a lighter ink, when compared with the words \"ONE THOUSAND PESOS ONLY.\" The letters of the word \"NINETY\" are likewise a little bigger when compared with the letters of the words \"ONE THOUSAND PESOS ONLY\". [28]\nSurprisingly, however, Metrobank failed to detect the above alterations which could not escape the attention of even an ordinary person. This negligence was exacerbated by the fact that, as found by the trial court, the check in question was examined by the cash custodian whose functions do not include the examinations of checks indorsed for payment against drawer's accounts. [29] Obviously, the employee allowed by Metrobank to examine the check was not verse and competent to handle such duty. These factual findings of the trial court is conclusive upon this court especially when such findings was affirmed the appellate court. [30]\n\nApropos thereto, we need to reiterate that by the very nature of their work the degree of responsibility, care and trustworthiness expected of their employees and officials is far better than those of ordinary clerks and employees. Banks are expected to exercise the highest degree of diligence in the selection and supervision of their employees. [31]\n\nIn addition, the bank on which the check is drawn, known as the drawee bank, is under strict liability to pay to the order of the payee in accordance with the drawer's instructions as reflected on the face and by the terms of the check. Payment made under materially altered instrument is not payment done in accordance with the instruction of the drawer.\n\nWhen the drawee bank pays a materially altered check, it violates the terms of the check, as well as its duty to charge its client's account only for bona fide disbursements he had made. Since the drawee bank, in the instant case, did not pay according to the original tenor of the instrument, as directed by the drawer, then it has no right to claim reimbursement from the drawer, much less, the right to deduct the erroneous payment it made from the drawer's account which it was expected to treat with utmost fidelity.\n\nMetrobank vigorously asserts that the entries in the check were carefully examined: The date of the instrument, the amount in words and figures, as well as the drawer's signature, which after verification, were found to be proper and authentic and was thus cleared. We are not persuaded. Metrobank's negligence consisted in the omission of that degree of diligence required of a bank owing to the fiduciary nature of its relationship with its client. Article 1173 of the Civil Code provides:\nThe fault or negligence of the obligor consists in the omission of that diligence which is required by the nature of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of the persons, of the time and of the place. x x x.,\nBeyond question, Metrobank failed to comply with the degree required by the nature of its business as provided by law and jurisprudence. If indeed it was not remiss in its obligation, then it would be inconceivable for it not to detect an evident alteration considering its vast knowledge and technical expertise in the intricacies of the banking business. This Court is not completely unaware of banks' practices of employing devices and techniques in order to detect forgeries, insertions, intercalations, superimpositions and alterations in checks and other negotiable instruments so as to safeguard their authenticity and negotiability. Metrobank cannot now feign ignorance nor claim diligence; neither can it point its finger at the collecting bank, in order to evade liability.\n\nMetrobank argues that Westmont Bank, as the collecting bank and the last indorser, shall bear the loss. Without ruling on the matter between the drawee bank and the collecting bank, which is already under the jurisdiction of another tribunal, we find that Metrobank cannot rely on such indorsement, in clearing the questioned check. The corollary liability of such indorsement, if any, is separate and independent from the liability of Metrobank to Cabilzo.\n\nThe reliance made by Metrobank on Westmont Bank's indorsement is clearly inconsistent, if not totally offensive to the dictum that being impressed with public interest, banks should exercise the highest degree of diligence, if not utmost diligence in dealing with the accounts of its own clients. It owes the highest degree fidelity to its clients and should not therefore lightly rely on the judgment of other banks on occasions where its clients money were involve, no matter how small or substantial the amount at stake.\n\nMetrobank's contention that it relied on the strength of collecting bank's indorsement may be merely a lame excuse to evade liability, or may be indeed an actual banking practice. In either case, such act constitutes a deplorable banking practice and could not be allowed by this Court bearing in mind that the confidence of public in general is of paramount importance in banking business.\n\nWhat is even more deplorable is that, having been informed of the alteration, Metrobank did not immediately re-credit the amount that was erroneously debited from Cabilzo's account but permitted a full blown litigation to push through, to the prejudice of its client. Anyway, Metrobank is not left with no recourse for it can still run after the one who made the alteration or with the collecting bank, which it had already done. It bears repeating that the records are bare of evidence to prove that Cabilzo was negligent. We find no justifiable reason therefore why Metrobank did not immediately reimburse his account. Such ineptness comes within the concept of wanton manner contemplated under the Civil Code which warrants the imposition of exemplary damages, \"by way of example or correction for the public good,\" in the words of the law. It is expected that this ruling will serve as a stern warning in order to deter the repetition of similar acts of negligence, lest the confidence of the public in the banking system be further eroded. [32]\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition is DENIED . The Decision dated 8 March 2002 and the Resolution dated 26 July 2002 of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED with modification that exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 be awarded.

(petitioner) with different hiring periods, work designations, and salary rates.\u00a0 Petitioner, however, denied this, alleging that some of the complainants are seasonal employees, some are contractors, others were hired under the pakyaw system, while the rest were hired by the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation, which has a separate and distinct entity from it.\n\nIn a Decision dated September 30, 1998, the Labor Arbiter (LA) held petitioner and its manager, Jose Luis Bondoc, liable for underpayment as complainants were regular employees of petitioner.\u00a0 They were also held guilty of illegal dismissal with regard to complainants Joselito Tinghil and Pedro Emperado.\n\nOn appeal to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), the LA\u2019s Decision was reversed and another one was entered dismissing all the complaints per Decision dated June 30, 2000.\u00a0 It was the NLRC\u2019s finding that the complaint should have been directed against the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation since complainants\u2019 individual affidavits contained the allegations that their tasks pertained to their work \u201cin the golf course.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeals (CA), [1] in turn, vacated and set aside the NLRC\u2019s dismissal in its Decision dated November 26, 2001, and reinstated the LA\u2019s Decision with the modification that the award of wage differentials was limited to the following twenty-two (22) persons, namely: Rolando Baloron, Samuel Garcia, Darwin Garnica, Simeon Panangganan, Pablo Pao, Felix Torres, Manuel Garcia, Paquito Napao, Celso Rufa, Joselito Tinghil, Elpidia Toroy, Ernesto Torres, Laureano Lopez, Joseph Barba, Hermenigildo Ca\u00f1olas, Salome Regala, Guillermo Torres, Narcisa Torres, Nelson Torres, Loreto Ybanay, Luis Guan, and Christopher Ybanay (respondents), while the finding of illegal dismissal with regard to Pedro Emparado and the award of attorney\u2019s fees were deleted.\n\nHence, the present petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court based on the following grounds:\nI\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE, CONTRARY TO THE ADMISSION OF PARTIES AND WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN THE APPRECIATION OF FACTS:\nIn holding petitioner liable for the wage differentials of 22 respondents who themselves admit and allege in their own Affidavits that their employees was another entity \u2013 Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation, and not herein Petitioner Company.\n\nIn affirming that respondent Joselito Tinghil was illegally dismissed by Petitioner, when in fact, Joselito Tinghil, as narrated by him in his own Affidavit, was working with Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation, and not herein Petitioner.\n\nIn even finding that Joselito Tinghil was illegally dismissed in the first place, when there is no evidence to support his allegation. I I\n\nTHE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS HOLDING PETITIONER\u2019S MANAGER PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR CORPORATE ACTS IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW. [2] At the outset, it should be stated that under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised, the reason being that this Court is not a trier of facts, and it is not for this Court to reexamine and reevaluate the evidence on record. [3] Considering, however, that the CA and the Labor Arbiter came up with an opinion different from that of the NLRC, the Court is now constrained to review the evidence on record. [4]\n\nPetitioner contests the CA\u2019s conclusion that the 22 respondents were its employees.\u00a0 Petitioner insists that based on their affidavits, respondents admitted that they were employees of the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation, hence, their complaint for illegal dismissal should have been directed against it.\n\nThe Court disagrees.\u00a0 Petitioner is estopped from denying that respondents worked for it.\u00a0 In the first place, it never raised this defense in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter.\u00a0 Notably, the defense it raised pertained to the nature of respondents\u2019 employment, i.e. , whether they are seasonal employees, contractors, or worked under the pakyaw system.\u00a0 Thus, in its Position Paper, petitioner alleged that some of the respondents are coconut filers and copra hookers or sakadors ; some are seasonal employees who worked as scoopers or lugiteros ; some are contractors; and some worked under the pakyaw system. [5] In support of these allegations, petitioner even presented the company\u2019s payroll, [6] which will allegedly prove its allegations.\n\nBy setting forth these defenses, petitioner, in effect, admitted that respondents worked for it, albeit in different capacities.\u00a0 Such allegations are negative pregnants \u2013 denials pregnant with the admission of the substantial facts in the pleading responded to which are not squarely denied, [7] and amounts to an acknowledgement that respondents were indeed employed by petitioner.\n\nOn this score, the Court adopts the findings in Pamplona Plantation Company, Inc. v. Tinghil , [8] which involves the same petitioner in this case and some of its workers.\u00a0 In that case, petitioner contended that the case should have been dismissed because of the respondents\u2019 failure to implead the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation, Inc. as an indispensable party, since as admitted in their respective affidavits, it was their true and real employer.\u00a0 The Court, however, rejected petitioner\u2019s contention and concluded that by piercing the veil of corporate fiction, the two corporations \u2013 the Pamplona Plantation Corporation, Inc. and the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation \u2013 are one and the same.\u00a0 Thus, the Court ruled:\nAn examination of the facts reveals that, for both the coconut plantation and the golf course, there is only one management which the laborers deal with regarding their work.\u00a0 A portion of the plantation (also called Hacienda Pamplona) had actually been converted into a golf course and other recreational facilities. The weekly payrolls issued by petitioner-company bore the name \u201cPamplona Plantation Co., Inc.\u201d\u00a0 It is also a fact that respondents all received their pay from the same person, Petitioner Bondoc -- the managing director of the company. Since the workers were working for a firm known as Pamplona Plantation Co., Inc., the reason they sued their employer through that name was natural and understandable.\n\nTrue, the Petitioner Pamplona Plantation Co., Inc., and the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation appear to be separate corporate entities.\u00a0 But it is settled that this fiction of law cannot be invoked to further an end subversive of justice.\n\nx x x x\n\nIn the present case, the corporations have basically the same incorporators and directors and are headed by the same official.\u00a0 Both use only one office and one payroll and are under one management.\u00a0 In their individual Affidavits, respondents allege that they worked under the supervision and control of Petitioner Bondoc -- the common managing director of both the petitioner-company and the leisure corporation.\u00a0 Some of the laborers of the plantation also work in the golf course. Thus, the attempt to make the two corporations appear as two separate entities, insofar as the workers are concerned, should be viewed as a devious but obvious means to defeat the ends of the law.\u00a0 Such a ploy should not be permitted to cloud the truth and perpetrate an injustice.\n\nWe note that this defense of separate corporate identity was not raised during the proceedings before the labor arbiter.\u00a0 The main argument therein raised by petitioners was their alleged lack of employer-employee relationship with, and power of control over, the means and methods of work of respondents because of the seasonal nature of the latter\u2019s work.\n\nx x x x\n\nIndeed, it was only after this NLRC Decision was issued that the petitioners harped on the separate personality of the Pamplona Plantation Co., Inc., vis-\u00e0-vis the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation.\n\nAs cited above, the NLRC dismissed the Complaints because of the alleged admission of respondents in their Affidavits that they had been working at the golf course.\u00a0 However, it failed to appreciate the rest of their averments.\u00a0 Just because they worked at the golf course did not necessarily mean that they were not employed to do other tasks, especially since the golf course was merely a portion of the coconut plantation.\u00a0 Even petitioners admitted that respondents had been hired as coconut filers, coconut scoopers or charcoal makers. Consequently, NLRC\u2019s conclusion derived from the Affidavits of respondents stating that they were employees of the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation alone was the result of an improper selective appreciation of the entire evidence.\n\nFurthermore, we note that, contrary to the NLRC\u2019s findings, some respondents indicated that their employer was the Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation, while others said that it was the Pamplona Plantation Co., Inc.\u00a0 But in all these Affidavits, both the leisure corporation and petitioner-company were identified or described as entities engaged in the development and operation of sugar and coconut plantations, as well as recreational facilities such as a golf course.\u00a0 These allegations reveal that petitioner successfully confused the workers as to who their true and real employer was.\u00a0 All things considered, their faulty belief that the plantation company and the leisure corporation were one and the same can be attributed solely to petitioners.\u00a0 It would certainly be unjust to prejudice the claims of the workers because of the misleading actions of their employer. [9] Consequently, petitioner cannot now deny that respondents are its employees.\n\nPetitioner also disputes the CA\u2019s finding that respondent Joselito Tinghil was illegally dismissed.\u00a0 According to the CA, petitioner did not at all controvert or dispute Tinghil\u2019s allegation that he was not told not to report for work anymore due to his involvement in union activities. [10]\n\nThe CA\u2019s finding finds sufficient basis from the records of this case.\u00a0 In his Affidavit executed on October 9, 1997, Tinghil stated that some time in May 3, 1997, he, together with other union officers and company employees, were called personally by the project manager, Lito Bundok, [11] who expressed his \u201cdisgust\u201d with their union activities.\u00a0 They were then informed that they will not be allowed to report for work anymore. [12] Petitioner did not at all contest Tinghil\u2019s allegations.\u00a0 Instead, it merely countered that Tinghil\u2019s narration in his affidavit are vague. [13]\n\nIt is well-settled that the employer has the burden of proving that the dismissal was for a valid and just cause. \u00a0Failure to discharge this burden of proof substantially means that the dismissal was not justified and therefore, illegal. [14] Given petitioner\u2019s failure to discharge this burden, the Court sustains the finding of illegal dismissal vis-\u00e0-vis respondent Joselito Tinghil.\n\nLastly, petitioner believes that its manager, Jose Luis Bondoc, should not have been held solidarily liable with the company for the wage differentials awarded to respondents.\u00a0 Petitioner argues that Bondoc is merely an employee of the company and not a corporate director or officer who can be held personally liable therefor.\n\nThe rule is that officers of a corporation are not personally liable for their official acts unless it is shown that they have exceeded their authority.\u00a0 However, the legal fiction that a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from stockholders and members may be disregarded if it is used as a means to perpetuate fraud or an illegal act or as a vehicle for the evasion of an existing obligation, the circumvention of statutes, or to confuse legitimate issues. [15]\n\nMoreover, a corporate officer is not personally liable for the money claims of discharged corporate employees unless he acted with evident malice and bad faith in terminating their employment. [16]\n\nUnder Section 25 of the Corporation Code, three officers are specifically provided for which a corporation must have: president, secretary, and treasurer.\u00a0 The law, however, does not limit corporate officers to these three.\u00a0 Section 25 gives corporations the widest latitude to provide for such other offices, as they may deem necessary.\u00a0 The by-laws may and usually do provide for such other officers, e.g., vice-president, cashier, auditor, and general manager. [17]\n\nIn this case, there is no basis from which it may be deduced that Bondoc, as manager of petitioner, is also a corporate officer such that he may be held liable for the money claims awarded in favor of respondents.\u00a0 Even assuming that he is a corporate officer, still, there is no showing that he acted with evident malice and bad faith.\u00a0 Bondoc may have signed and approved the payrolls; nevertheless, it does not follow that he had a direct hand in determining the amount of respondents\u2019 corresponding salaries and other benefits.\u00a0 Bondoc, therefore, should not have been held liable together with petitioner.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED .\u00a0 The Court of Appeals Decision dated November 26, 2001 is hereby MODIFIED in that Jose Luis Bondoc is absolved of any personal liability as regards the money claims awarded to respondents.\u00a0 In all other respects, the Decision is AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Renato C.

MARCELINA A. SARCON, AND ELY D. SARCON, ROBERTO B. ALVAREZ, CORAZON NOMBRADO,AND GILBERT ANDRALES, IN THEIR PERSONAL CAPACITIES, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nFor resolution is a Motion for Reconsideration dated 21 March 2005 filed by respondents relative to the Court's Decision [1] dated 31 January 2005. The dispositive portion of the Decision, which was in favor of petitioner Felicitacion Borbajo, read as follows:\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 21 September 2001 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 58, is made permanent, subject to the final outcome of Civil Case No. 21239 pending before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 9.\n\nNo cost.\n\nSO ORDERED. [2] Respondents now argue that the aforementioned Civil Case No. 21239 pending before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu City, Branch 9, has since been resolved against petitioner, through a Decision dated 22 April 2003, [3] which is apparently now final and executory. [4] This decision concluded that petitioner had fraudulently obtained the titles over the three (3) road lots that were at the heart of that case, and this case as well. The dispositive portion of this decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants spouses Danilo S. Borbajo and Felicitation B. Borbajo declaring null and void the deed of sale executed by Jose Bontuyan (particularly the three road lots) in favor of defendants. Consequently, TCT No. 117437, 117563 and 117564 are declared null and void.\n\nThe Register of Deeds of Cebu City is directed to cancel said certificates of title and to issue new ones reinstating the certificates of title cancelled by the aforementioned certificates of title.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5] Parenthetically, it bears noting that petitioner Borbajo had died on 20 December 2002, [6] a fact that was made known to the Court only during the period for deliberation on the Motion for Reconsideration. Counsel for petitioner manifests that her six (6) children, as her surviving legal heirs, should be substituted in the present action. [7]\n\nIt should be recalled that the instant case arose from a complaint for injunction filed by petitioner against the respondents, praying that the latter be enjoined from preventing the petitioner from passing thru or otherwise making use of three (3) road lots inside Hidden View Subdivision I. It so happened that these road lots were titled and registered in the name of the petitioner. It was on that basis that the Court held that petitioner was entitled to the writ of injunction, as she could not be prevented from availing of all the attributes of ownership under the Civil Code, as the owner of the road lots. [8] The Court also set aside the finding of the Court of Appeals that road lots cannot be sold to any person, under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957, as amended, noting instead the settled rule that a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked. [9]\n\nNonetheless, the Court observed that a separate case for annulment of titles over the road lots was then pending before the courts, and it was that case which would serve as the proper forum for the claims regarding the legality of Borbajo's titles over the road lots. The Court did state that if it were found \"that the titles of Borbajo were obtained fraudulently, her right to the road lots ceases as well as her right-of-way by virtue of said titles.\" [10] Hence, the dispositive portion which made the writ of preliminary injunction permanent was tagged with a qualifier \"subject to the final outcome of Civil Case No. 21239 pending before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 9.\" [11]\n\nPetitioner, in her Comment to the Motion for Reconsideration, does not dispute that the RTC, Cebu City, Branch 9 had issued the subject decision against her in Civil Case No. 21239. Instead, she claims that the decision did not attain finality for the intervenors in Civil Case No. 21239 \"were not furnished copy ( sic ) of the decision.\" [12] This claim cannot be accepted at face value, especially since an entry of judgment, recording the Decision as final and executory, was issued by the RTC, Cebu City, Branch 9 on 26 June 2003. [13] Petitioner does not allege that the intervenors who purportedly did not receive any copy of the judgment have availed of any legal remedies as a result, and she cannot assert such failure to acquit herself of any liability arising from that judgment.\n\nHence, there is no doubt that a final judgment has been rendered canceling petitioner's titles over the road lots. It likewise appears that this decision has been executed. Attached to the Motion for Reconsideration are certified true copies of three (3) Transfer Certificates of Title, each dated 24 June 2003, covering the three (3) road lots which are now registered in the name of Hidden View Subdivision Homeowners Association, Inc. [14] It is also stated in each of these titles that the previous titles in the name of petitioner (T-117437, T-117563, and T-117564) have accordingly been cancelled by these new titles.\n\nFollowing the Court's Decision, petitioner's right to the road lots as well as her right-of-way by virtue of her titles thereto, had ceased as a result of the decision rendered by the RTC, Cebu City, Branch 9. Notably, even the petition itself conceded that \"until and unless the certificate of title covering these three road lots shall have been decreed to be null and void in a direct proceedings instituted for that purpose, the same shall be respected and in case of violation of its use and enjoyment, the registered owner thereof, is entitled to the protection of law.\" [15] Consequently, the Writ of Injunction confirmed by this Court had since become functus officio , the legal basis thereof having been expired by reason of the 2003 RTC Cebu City Decision.\n\nThe Court still maintains that the Court of Appeals erred in failing to accord due recognition to petitioner's rights as the registered owner of the road lots, still extant at the time it rendered its Decision. Yet considering that petitioner's titles over the road lots have since been nullified in a final and executory judgment which has in fact been executed, there is no longer any basis in law to entitle petitioner to the sought injunctive relief, or for the Court to confirm that such right of relief still exists.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the Decision of the RTC, Cebu City, Branch 9, dated 22 April 2003, in Civil Case No. 21239, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC, Cebu City, Branch 58 made permanent by the Decision of this Court dated 31 January 2005 is hereby declared FUNCTUS OFFICIO.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., and Chico-Nazario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 73-89.\n\n[2] Id. at 89.\n\n[3] Attached as Annex \"A\" to the Motion for Reconsideration.

MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.DECISION LEONEN, J.: These consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994.[1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration.[2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.[4]In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00.[5]On August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco).[6]In order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.I G.R. No. 109645[7]On November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088.[8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\"[9]Several days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case.[10]On April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\"[11] The Motion was granted on the same date.[12]The Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified.[13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties.[14]On July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\"[15]However, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing.[16]At this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition.[17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18](2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19](3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:[T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition.[21]During the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988.[22]On September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name.[23]Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[24]Meanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\"[25]Judge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287.[27]The Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:the Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him[28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late.[29]The Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\"[30]Molina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc.[31]Ortigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order.[32] Ortigas prayed that this court:(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\"[33]IIG.R. No. 112564[34]G.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\"[35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920.[36]TMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\"[37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\"[38]Molina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\"[39]Molina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\"[40]The trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss.[41]Molina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993.[42]Molina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC.[43]Molina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993.[44]IIIRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564In the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:WHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[45]This court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties.[46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13.[47]In addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees.[48]As to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.(2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53](3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54](4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:(a)Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55](b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56](c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57](d) Navarro v. Ortigas[58](e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General[61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[62]The filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.[63]Ortigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\"[64] was not granted.On the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994.[65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645.[66]Also, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\"[67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them.[68]Despite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[69]The second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:TO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.IT IS SO ORDERED.[70]In the Resolution dated July 24, 1995,[71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and(3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]Despite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);(b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and(c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]TMBC filed a Motion for Contempt[74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996,[75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:It is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[76] (Emphasis in the original)With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary.[77]TMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108.[78]In the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:WHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.SO ORDERED.[79] (Emphasis in the original)IVFacts of G.R. No. 128422Respondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint,[80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\"[81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\"[82]Oreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands.[83]The registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas.[84]The one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\"[85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.TMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership.[86]In 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\"[87]Molina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\"[88]Molina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael.[89]However, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\"[90]Several of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina.[91]Oreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos,[92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:Psd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated.[93](2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau,[94] stating that:The procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents.[95](3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:from which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings.[96](4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967.[97]Oreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287[98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167,[99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him.[100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\"[101]Molina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939.[102]In September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\"[103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau.[104]Molina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint.[105]In the Resolution dated July 21, 1994,[106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case.[107]Oreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994.[108]Oreta filed a Petition for Review[109] before the Department of Justice.Oreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court.[110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina.[111]With regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088.[112]Molina filed a Comment,[113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088[114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis.[115]Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996.[116]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents.[117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996.[118]Undaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[119] before the Court of Appeals.In her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:Whether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding?[120]Molina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her.[121]The Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:It appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.SO ORDERED.[122]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition.[123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\"[124]The Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997.[125]The Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed.[126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\"[127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals,[128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case.[129]From the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[130] before this court.V Facts of G.R. No. 128911On January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564.[131]The action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856.[132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title.[133]TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court.[134]Molina opposed the Motion to Dismiss.[135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997.[136]TMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes)[137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:Before this Court are the following:Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997TMBC Motion to DismissBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to DismissTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.Considering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.Accordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.Let summons be served on the newly named defendant.There is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.SO ORDERED.[138]TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.[139]TMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order.[140]TMBC and Reyes argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint.[141]TMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina.[142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping.[143]VI Procedural developmentIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment.[144]Oreta filed a Motion to Consolidate[145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997.[146]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate[147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.[148]Molina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate.[149]In the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate.[150]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases.[151]In the Resolution dated June 23, 1997,[152] this court noted the following:(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;(b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;(c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and(d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997.[154]On August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction].[155]TMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920.[157]TMBC and Reyes also argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice.[158]In the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\"[159]In the Resolution dated September 3, 1997,[160] this court noted the following:(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina.(b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder[161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997)[162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder.[163]In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.][165]In the same Resolution,[166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.[167]TMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997].[168]TMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket[169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\"[170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic.[171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997.[172]From the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance[173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911.[174]VIIIssuesIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and](2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal.[175]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176] over TMBC's properties; and(2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.VIIIArguments of the partiesG.R. No. 128422Molina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition,[178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office.[179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\"[180]Molina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[181]Molina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\"[182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process.[183]On the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment.[184]Molina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088.[185]Oreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\"[186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:[187]Section 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)Molina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside.[188]Since an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\"[189]Oreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed.[190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment.[191]In her Reply,[192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\"[193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088.[194]Molina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[195]Oreta filed a Rejoinder[196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review.[197]G.R. No. 128911TMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.][198]Ownership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina,[199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation,[200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta,[201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol.[202]Despite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title[203] and an Amended Complaint.[204]TMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:That I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof.[205]Molina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void.[206]In her Comment,[207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court.[208]She filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party.[209]The Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes.[210]The trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes.[211]TMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997.[212]Molina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was.[213]Molina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss.[214]This court now rules as follows:G.R. No. 128422The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997[215] and March 11, 1997[216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.Section 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:Section 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.b. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.d. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96[217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.In Donato v. Court of Appeals,[218] this court held that:[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration.[219]The ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David[220] and Valdecantos v. People[221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.In this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:In the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration.[222] (Emphasis supplied)Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.However, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.Prior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her.[223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996.[224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997.[225]In other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.In Crespo v. Judge Mogul:[226][t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.In order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court.[227]The ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al.[228]In subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts.[229]Chan v. Formaran III, et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.[230] It was further discussed that:[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion.[231]Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.In any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).Chief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\"[232] He discussed the following:Contrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.We have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title.[233]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:After an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor.[234]Chief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.This court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata:[235][T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well.[236]G.R. No. 128911In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:In its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"The case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.Now, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.SO ORDERED.[238]TMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997.[239]Molina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation[240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case:[241]3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC.[242]Molina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases.[243]In addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier.[244]Judge Bacalla also filed his explanation.[245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina, he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997.[246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997.[247]Molina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated.[248]This court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.In the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:WHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.In G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[249]That Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.Forum shopping is defined as:[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court.[250]Forum shopping consists of the following elements:(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.[251]All the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.For the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:ascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.[252]In this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership.[253]Molina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.Further, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.The elements of res judicata are:(a) the former judgment must be final;(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and(d) there must be between the first and the second actions (i) identity of parties, (ii) identity of subject matter, and (iii) identity of cause of action.[254]These requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.This court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00.[256]This court held that:[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \"no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.Apart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.Evidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.Evidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[257] (Emphasis in the original)Regarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997.[258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:(1)DECLARE Dolores V. Molina GUILTY of contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;(2) The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is made PERMANENT; and(3) Treble costs[259] are imposed against Dolores V. Molina.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr.,* Del Castillo (Acting Chairperson), Villarama, Jr.,** and Mendoza, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting Member per S.O.

MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nLEONEN, J.:\n\nThese consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.\n\nG.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994. [1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration. [2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration. [4]\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00. [5]\n\nOn August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco). [6]\n\nIn order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.\n\nI\nG.R. No. 109645 [7]\n\nOn November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088. [8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\" [9]\n\nSeveral days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case. [10]\n\nOn April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\" [11] The Motion was granted on the same date. [12]\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified. [13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties. [14]\n\nOn July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:\n(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\" [15]\nHowever, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing. [16]\n\nAt this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition. [17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18]\n | \n(2) | Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19]\n | \n(3) | The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:\n | \n | [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\" [18] (2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina. [19] (3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that: [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc. [20] Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition. [21]\n\nDuring the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:\n[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988. [22]\nOn September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name. [23]\n\nOrtigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [24]\n\nMeanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\" [25]\n\nJudge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287. [27]\n\nThe Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:\nthe Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him [28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late. [29]\nThe Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\" [30]\n\nMolina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc. [31]\n\nOrtigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. [32] Ortigas prayed that this court:\n(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and\n\n(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\" [33]\nII\nG.R. No. 112564 [34]\n\nG.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\" [35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920. [36]\n\nTMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\" [37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\" [38]\n\nMolina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\" [39]\n\nMolina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\" [40]\n\nThe trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss. [41]\n\nMolina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993. [42]\n\nMolina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC. [43]\n\nMolina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993. [44]\n\nIII\nRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564\n\nIn the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [45]\nThis court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties. [46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13. [47]\n\nIn addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:\n[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees. [48]\nAs to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49]of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.\n | | \n(2) | As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50]She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51]Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52]She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53]\n | | \n(3) | The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54]\n | | \n(4) | Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:\n | | \n | (a) | Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55]\n | (b) | Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56]\n | (c) | Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57]\n | (d) | Navarro v. Ortigas[58]\n | (e) | Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59]The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\" [49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs. (2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\" [50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her. [51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088. [52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\" [53] (3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\" [54] (4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely: (a) Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo [55] (b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz [56] (c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas [57] (d) Navarro v. Ortigas [58] (e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085. [59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\" [60] This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General [61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [62]\n\nThe filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt. [63]\n\nOrtigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\" [64] was not granted.\n\nOn the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994. [65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645. [66]\n\nAlso, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\" [67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them. [68]\n\nDespite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [69]\n\nThe second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:\nTO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [70]\nIn the Resolution dated July 24, 1995, [71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(2) | To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and\n | \n(3) | To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and (3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition. [72]\nDespite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);\n | \n(b) | [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and\n | \n(c) | [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995); (b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and (c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\" [73]\nTMBC filed a Motion for Contempt [74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, [75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:\nIt is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [76] (Emphasis in the original) With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary. [77]\n\nTMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108. [78]\n\nIn the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:\nWHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [79] (Emphasis in the original)\nIV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128422\n\nRespondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint, [80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\" [81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\" [82]\n\nOreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands. [83]\n\nThe registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas. [84]\n\nThe one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\" [85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.\n\nTMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership. [86]\n\nIn 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\" [87]\n\nMolina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\" [88]\n\nMolina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael. [89]\n\nHowever, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\" [90]\n\nSeveral of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina. [91]\n\nOreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:\n\n(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos, [92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:\nPsd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated. [93]\n(2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau, [94] stating that:\nThe procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents. [95]\n(3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:\nfrom which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings. [96]\n(4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967. [97]\n\nOreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287 [98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167, [99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him. [100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\" [101]\n\nMolina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939. [102]\n\nIn September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\" [103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau. [104]\n\nMolina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint. [105]\n\nIn the Resolution dated July 21, 1994, [106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case. [107]\n\nOreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994. [108]\n\nOreta filed a Petition for Review [109] before the Department of Justice.\n\nOreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court. [110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina. [111]\n\nWith regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088. [112]\n\nMolina filed a Comment, [113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088 [114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis. [115]\n\nChief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996. [116]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents. [117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996. [118]\n\nUndaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [119] before the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:\nWhether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding? [120]\nMolina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her. [121]\n\nThe Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:\nIt appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.\n\nSO ORDERED. [122]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition. [123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\" [124]\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997. [125]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed. [126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\" [127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals , [128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case. [129]\n\nFrom the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [130] before this court.\n\nV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128911\n\nOn January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564. [131]\n\nThe action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856. [132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title. [133]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court. [134]\n\nMolina opposed the Motion to Dismiss. [135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997. [136]\n\nTMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes) [137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:\nBefore this Court are the following:\nSupplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997\n\nTMBC Motion to Dismiss\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to Dismiss\n\nTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.\nConsidering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.\n\nAccordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.\n\nLet summons be served on the newly named defendant.\n\nThere is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.\n\nSO ORDERED. [138]\nTMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. [139]\n\nTMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order. [140]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint. [141]\nTMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina. [142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping. [143]\n\nVI\nProcedural development\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment. [144]\n\nOreta filed a Motion to Consolidate [145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997. [146]\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate [147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. [148]\n\nMolina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate. [149]\n\nIn the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate. [150]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases. [151]\n\nIn the Resolution dated June 23, 1997, [152] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;\n(b) | Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;\n(c) | Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and\n(d) | Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction; (b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina; (c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and (d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911. [153] TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997. [154]\n\nOn August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction]. [155]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. [157]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice. [158]\nIn the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\" [159]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 3, 1997, [160] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | In G.R. No. 128911:\n | (i) | TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and\n | (ii) | Comment filed by Dolores Molina.\n(b) | In G.R. No. 128422:\n | (i) | Comment filed by Oreta;\n | (ii) | Reply filed by Molina; and\n | (iii) | Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina. (b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply. Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder [161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997) [162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder. [163]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.] [165]\nIn the same Resolution, [166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment. [167]\nTMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997]. [168]\n\nTMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket [169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\" [170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic. [171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:\n6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;\n\n6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997. [172]\nFrom the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance [173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911. [174]\n\nVII\nIssues\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:\n(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and]\n\n(2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal. [175]\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176]over TMBC's properties; and\n | \n(2) | Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177]and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\" [176] over TMBC's properties; and (2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, [177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\nVIII\nArguments of the parties\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nMolina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition, [178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office. [179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\" [180]\n\nMolina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [181]\n\nMolina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\" [182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process. [183]\n\nOn the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment. [184]\n\nMolina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088. [185]\n\nOreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\" [186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure: [187]\nSection 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:\n\n(a)\u00a0 In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;\n\n(b)\u00a0 In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and\n\n(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)\nMolina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside. [188]\n\nSince an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\" [189]\n\nOreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed. [190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment. [191]\n\nIn her Reply, [192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\" [193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088. [194]\n\nMolina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [195]\n\nOreta filed a Rejoinder [196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review. [197]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nTMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:\n2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.] [198]\nOwnership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina , [199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation , [200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta , [201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol . [202]\n\nDespite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title [203] and an Amended Complaint. [204]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:\nThat I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof. [205]\nMolina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void. [206]\n\nIn her Comment, [207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court. [208]\n\nShe filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party. [209]\n\nThe Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes. [210]\n\nThe trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes. [211]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997. [212]\n\nMolina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was. [213]\n\nMolina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. [214]\n\nThis court now rules as follows:\n\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nThe Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997 [215] and March 11, 1997 [216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.\n\nSection 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:\nSection 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.\n\nb. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.\n\nd. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.\n\n(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.\nSupreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96 [217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:\n1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.\n\n3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.\n\n4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.\n\n5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.\nIn Donato v. Court of Appeals , [218] this court held that:\n[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration. [219]\nThe ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David [220] and Valdecantos v. People [221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.\n\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:\nIn the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration. [222] (Emphasis supplied)\nThus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.\n\nHowever, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.\n\nPrior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her. [223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996. [224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997. [225]\n\nIn other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.\n\nIn Crespo v. Judge Mogul : [226]\n[t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.\n\nIn order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court. [227]\nThe ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al . [228]\nIn subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. [229]\nChan v. Formaran III , et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65. [230] It was further discussed that:\n[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion. [231]\nThus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.\n\nIn any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).\n\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\" [232] He discussed the following:\nContrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.\n\nWe have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title. [233]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:\nAfter an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor. [234]\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThis court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata : [235]\n\n[T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well. [236]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:\nIn its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\n\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.\n\n(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"\nThe case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.\n\nNow, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.\n\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;\n\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [238]\nTMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997. [239]\n\nMolina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation [240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case: [241]\n3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC. [242]\nMolina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases. [243]\n\nIn addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier. [244]\n\nJudge Bacalla also filed his explanation. [245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina , he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997. [246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997. [247]\n\nMolina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated. [248]\n\nThis court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [249]\nThat Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.\n\nForum shopping is defined as:\n[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court. [250]\nForum shopping consists of the following elements:\n(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;\n\n(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and\n\n(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration. [251]\nAll the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.\n\nFor the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:\nascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. [252]\nIn this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership. [253]\n\nMolina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nFurther, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.\n\nThe elements of res judicata are:\n(a) the former judgment must be final;\n\n(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;\n\n(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and\n\n(d) there must be between the first and the second actions\n\n(i) identity of parties,\n\n(ii) identity of subject matter, and\n\n(iii) identity of cause of action. [254]\nThese requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nThis court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00. [256]\n\nThis court held that:\n[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \" no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.\n\nApart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.\n\nEvidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.\n\nEvidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [257] (Emphasis in the original)\nRegarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997. [258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | DECLAREDolores V. MolinaGUILTYof contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;\n | \n(2) | The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is madePERMANENT; and\n | \n(3) | Treble costs[259]are imposed against Dolores V.

      "title": "that it was not amenable to the payment of the full rentals citing as reasons unforeseen legal and other circumstances which prevented it from complying with its obligations. PAGCOR further stated that it had no other alternative but to pre-terminate the lease agreement due to the relentless and vehement opposition to their casino operations. In a letter dated October 12, 1993 x x x, PAGCOR asked PPC to refund the total of P1,437,582.25 representing the reimbursable rental deposits and expenses for the permanent improvement of the Hotel's parking lot. In a letter dated November 5, 1993 x x x, PAGCOR formally demanded from PPC the payment of its claim for reimbursement.\"On November 15, 1993 x x x, PPC filed a case for sum of money in the Regional Trial Court of Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 93-68266. On November 19, 1993, PAGCOR also filed a case for sum of money in the Regional Trial Court of Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 93-68337.\"In a letter dated November 25, 1993, PPC informed PAGCOR that it was terminating the contract of lease due to PAGCOR's continuing breach of the contract and further stated that it was exercising its rights under the contract of lease pursuant to Article 20 (a) and (c) thereof.\"On February 2, 1994, PPC filed a supplemental complaint x x x in Civil Case No. 93-68266, which the trial court admitted in an Order dated February 11, 1994. In an Order dated April 27, 1994, Civil Case No. 93-68377 was ordered consolidated with Civil Case No. 93-68266. These cases were jointly tried by the court a quo. On August 17, 1995, the court a quo promulgated its decision. Both parties appealed.\"[5]In its appeal, PPC faulted the trial court for the following reasons: 1) failure of the court to award actual and moral damages; 2) the 50 percent reduction of the amount PPC was claiming; and 3) the court's ruling that the 2 percent penalty was to be imposed from the date of the promulgation of the Decision, not from the date stipulated in the Contract.On the other hand, PAGCOR criticized the trial court for the latter's failure to rule that the Contract of Lease had already been terminated as early as September 21, 1993, or at the latest, on October 14, 1993, when PPC received PAGCOR's letter dated October 12, 1993. The gaming corporation added that the trial court erred in 1) failing to consider that PPC was entitled to avail itself of the provisions of Article XX only when PPC was the party terminating the Contract; 2) not finding that there were valid, justifiable and good reasons for terminating the Contract; and 3) dismissing the Complaint of PAGCOR in Civil Case No. 93-68337 for lack of merit, and not finding PPC liable for the reimbursement of PAGCOR'S cash deposits and of the value of improvements.Ruling of the Court of AppealsFirst, on the appeal of PAGCOR, the CA ruled that the PAGCOR'S pretermination of the Contract of Lease was unjustified. The appellate court explained that public demonstrations and rallies could not be considered as fortuitous events that would exempt the gaming corporation from complying with the latter's contractual obligations. Therefore, the Contract continued to be effective until PPC elected to terminate it on November 25, 1993.Regarding the contentions of PPC, the CA held that under Article 1659 of the Civil Code, PPC had the right to ask for (1) rescission of the Contract and indemnification for damages; or (2) only indemnification plus the continuation of the Contract. These two remedies were alternative, not cumulative, ruled the CA.As PAGCOR had admitted its failure to pay the rentals for September to November 1993, PPC correctly exercised the option to terminate the lease agreement. Previously, the Contract remained effective, and PPC could collect the accrued rentals. However, from the time it terminated the Contract on November 25, 1993, PPC could no longer demand payment of the remaining rentals as part of actual damages, the CA added.Denying the claim for moral damages, the CA pointed out the failure of PPC to show that PAGCOR had acted in gross or evident bad faith in failing to pay the rentals from September to November 1993. Such failure was shown especially by the fact that PPC still had in hand three (3) months advance rental deposits of PAGCOR. The former could have simply applied this deposit to the unpaid rentals, as provided in the Contract. Neither did PPC adequately show that its reputation had been besmirched or the hotel's goodwill eroded by the establishment of the casino and the public protests.Finally, as to the claimed reimbursement for parking lot improvement, the CA held that PAGCOR had not presented official receipts to prove the latter's alleged expenses. The appellate court, however, upheld the trial court's award to PPC of P50,000 attorney's fees.Hence this Petition.[6]IssuesIn their Memorandum, petitioner raised the following issues:\"MAIN ISSUE:\"Did the Honorable Court of Appeals commit x x x grave and reversible error by holding that Pryce was not entitled to future rentals or lease payments for the unexpired period of the Contract of Lease between Pryce and PAGCOR?\"Sub-Issues:\"1. Were the provisions of Sections 20(a) and 20(c) of the Contract of Lease relative to the right of PRYCE to terminate the Contract for cause and to moreover collect rentals from PAGCOR corresponding to the remaining term of the lease valid and binding?\"2. Did not Article 1659 of the Civil Code supersede Sections 20(a) and 20(c) of the Contract, PRYCE having \"rescinded\" the Contract of Lease?\"3. Do the case of Rios, et al. vs. Jacinto Palma Enterprises, et al. and the other cases cited by PAGCOR support its position that PRYCE was not entitled to future rentals?\"4. Would the collection by PRYCE of future rentals not give rise to unjust enrichment?\"5. Could we not have \"harmonized\" Article 1659 of the Civil Code and Article 20 of the Contract of Lease?\"6. Is it not a basic rule that the law, i.e. Article 1659, is deemed written in contracts, particularly in the PRYCE-PAGCOR Contract of Lease?\"[7]The Court's RulingThe Petition is partly meritorious.Main Issue:Collection of Remaining RentalsPPC anchors its right to collect future rentals upon the provisions of the Contract. Likewise, it argues that termination, as defined under the Contract, is different from the remedy of rescission prescribed under Article 1659 of the Civil Code. On the other hand, PAGCOR contends, as the CA ruled, that Article 1659 of the Civil Code governs; hence, PPC is allegedly no longer entitled to future rentals, because it chose to rescind the Contract.Contract ProvisionsClear and BindingArticle 1159 of the Civil Code provides that \"obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.\"[8] In deference to the rights of the parties, the law[9] allows them to enter into stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions they may deem convenient; that is, as long as these are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy. Likewise, it is settled that if the terms of the contract clearly express the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of the stipulations would be controlling.[10]In this case, Article XX of the parties' Contract of Lease provides in part as follows:\"XX. BREACH OR DEFAULT\"a) The LESSEE agrees that all the terms, conditions and/or covenants herein contained shall be deemed essential conditions of this contract, and in the event of default or breach of any of such terms, conditions and/or covenants, or should the LESSEE become bankrupt, or insolvent, or compounds with his creditors, the LESSOR shall have the right to terminate and cancel this contract by giving them fifteen (15 days) prior notice delivered at the leased premises or posted on the main door thereof. Upon such termination or cancellation, the LESSOR may forthwith lock the premises and exclude the LESSEE therefrom, forcefully or otherwise, without incurring any civil or criminal liability. During the fifteen (15) days notice, the LESSEE may prevent the termination of lease by curing the events or causes of termination or cancellation of the lease.\"b) x x x x x x x x x\"c) Moreover, the LESSEE shall be fully liable to the LESSOR for the rentals corresponding to the remaining term of the lease as well as for any and all damages, actual or consequential resulting from such default and termination of this contract.\"d) x x x x x x x x x.\" (Italics supplied)The above provisions leave no doubt that the parties have covenanted 1) to give PPC the right to terminate and cancel the Contract in the event of a default or breach by the lessee; and 2) to make PAGCOR fully liable for rentals for the remaining term of the lease, despite the exercise of such right to terminate. Plainly, the parties have voluntarily bound themselves to require strict compliance with the provisions of the Contract by stipulating that a default or breach, among others, shall give the lessee the termination option, coupled with the lessor's liability for rentals for the remaining term of the lease.For sure, these stipulations are valid and are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy. Neither is there anything objectionable about the inclusion in the Contract of mandatory provisions concerning the rights and obligations of the parties.[11] Being the primary law between the parties, it governs the adjudication of their rights and obligations. A court has no alternative but to enforce the contractual stipulations in the manner they have been agreed upon and written.[12] It is well to recall that courts, be they trial or appellate, have no power to make or modify contracts.[13] Neither can they save parties from disadvantageous provisions.Termination or Rescission?Well-taken is petitioner's insistence that it had the right to ask for \"termination plus the full payment of future rentals\" under the provisions of the Contract, rather than just rescission under Article 1659 of the Civil Code. This Court is not unmindful of the fact that termination and rescission are terms that have been used loosely and interchangeably in the past. But distinctions ought to be made, especially in this controversy, in which the terms mean differently and lead to equally different consequences.The term \"rescission\" is found in 1) Article 1191[14] of the Civil Code, the general provision on rescission of reciprocal obligations; 2) Article 1659,[15] which authorizes rescission as an alternative remedy, insofar as the rights and obligations of the lessor and the lessee in contracts of lease are concerned; and 3) Article 1380[16] with regard to the rescission of contracts.In his Concurring Opinion in Universal Food Corporation v. CA,[17] Justice J. B. L. Reyes differentiated rescission under Article 1191 from that under Article 1381 et seq. as follows:\"x x x. The rescission on account of breach of stipulations is not predicated on injury to economic interests of the party plaintiff but on the breach of faith by the defendant, that violates the reciprocity between the parties. It is not a subsidiary action, and Article 1191 may be scanned without disclosing anywhere that the action for rescission thereunder is subordinated to anything other than the culpable breach of his obligations to the defendant. This rescission is a principal action retaliatory in character, it being unjust that a party be held bound to fulfill his promises when the other violates his. As expressed in the old Latin aphorism: \"Non servanti fidem, non est fides servanda.\" Hence, the reparation of damages for the breach is purely secondary.\"On the contrary, in rescission by reason of lesion or economic prejudice, the cause of action is subordinated to the existence of that prejudice, because it is the raison d'etre as well as the measure of the right to rescind. x x x.\"[18]Relevantly, it has been pointed out that resolution was originally used in Article 1124 of the old Civil Code, and that the term became the basis for rescission under Article 1191 (and, conformably, also Article 1659).[19]Now, as to the distinction between termination (or cancellation) and rescission (more properly, resolution), Huibonhoa v. CA[20] held that, where the action prayed for the payment of rental arrearages, the aggrieved party actually sought the partial enforcement of a lease contract. Thus, the remedy was not rescission, but termination or cancellation, of the contract. The Court explained:\"x x x. By the allegations of the complaint, the Gojoccos' aim was to cancel or terminate the contract because they sought its partial enforcement in praying for rental arrearages. There is a distinction in law between cancellation of a contract and its rescission. To rescind is to declare a contract void in its inception and to put an end to it as though it never were. It is not merely to terminate it and release parties from further obligations to each other but to abrogate it from the beginning and restore the parties to relative positions which they would have occupied had no contract ever been made.\"x x x. The termination or cancellation of a contract would necessarily entail enforcement of its terms prior to the declaration of its cancellation in the same way that before a lessee is ejected under a lease contract, he has to fulfill his obligations thereunder that had accrued prior to his ejectment. However, termination of a contract need not undergo judicial intervention. x x x.\"[21] (Italics supplied)Rescission has likewise been defined as the \"unmaking of a contract, or its undoing from the beginning, and not merely its termination.\" Rescission may be effected by both parties by mutual agreement; or unilaterally by one of them declaring a rescission of contract without the consent of the other, if a legally sufficient ground exists or if a decree of rescission is applied for before the courts.[22] On the other hand, termination refers to an \"end in time or existence; a close, cessation or conclusion.\" With respect to a lease or contract, it means an ending, usually before the end of the anticipated term of such lease or contract, that may be effected by mutual agreement or by one party exercising one of its remedies as a consequence of the default of the other.[23]Thus, mutual restitution is required in a rescission (or resolution), in order to bring back the parties to their original situation prior to the inception of the contract.[24] Applying this principle to this case, it means that PPC would re-acquire possession of the leased premises, and PAGCOR would get back the rentals it paid the former for the use of the hotel space.In contrast, the parties in a case of termination are not restored to their original situation; neither is the contract treated as if it never existed. Prior to its termination, the parties are obliged to comply with their contractual obligations. Only after the contract has been cancelled will they be released from their obligations.In this case, the actions and pleadings of petitioner show that it never intended to rescind the Lease Contract from the beginning. This fact was evident when it first sought to collect the accrued rentals from September to November 1993 because, as previously stated, it actually demanded the enforcement of the Lease Contract prior to termination. Any intent to rescind was not shown, even when it abrogated the Contract on November 25, 1993, because such abrogation was not the rescission provided for under Article 1659.Future RentalsAs to the remaining sub-issue of future rentals, Rios v. Jacinto[25] is inapplicable, because the remedy resorted to by the lessors in that case was rescission, not termination. The rights and obligations of the parties in Rios were governed by Article 1659 of the Civil Code; hence, the Court held that the damages to which the lessor was entitled could not have extended to the lessee's liability for future rentals.Upon the other hand, future rentals cannot be claimed as compensation for the use or enjoyment of another's property after the termination of a contract. We stress that by abrogating the Contract in the present case, PPC released PAGCOR from the latter's future obligations, which included the payment of rentals. To grant that right to the former is to unjustly enrich it at the latter's expense.However, it appears that Section XX (c) was intended to be a penalty clause. That fact is manifest from a reading of the mandatory provision under subparagraph (a) in conjunction with subparagraph (c) of the Contract. A penal clause is \"an accessory obligation which the parties attach to a principal obligation for the purpose of insuring the performance thereof by imposing on the debtor a special prestation (generally consisting in the payment of a sum of money) in case the obligation is not fulfilled or is irregularly or inadequately fulfilled.\"[26]Quite common in lease contracts, this clause functions to strengthen the coercive force of the obligation and to provide, in effect, for what could be the liquidated damages resulting from a breach.[27] There is nothing immoral or illegal in such indemnity/penalty clause, absent any showing that it was forced upon or fraudulently foisted on the obligor.[28]In obligations with a penal clause, the general rule is that the penalty serves as a substitute for the indemnity for damages and the payment of interests in case of noncompliance; that is, if there is no stipulation to the contrary,[29] in which case proof of actual damages is not necessary for the penalty to be demanded.[30] There are exceptions to the aforementioned rule, however, as enumerated in paragraph 1 of Article 1226 of the Civil Code: 1) when there is a stipulation to the contrary, 2) when the obligor is sued for refusal to pay the agreed penalty, and 3) when the obligor is guilty of fraud. In these cases, the purpose of the penalty is obviously to punish the obligor for the breach. Hence, the obligee can recover from the former not only the penalty, but also other damages resulting from the nonfulfillment of the principal obligation. [31]In the present case, the first exception applies because Article XX (c) provides that, aside from the payment of the rentals corresponding to the remaining term of the lease, the lessee shall also be liable \"for any and all damages, actual or consequential, resulting from such default and termination of this contract.\" Having entered into the Contract voluntarily and with full knowledge of its provisions, PAGCOR must be held bound to its obligations. It cannot evade further liability for liquidated damages.Reduction of PenaltyIn certain cases, a stipulated penalty may nevertheless be equitably reduced by the courts.[32] This power is explicitly sanctioned by Articles 1229 and 2227 of the Civil Code, which we quote:\"Art. 1229. The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable.\"\"Art. 2227. Liquidated damages, whether intended as an indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably reduced if they are iniquitous or unconscionable.\"The question of whether a penalty is reasonable or iniquitous is addressed to the sound discretion of the courts. To be considered in fixing the amount of penalty are factors such as -- but not limited to -- the type, extent and purpose of the penalty; the nature of the obligation; the mode of the breach and its consequences; the supervening realities; the standing and relationship of the parties; and the like.[33]In this case, PAGCOR's breach was occasioned by events that, although not fortuitous in law, were in fact real and pressing. From the CA's factual findings, which are not contested by either party, we find that PAGCOR conducted a series of negotiations and consultations before entering into the Contract. It did so not only with the PPC, but also with local government officials, who assured it that the problems were surmountable. Likewise, PAGCOR took pains to contest the ordinances[34] before the courts, which consequently declared them unconstitutional. On top of these developments, the gaming corporation was advised by the Office of the President to stop the games in Cagayan de Oro City, prompting the former to cease operations prior to September 1993.Also worth mentioning is the CA's finding that PAGCOR's casino operations had to be suspended for days on end since their start in December 1992; and indefinitely from July 15, 1993, upon the advice of the Office of President, until the formal cessation of operations in September 1993. Needless to say, these interruptions and stoppages meant that PAGCOR suffered a tremendous loss of expected revenues, not to mention the fact that it had fully operated under the Contract only for a limited time.While petitioner's right to a stipulated penalty is affirmed, we consider the claim for future rentals to the tune of P7,037,835.40 to be highly iniquitous. The amount should be equitably reduced. Under the circumstances, the advanced rental deposits in the sum of P687,289.50 should be sufficient penalty for respondent's breach.WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED in part. The assailed Decision and Resolution are hereby MODIFIED to include the payment of penalty. Accordingly, respondent is ordered to pay petitioner the additional amount of P687,289.50 as penalty, which may be set off or applied against the former's advanced rental deposits. Meanwhile, the CA's award to petitioner of actual damages representing the accrued rentals for September to November 1993 -- with interest and penalty at the rate of two percent (2%) per month, from the date of filing of the Complaint until the amount shall have been fully paid -- as well as the P50,000 award for attorney's fees, is AFFIRMED.

PHILIPPINE AMUSEMENT AND GAMING CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nIn legal contemplation, the termination of a contract is not equivalent to its rescission . When an agreement is terminated, it is deemed valid at inception. Prior to termination, the contract binds the parties, who are thus obliged to observe its provisions. However, when it is rescinded, it is deemed inexistent, and the parties are returned to their status quo ante. Hence, there is mutual restitution of benefits received. The consequences of termination may be anticipated and provided for by the contract. As long as the terms of the contract are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy, they shall be respected by courts. The judiciary is not authorized to make or modify contracts; neither may it rescue parties from disadvantageous stipulations. Courts, however, are empowered to reduce iniquitous or unconscionable liquidated damages, indemnities and penalties agreed upon by the parties.\n\nThe Case\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review [1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the May 22, 2002 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 51629 and its March 4, 2003 Resolution [3] denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. The assailed Decision disposed thus:\n\"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: (1) In Civil Case No. 93-68266, the appealed decision[,] is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION[,] ordering [Respondent] Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation to pay [Petitioner] Pryce Properties Corporation the total amount of P687,289.50 as actual damages representing the accrued rentals for the quarter September to November 1993 with interest and penalty at the rate of two percent (2%) per month from date of filing of the complaint until the amount shall have been fully paid, and the sum of P50,000.00 as attorney's fees; (2) In Civil Case No. 93-68337, the appealed decision is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new judgment is rendered ordering [Petitioner] Pryce Properties Corporation to reimburse [Respondent] Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation the amount of P687,289.50 representing the advanced rental deposits, which amount may be compensated by [Petitioner] Pryce Properties Corporation with its award in Civil Case No. 93-68266 in the equal amount of P687,289.50.\" [4]\nThe Facts\n\nAccording to the CA, the facts are as follows:\n\"Sometime in the first half of 1992, representatives from Pryce Properties Corporation (PPC for brevity) made representations with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) on the possibility of setting up a casino in Pryce Plaza Hotel in Cagayan de Oro City. [A] series of negotiations followed. PAGCOR representatives went to Cagayan de Oro City to determine the pulse of the people whether the presence of a casino would be welcomed by the residents. Some local government officials showed keen interest in the casino operation and expressed the view that possible problems were surmountable. Their negotiations culminated with PPC's counter-letter proposal dated October 14, 1992.\n\n\"On November 11, 1992, the parties executed a Contract of Lease x x x involving the ballroom of the Hotel for a period of three (3) years starting December 1, 1992 and until November 30, 1995. On November 13, 1992, they executed an addendum to the contract x x x which included a lease of an additional 1000 square meters of the hotel grounds as living quarters and playground of the casino personnel. PAGCOR advertised the start of their casino operations on December 18, 1992.\n\n\"Way back in 1990, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cagayan de Oro City passed Resolution No. 2295 x x x dated November 19, 1990 declaring as a matter of policy to prohibit and/or not to allow the establishment of a gambling casino in Cagayan de Oro City. Resolution No. 2673 x x x dated October 19, 1992 (or a month before the contract of lease was executed) was subsequently passed reiterating with vigor and vehemence the policy of the City under Resolution No. 2295, series of 1990, banning casinos in Cagayan de Oro City. On December 7, 1992, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cagayan de Oro City enacted Ordinance No. 3353 x x x prohibiting the issuance of business permits and canceling existing business permits to any establishment for using, or allowing to be used, its premises or any portion thereof for the operation of a casino.\n\n\"In the afternoon of December 18, 1992 and just hours before the actual formal opening of casino operations, a public rally in front of the hotel was staged by some local officials, residents and religious leaders. Barricades were placed [which] prevented some casino personnel and hotel guests from entering and exiting from the Hotel. PAGCOR was constrained to suspend casino operations because of the rally. An agreement between PPC and PAGCOR, on one hand, and representatives of the rallyists, on the other, eventually ended the rally on the 20th of December, 1992.\n\n\"On January 4, 1993, Ordinance No. 3375-93 x x x was passed by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cagayan de Oro City, prohibiting the operation of casinos and providing for penalty for violation thereof. On January 7, 1993, PPC filed a Petition for Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction x x x against then public respondent Cagayan de Oro City and/or Mayor Pablo P. Magtajas x x x before the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA G.R. SP No. 29851 praying inter alia , for the declaration of unconstitutionality of Ordinance No. 3353. PAGCOR intervened in said petition and further assailed Ordinance No. 4475-93 as being violative of the non-impairment of contracts and equal protection clauses. On March 31, 1993, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision x x x, the dispositive portion of which reads:\n\"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, Ordinance No. 3353 and Ordinance No. 3375-93 are hereby DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL and VOID and the respondents and all other persons acting under their authority and in their behalf are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from enforcing those ordinances.\n\n\"SO ORDERED.\"\n\"Aggrieved by the decision, then public respondents Cagayan de Oro City, et al. elevated the case to the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 111097, where, in an En Banc Decision dated July 20, 1994 x x x, the Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\"In the meantime, PAGCOR resumed casino operations on July 15, 1993, against which, however, another public rally was held. Casino operations continued for some time, but were later on indefinitely suspended due to the incessant demonstrations. Per verbal advice x x x from the Office of the President of the Philippines, PAGCOR decided to stop its casino operations in Cagayan de Oro City. PAGCOR stopped its casino operations in the hotel prior to September, 1993. In two Statements of Account dated September 1, 1993 x x x, PPC apprised PAGCOR of its outstanding account for the quarter September 1 to November 30, 1993. PPC sent PAGCOR another Letter dated September 3, 1993 x x x as a follow-up to the parties' earlier conference. PPC sent PAGCOR another Letter dated September 15, 1993 x x x stating its Board of Directors' decision to collect the full rentals in case of pre-termination of the lease.\n\n\"PAGCOR sent PPC a letter dated September 20, 1993 x x x [stating] that it was not amenable to the payment of the full rentals citing as reasons unforeseen legal and other circumstances which prevented it from complying with its obligations. PAGCOR further stated that it had no other alternative but to pre-terminate the lease agreement due to the relentless and vehement opposition to their casino operations. In a letter dated October 12, 1993 x x x, PAGCOR asked PPC to refund the total of P1,437,582.25 representing the reimbursable rental deposits and expenses for the permanent improvement of the Hotel's parking lot. In a letter dated November 5, 1993 x x x, PAGCOR formally demanded from PPC the payment of its claim for reimbursement.\n\n\"On November 15, 1993 x x x, PPC filed a case for sum of money in the Regional Trial Court of Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 93-68266. On November 19, 1993, PAGCOR also filed a case for sum of money in the Regional Trial Court of Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 93-68337.\n\n\"In a letter dated November 25, 1993, PPC informed PAGCOR that it was terminating the contract of lease due to PAGCOR's continuing breach of the contract and further stated that it was exercising its rights under the contract of lease pursuant to Article 20 (a) and (c) thereof.\n\n\"On February 2, 1994, PPC filed a supplemental complaint x x x in Civil Case No. 93-68266, which the trial court admitted in an Order dated February 11, 1994. In an Order dated April 27, 1994, Civil Case No. 93-68377 was ordered consolidated with Civil Case No. 93-68266. These cases were jointly tried by the court a quo. On August 17, 1995, the court a quo promulgated its decision. Both parties appealed.\" [5]\nIn its appeal, PPC faulted the trial court for the following reasons: 1) failure of the court to award actual and moral damages; 2) the 50 percent reduction of the amount PPC was claiming; and 3) the court's ruling that the 2 percent penalty was to be imposed from the date of the promulgation of the Decision, not from the date stipulated in the Contract.\n\nOn the other hand, PAGCOR criticized the trial court for the latter's failure to rule that the Contract of Lease had already been terminated as early as September 21, 1993, or at the latest, on October 14, 1993, when PPC received PAGCOR's letter dated October 12, 1993. The gaming corporation added that the trial court erred in 1) failing to consider that PPC was entitled to avail itself of the provisions of Article XX only when PPC was the party terminating the Contract; 2) not finding that there were valid, justifiable and good reasons for terminating the Contract; and 3) dismissing the Complaint of PAGCOR in Civil Case No. 93-68337 for lack of merit, and not finding PPC liable for the reimbursement of PAGCOR'S cash deposits and of the value of improvements.\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\n\nFirst, on the appeal of PAGCOR, the CA ruled that the PAGCOR'S pretermination of the Contract of Lease was unjustified. The appellate court explained that public demonstrations and rallies could not be considered as fortuitous events that would exempt the gaming corporation from complying with the latter's contractual obligations. Therefore, the Contract continued to be effective until PPC elected to terminate it on November 25, 1993.\n\nRegarding the contentions of PPC, the CA held that under Article 1659 of the Civil Code, PPC had the right to ask for (1) rescission of the Contract and indemnification for damages; or (2) only indemnification plus the continuation of the Contract. These two remedies were alternative, not cumulative, ruled the CA.\n\nAs PAGCOR had admitted its failure to pay the rentals for September to November 1993, PPC correctly exercised the option to terminate the lease agreement. Previously, the Contract remained effective, and PPC could collect the accrued rentals. However, from the time it terminated the Contract on November 25, 1993, PPC could no longer demand payment of the remaining rentals as part of actual damages, the CA added.\n\nDenying the claim for moral damages, the CA pointed out the failure of PPC to show that PAGCOR had acted in gross or evident bad faith in failing to pay the rentals from September to November 1993. Such failure was shown especially by the fact that PPC still had in hand three (3) months advance rental deposits of PAGCOR. The former could have simply applied this deposit to the unpaid rentals, as provided in the Contract. Neither did PPC adequately show that its reputation had been besmirched or the hotel's goodwill eroded by the establishment of the casino and the public protests.\n\nFinally, as to the claimed reimbursement for parking lot improvement, the CA held that PAGCOR had not presented official receipts to prove the latter's alleged expenses. The appellate court, however, upheld the trial court's award to PPC of P50,000 attorney's fees.\n\nHence this Petition. [6]\n\nIssues\n\nIn their Memorandum, petitioner raised the following issues:\n\"MAIN ISSUE:\n\n\"Did the Honorable Court of Appeals commit x x x grave and reversible error by holding that Pryce was not entitled to future rentals or lease payments for the unexpired period of the Contract of Lease between Pryce and PAGCOR?\n\n\"Sub-Issues:\n\n\"1. Were the provisions of Sections 20(a) and 20(c) of the Contract of Lease relative to the right of PRYCE to terminate the Contract for cause and to moreover collect rentals from PAGCOR corresponding to the remaining term of the lease valid and binding?\n\n\"2. Did not Article 1659 of the Civil Code supersede Sections 20(a) and 20(c) of the Contract, PRYCE having \"rescinded\" the Contract of Lease?\n\n\"3. Do the case of Rios, et al. vs. Jacinto Palma Enterprises, et al. and the other cases cited by PAGCOR support its position that PRYCE was not entitled to future rentals?\n\n\"4. Would the collection by PRYCE of future rentals not give rise to unjust enrichment?\n\n\"5. Could we not have \"harmonized\" Article 1659 of the Civil Code and Article 20 of the Contract of Lease?\n\n\"6. Is it not a basic rule that the law, i.e. Article 1659, is deemed written in contracts, particularly in the PRYCE-PAGCOR Contract of Lease?\" [7]\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Petition is partly meritorious.\n\nMain Issue:\nCollection of Remaining Rentals\n\nPPC anchors its right to collect future rentals upon the provisions of the Contract. Likewise, it argues that termination , as defined under the Contract, is different from the remedy of rescission prescribed under Article 1659 of the Civil Code. On the other hand, PAGCOR contends, as the CA ruled, that Article 1659 of the Civil Code governs; hence, PPC is allegedly no longer entitled to future rentals, because it chose to rescind the Contract.\n\nContract Provisions\nClear and Binding\n\nArticle 1159 of the Civil Code provides that \"obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.\" [8] In deference to the rights of the parties, the law [9] allows them to enter into stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions they may deem convenient; that is, as long as these are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy. Likewise, it is settled that if the terms of the contract clearly express the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of the stipulations would be controlling. [10]\n\nIn this case, Article XX of the parties' Contract of Lease provides in part as follows:\n\"XX. BREACH OR DEFAULT\n\n\"a) The LESSEE agrees that all the terms, conditions and/or covenants herein contained shall be deemed essential conditions of this contract, and in the event of default or breach of any of such terms, conditions and/or covenants, or should the LESSEE become bankrupt, or insolvent, or compounds with his creditors, the LESSOR shall have the right to terminate and cancel this contract by giving them fifteen (15 days) prior notice delivered at the leased premises or posted on the main door thereof. Upon such termination or cancellation, the LESSOR may forthwith lock the premises and exclude the LESSEE therefrom, forcefully or otherwise, without incurring any civil or criminal liability. During the fifteen (15) days notice, the LESSEE may prevent the termination of lease by curing the events or causes of termination or cancellation of the lease.\n\n\"b) x x x x x x x x x\n\n\"c) Moreover, the LESSEE shall be fully liable to the LESSOR for the rentals corresponding to the remaining term of the lease as well as for any and all damages, actual or consequential resulting from such default and termination of this contract.\n\n\"d) x x x x x x x x x.\" (Italics supplied)\nThe above provisions leave no doubt that the parties have covenanted 1) to give PPC the right to terminate and cancel the Contract in the event of a default or breach by the lessee; and 2) to make PAGCOR fully liable for rentals for the remaining term of the lease, despite the exercise of such right to terminate. Plainly, the parties have voluntarily bound themselves to require strict compliance with the provisions of the Contract by stipulating that a default or breach, among others, shall give the lessee the termination option, coupled with the lessor's liability for rentals for the remaining term of the lease.\n\nFor sure, these stipulations are valid and are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy. Neither is there anything objectionable about the inclusion in the Contract of mandatory provisions concerning the rights and obligations of the parties. [11] Being the primary law between the parties, it governs the adjudication of their rights and obligations. A court has no alternative but to enforce the contractual stipulations in the manner they have been agreed upon and written. [12] It is well to recall that courts, be they trial or appellate, have no power to make or modify contracts. [13] Neither can they save parties from disadvantageous provisions.\n\nTermination or Rescission?\n\nWell-taken is petitioner's insistence that it had the right to ask for \" termination plus the full payment of future rentals\" under the provisions of the Contract, rather than just rescission under Article 1659 of the Civil Code. This Court is not unmindful of the fact that termination and rescission are terms that have been used loosely and interchangeably in the past. But distinctions ought to be made, especially in this controversy, in which the terms mean differently and lead to equally different consequences.\n\nThe term \"rescission\" is found in 1) Article 1191 [14] of the Civil Code, the general provision on rescission of reciprocal obligations; 2) Article 1659, [15] which authorizes rescission as an alternative remedy, insofar as the rights and obligations of the lessor and the lessee in contracts of lease are concerned; and 3) Article 1380 [16] with regard to the rescission of contracts.\n\nIn his Concurring Opinion in Universal Food Corporation v. CA, [17] Justice J. B. L. Reyes differentiated rescission under Article 1191 from that under Article 1381 et seq. as follows:\n\"x x x. The rescission on account of breach of stipulations is not predicated on injury to economic interests of the party plaintiff but on the breach of faith by the defendant, that violates the reciprocity between the parties. It is not a subsidiary action, and Article 1191 may be scanned without disclosing anywhere that the action for rescission thereunder is subordinated to anything other than the culpable breach of his obligations to the defendant. This rescission is a principal action retaliatory in character, it being unjust that a party be held bound to fulfill his promises when the other violates his. As expressed in the old Latin aphorism: \" Non servanti fidem, non est fides servanda. \" Hence, the reparation of damages for the breach is purely secondary.\n\n\"On the contrary, in rescission by reason of lesion or economic prejudice, the cause of action is subordinated to the existence of that prejudice, because it is the raison d'etre as well as the measure of the right to rescind. x x x.\" [18]\nRelevantly, it has been pointed out that resolution was originally used in Article 1124 of the old Civil Code, and that the term became the basis for rescission under Article 1191 (and, conformably, also Article 1659). [19]\n\nNow, as to the distinction between termination (or cancellation ) and rescission (more properly, resolution ), Huibonhoa v. CA [20] held that, where the action prayed for the payment of rental arrearages, the aggrieved party actually sought the partial enforcement of a lease contract. Thus, the remedy was not rescission, but termination or cancellation, of the contract. The Court explained:\n\"x x x. By the allegations of the complaint, the Gojoccos' aim was to cancel or terminate the contract because they sought its partial enforcement in praying for rental arrearages. There is a distinction in law between cancellation of a contract and its rescission. To rescind is to declare a contract void in its inception and to put an end to it as though it never were. It is not merely to terminate it and release parties from further obligations to each other but to abrogate it from the beginning and restore the parties to relative positions which they would have occupied had no contract ever been made.\n\n\"x x x. The termination or cancellation of a contract would necessarily entail enforcement of its terms prior to the declaration of its cancellation in the same way that before a lessee is ejected under a lease contract, he has to fulfill his obligations thereunder that had accrued prior to his ejectment. However, termination of a contract need not undergo judicial intervention. x x x.\" [21] (Italics supplied)\nRescission has likewise been defined as the \"unmaking of a contract, or its undoing from the beginning, and not merely its termination. \" Rescission may be effected by both parties by mutual agreement; or unilaterally by one of them declaring a rescission of contract without the consent of the other, if a legally sufficient ground exists or if a decree of rescission is applied for before the courts. [22] On the other hand, termination refers to an \"end in time or existence; a close, cessation or conclusion.\" With respect to a lease or contract, it means an ending, usually before the end of the anticipated term of such lease or contract, that may be effected by mutual agreement or by one party exercising one of its remedies as a consequence of the default of the other. [23]\n\nThus, mutual restitution is required in a rescission (or resolution), in order to bring back the parties to their original situation prior to the inception of the contract. [24] Applying this principle to this case, it means that PPC would re-acquire possession of the leased premises, and PAGCOR would get back the rentals it paid the former for the use of the hotel space.\n\nIn contrast, the parties in a case of termination are not restored to their original situation; neither is the contract treated as if it never existed. Prior to its termination, the parties are obliged to comply with their contractual obligations. Only after the contract has been cancelled will they be released from their obligations.\n\nIn this case, the actions and pleadings of petitioner show that it never intended to rescind the Lease Contract from the beginning. This fact was evident when it first sought to collect the accrued rentals from September to November 1993 because, as previously stated, it actually demanded the enforcement of the Lease Contract prior to termination. Any intent to rescind was not shown, even when it abrogated the Contract on November 25, 1993, because such abrogation was not the rescission provided for under Article 1659.\n\nFuture Rentals\n\nAs to the remaining sub-issue of future rentals, R ios v. Jacinto [25] is inapplicable, because the remedy resorted to by the lessors in that case was rescission, not termination. The rights and obligations of the parties in R ios were governed by Article 1659 of the Civil Code; hence, the Court held that the damages to which the lessor was entitled could not have extended to the lessee's liability for future rentals.\n\nUpon the other hand, future rentals cannot be claimed as compensation for the use or enjoyment of another's property after the termination of a contract. We stress that by abrogating the Contract in the present case, PPC released PAGCOR from the latter's future obligations, which included the payment of rentals. To grant that right to the former is to unjustly enrich it at the latter's expense.\n\nHowever, it appears that Section XX (c) was intended to be a penalty clause. That fact is manifest from a reading of the mandatory provision under subparagraph (a) in conjunction with subparagraph (c) of the Contract. A penal clause is \"an accessory obligation which the parties attach to a principal obligation for the purpose of insuring the performance thereof by imposing on the debtor a special prestation (generally consisting in the payment of a sum of money) in case the obligation is not fulfilled or is irregularly or inadequately fulfilled.\" [26]\n\nQuite common in lease contracts, this clause functions to strengthen the coercive force of the obligation and to provide, in effect, for what could be the liquidated damages resulting from a breach. [27] There is nothing immoral or illegal in such indemnity/penalty clause, absent any showing that it was forced upon or fraudulently foisted on the obligor. [28]\n\nIn obligations with a penal clause, the general rule is that the penalty serves as a substitute for the indemnity for damages and the payment of interests in case of noncompliance; that is, if there is no stipulation to the contrary, [29] in which case proof of actual damages is not necessary for the penalty to be demanded. [30] There are exceptions to the aforementioned rule, however, as enumerated in paragraph 1 of Article 1226 of the Civil Code: 1) when there is a stipulation to the contrary, 2) when the obligor is sued for refusal to pay the agreed penalty, and 3) when the obligor is guilty of fraud. In these cases, the purpose of the penalty is obviously to punish the obligor for the breach. Hence, the obligee can recover from the former not only the penalty, but also other damages resulting from the nonfulfillment of the principal obligation. [31]\n\nIn the present case, the first exception applies because Article XX (c) provides that, aside from the payment of the rentals corresponding to the remaining term of the lease, the lessee shall also be liable \"for any and all damages, actual or consequential, resulting from such default and termination of this contract.\" Having entered into the Contract voluntarily and with full knowledge of its provisions, PAGCOR must be held bound to its obligations. It cannot evade further liability for liquidated damages.\n\nReduction of Penalty\n\nIn certain cases, a stipulated penalty may nevertheless be equitably reduced by the courts. [32] This power is explicitly sanctioned by Articles 1229 and 2227 of the Civil Code, which we quote:\n\"Art. 1229. The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable.\"\n\n\"Art. 2227. Liquidated damages, whether intended as an indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably reduced if they are iniquitous or unconscionable.\"\nThe question of whether a penalty is reasonable or iniquitous is addressed to the sound discretion of the courts. To be considered in fixing the amount of penalty are factors such as -- but not limited to -- the type, extent and purpose of the penalty; the nature of the obligation; the mode of the breach and its consequences; the supervening realities; the standing and relationship of the parties; and the like. [33]\n\nIn this case, PAGCOR's breach was occasioned by events that, although not fortuitous in law, were in fact real and pressing. From the CA's factual findings, which are not contested by either party, we find that PAGCOR conducted a series of negotiations and consultations before entering into the Contract. It did so not only with the PPC, but also with local government officials, who assured it that the problems were surmountable. Likewise, PAGCOR took pains to contest the ordinances [34] before the courts, which consequently declared them unconstitutional. On top of these developments, the gaming corporation was advised by the Office of the President to stop the games in Cagayan de Oro City, prompting the former to cease operations prior to September 1993.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the CA's finding that PAGCOR's casino operations had to be suspended for days on end since their start in December 1992; and indefinitely from July 15, 1993, upon the advice of the Office of President, until the formal cessation of operations in September 1993. Needless to say, these interruptions and stoppages meant that PAGCOR suffered a tremendous loss of expected revenues, not to mention the fact that it had fully operated under the Contract only for a limited time.\n\nWhile petitioner's right to a stipulated penalty is affirmed, we consider the claim for future rentals to the tune of P7,037,835.40 to be highly iniquitous. The amount should be equitably reduced. Under the circumstances , the advanced rental deposits in the sum of P687,289.50 should be sufficient penalty for respondent's breach.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED in part. The assailed Decision and Resolution are hereby MODIFIED to include the payment of penalty. Accordingly, respondent is ordered to pay petitioner the additional amount of P687,289.50 as penalty, which may be set off or applied against the former's advanced rental deposits. Meanwhile, the CA's award to petitioner of actual damages representing the accrued rentals for September to November 1993 -- with interest and penalty at the rate of two percent (2%) per month, from the date of filing of the Complaint until the amount shall have been fully paid -- as well as the P50,000 award for attorney's fees, is AFFIRMED . No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nSandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 39-85.\n\n[2] Id., pp. 88-106. Sixth Division. Penned by Justice Sergio L.

RODRIGUEZ, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N\nSPOUSES ANTONIO VIZARRA AND BRENDA LOGATOC VIZARRA, TOMAS VIZARRA, JESUS PASTORAL, AND MIGUEL RICAFRANCA, PETITIONERS, VS. CONCHITA R. RODRIGUEZ AND EVELYN R. RODRIGUEZ, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nIn this Petition for Review on Certiorari [1] under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, petitioners assail the Decision [2] dated 30 April 2001 of the Court of Appeals, Eighth Division, in CA-G.R. CV No. 38286 which affirmed in toto the Decision [3] dated 27 July 1991 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Marinduque, Branch 38, in Civil Case No. 84-2.\n\nThe antecedent facts involve two separate cases principally involving the sameparcels of land and the same parties or their predecessors-in-interest. The first case, terminated way back in 1977, involved an action for recovery of possession of real property where it was eventually ruled that respondent Conchita R. Rodriguez (Conchita) is the owner of a parcel of land located in Bangwain, Torrijos, Marinduque, one of the subject properties of this petition. The second case, now before us for review, concerns a subsequent trial court decision, rendered in 1991, and enjoining petitioners from appropriating the fruits thereof, otherwise exercising acts of ownership over the land previously awarded to Conchita and another property owned in common by respondents and which was usurped by petitioners. [4] Said decision likewise nullified a purported sale of the subject parcels of land in favor of petitioners. It is the incidents surrounding this sale, arising as it did from a levy and auction by the Provincial Assessor of Marinduque for non-payment of real property taxes, that provide this petition with some academic interest.\n\nThe details follow.\n\nThe first case stemmed from a Complaint [5] filed on 31 August 1962 before the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Boac, Marinduque by Manuel Vizarra (Manuel) against Conchita. The complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 1245, was for recovery of possession of real property. Manuel narrated in his complaint that he was the owner of an unregistered parcel of land located at Barrio Bangwain, Torrijos, Marinduque. At the time of the institution of the complaint, the subject lot had not yet been surveyed but the alleged boundaries were embodied in Tax Declaration No. 5206 in his name. [6]\n\nManuel further asserted that in 1937, he and Conchita's late husband, Atty. Clemente Rodriguez (Atty. Rodriguez), allegedly entered into a bilateral written agreement allowing the latter to enter the land for purposes of locating mineral deposits therein. Subsequently, but prior to the Japanese occupation period, Atty. Rodriguez had started to raise cattle on the western portion of the land instead, and had even constructed a fence on the southern side of Manuel's land. Atty. Rodriguez died during the Japanese occupation, but his widow illicitly retained possession of the land and appropriated the fruits of the fruit-bearing trees. [7]\n\nAnswering the complaint, Conchita asserted ownership over the 57,000 square meter (sq. m.) property, which was then covered by Tax Declaration No. 4570 [8] in the name of her deceased father, Vicente Rosales. She added that on 12 April 1950, Manuel had ceased to be the lawful owner of most of the land described in Tax Declaration No. 5206 [9] when he voluntarily subdivided the land described under Tax Declaration No. 5206 between him and his seven (7) children, [10] who were then in possession of their respective shares of the land. [11]\n\nThe dispute was referred by the CFI to court-appointed commissioners who then submitted a report ascertaining, among others, that the boundaries of the land were:\nOn the northern part of the land is the property of Manuel Vizarra, on the West-brook; East Brook and on the South is Bangwain river. [12] That particular conclusion proved material to the disposition of the first complaint. For on 19 November 1963, Manuel caused the consolidation of the eight (8) tax declarations of the Vizarras into a single Tax Declaration No. 8494 in his name. Notably, the boundaries as stated in the new tax declaration were different from those ascertained by the commissioners. [13]\n\nOn 16 November 1977, the CFI of Marinduque ruled in favor of Conchita, finding that the latter was indeed the true owner of the disputed land. The CFI noted the disparity of the boundaries of the tax declarations Manuel initially presented in court and, how by \"sleigh-of-the-hand improvisation,\" the location of the land, as indicated in the 1963 tax declaration, was changed in order to encompass Conchita's property. [14]\n\nAfter the decision of the CFI became final and executory, a writ of execution, [15] and, subsequently, an alias writ of execution [16] were issued ordering petitioners to refrain from entering the disputed property. In the interim, Manuel died and was substituted by his heirs, including the present petitioners.\n\nThen in 1984, Conchita, joined by her daughter Evelyn, filed an action for injunction and damages with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction before the RTC of Boac, Marinduque, Branch 38. The second case, docketed as Civil Case No. 84-2, saw respondents asserting absolute ownership over two (2) parcels of land, [17] one of which was the subject property in the first case, located at Bangwain, Torrijos, Marinduque. Even as Conchita's ownership was acknowledged by the CFI in the 1977 decision over one of the parcels of land, it was alleged that petitioners, along with twenty other persons, repeatedly entered the subject properties, harvested coconuts to be processed into copra and appropriated the fruits to themselves. [18]\n\nPetitioners, on the other hand, narrated that the subject properties were actually purchased by petitioner spouses Antonio and Brenda Vizarra from the provincial government of Marinduque in a public auction sale conducted on 24 April 1979, which became final one year after. They presented in court the Final Bill of Sale executed on 14 May 1980, evidencing their claim over the subject properties. [19] It appeared that the auction sale was conducted at the instance of the Provincial Assessor of Marinduque, for real estate tax delinquency. Interestingly, the auction sale resulted from the failure of Manuel to pay the real property taxes, even though the CFI had ruled that it was Conchita Rodriguez who had actually owned one of the subject properties. [20]\n\nOn 27 July 1991, the RTC rendered its assailed decision, finding that the parcels of land in dispute were owned by respondent Conchita. In doing so, it established the following scenario:\n\n(a) In 1963, Manuel subdivided the property described in Tax Declaration No. 5206 into eight (8) unequal parts, between himself and his children. Afterwards, but prior to the rendition of the CFI decision in 1977, Manuel consolidated anew the subdivided properties into one tax declaration (Tax Declaration No. 8494).The boundaries as stated in this new tax declaration, however. had been altered to encompass the properties of Conchita, Parcel No. I, subject of Civil Case No. 1245, and Parcel No. II. [21]\n\n(b) Tax Declaration No. 8494 was later replaced by Tax Declaration No. 195 and subsequently, Tax Declaration No. 176, all in Manuel's name, and again improperly encompassing Conchita's properties. Manuel did not pay for the taxes on the properties subject of the tax declarations, prompting the provincial government of Marinduque to send notices of auction sale to sell the lot under Tax Declaration No. 176. The properties were then purchased at the auction sale by petitioners Antonio and Brenda Vizarra (Brenda), Antonio being a grandson of Manuel. [22]\n\n(c) However, the properties covered by Tax Declaration No. 176 and subsequently sold on auction by the provincial government include the same property which the CFI had determined in 1977 as that of Conchita Rodriguez. Moreover, the same property and the other property also subject of this case were declared in the name of Conchita's daughter, Evelyn, in Tax Declaration No. 10178 and Tax Declaration No. 9792. [23] The RTC considered the foregoing as an indicium of the bad faith attending the acts of Manuel and petitioners in seeking to obtain ownership over the subject properties.\n\nPetitioners appealed the RTC Decision to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals agreed with the conclusions and affirmed in toto the judgment of the RTC. Hence, this petition.\n\nPetitioners come before the Court questioning essentially the findings of facts of both RTC and CA on the ownership of the subject parcels of land. Petitioners maintain that the land they entered were not the properties of Conchita and aver that they had bought the same in good faith.\n\nBrenda likewise admits having received two (2) notices of delinquency sale of different dates\u2013the first one addressed to her husband Antonio Vizarra (Antonio) and Concepcion Rodriguez (referring to respondent Conchita), in the alternative; and the second notice addressed to her uncle, Antero Vizarra (Antero) and Concepcion Rodriguez, in the alternative. However, she states that the respondents did not forward the notices to Conchita Rodriguez in the belief that the latter was furnished copies of the same by the provincial assessor's office. It is further claimed that petitioners had consulted Atty. Eduardo Mirafuente (Atty. Mirafuente), the CFI clerk of court, regarding the propriety of bidding therein. Atty. Mirafuente had said that the property to be auctioned off covered the same land litigated in Civil Case No. 1245, but he nonetheless gave them the go-signal to participate in the bidding. [24]\n\nAs a rule, questions of facts are not to be entertained in this jurisdiction. Both the RTC and the Court of Appeals are in agreement as to the particulars of the case. In such a circumstance, the rule is that their findings on the facts will not be disturbed. [25] The Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the re-examination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during the trial of the case considering that the findings of facts of the Court of Appeals are conclusive and binding on the Court. [26]\n\nThe fundamental issue of this case concerns the identity of the land in dispute. Petitioners would have us believe that the land they had bought at the auction sale did not cover the same land that the CFI of Marinduque adjudicated to respondent Conchita way back in 1977.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded.\n\nThe evidence on record reveals that the questioned auction sale included the land adjudicated to respondent Conchita by the CFI of Marinduque in Civil Case 1245.\n\nNotably, before the CFI, Manuel, petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, presented two apparently different and conflicting tax declaration certificates i.e. , Tax Declaration Nos. 5206 and 8494 bearing totally different boundaries. The CFI of Marinduque had observed in its ruling that this was part of Manuel's scheme to acquire the ownership of a parcel of land which did not belong to him. The CFI decision, not having been contested by Manuel or his heirs, has long become final and executory and is thus binding and conclusive on the petitioners with regard to the ownership of Parcel No. I. [27]\n\nPetitioners attempted once more to take the same property when they were furnished a copy of the notice of delinquency sale by the provincial assessor's office of the land in question and Parcel No. II both covered by Tax Declaration No. 176. In evident bad faith Brenda admitted in open court that Antero did not want to pay the delinquency tax as the land included therein, denominated as Parcel No. I, had already been adjudicated to Conchita. Petitioners Antonio and Brenda had known that they bid for the land owned by Conchita and that it was undeniably the land subject of Civil Case No. 1245 which was adjudicated to Conchita. Brenda herself testified as follows:\nQ: And your uncle Antero Vizarra also told you that he is not interested in paying the back taxes because that portion of the land of Manuel Vizarra was lost to Conchita Rodriguez or Concepcion Rodriguez in Civil Case No. 1245 and that Mrs.Rodriguez is in possession of the land publicly and that she should pay the taxes, do you remember having told Antero in that manner?\n\nA: My uncle told me that they would not pay the taxes because they lost the case to Mrs. Rodriguez, sir. And the possession of the property was in the hands of Mrs. Rodriguez.\n\nQ: And because of those inquiry of Atty. Mirafuente, it was clear to your mind that the subject matter of the auction sale is that property which was lost to Conchita Rodriguez in Civil Case No. 1245, is it not?\nA: Yes, sir. [28] Moreover, by Brenda's own admission, the addressees of the first letter sent by the provincial assessor's office were her husband, Antonio Vizarra and Concepcion Rodriguez, in the alternative. The second notice of delinquency was also telling. It was addressed this time to Antero Vizarra and in the alternative, Concepcion Rodriguez. Thus, by the act of sending the notices of delinquency sale to the two parties, the provincial assessor of Marinduque recognized that there was a single parcel of land claimed by two persons. The only explanation why the provincial assessor sent the notice to the two addressees was he was unsure as to who between the two addressees was the owner of the land. [29]\n\nParenthetically, when the provincial assessor failed to serve a separate notice to Conchita \u2013 the true and lawful owner \u2013 that her land was to be auctioned off due to non-payment of real estate taxes, he violated Section 73 [30] of Presidential Decree No. 464, otherwise known as the Real Property Tax Code, which provides that a copy of the notice shall forthwith be sent by registered mail, or by messenger or through the barrio captain to the delinquent taxpayer, at his address shown on the tax record cards or at his residence. The auction sale, therefore, was null and void for non-compliance with the provisions of the Real Property Tax Code on mandatory notice. [31]\n\nIn any event, the auctioneer in an auction sale does not warrant that the buyer shall,from the time of the sale, have and enjoy the legal and peaceful possession of the property sold. [32]\n\nWe agree with the findings of the Court of Appeals that there was indeed bad faithimputable to the petitioners. In ruling so, the Court of Appeals said:\nThe general picture of this case readily shows the bad faith of the defendant-appellees' right from the very start when Manuel Vizarra unscrupulouslysub-divided and re-consolidated ownership of the property through various tax declarations together with the unexplained non-payment of real estate tax due thereon. Along with this, there is the RTC's finding that the defendants-appellants did not give the notice of the delinquency sale to the plaintiffs-appellees despite their knowledge that the property of the plaintiffs-appellees were about to be auctioned off. Finally, the fact that during the public auction sale, there was only one bidder, which by no coincidence happened to be Antonio Vizarra, there could be no clearer showing of defendants-appellants bad faith in purchasing the said property. [33] Good faith, or the lack of it, is, in the last analysis, a question of intention. But in ascertaining the intention by which one is actuated on a given occasion, courts are necessarily controlled by the evidence as to the conduct and outward acts by which the inward may, with safety, be determined. So it is that \"the honesty of intention,\" \"the honest lawful intent,\" which constitutes good faith implies a \"freedom from knowledge and circumstances which ought to put a person on inquiry.\" [34]\n\nIn this case, there was clearly bad faith in the purported acquisition of petitioner spouses Antonio and Brenda Vizarra of the subject properties. Petitioners went to great lengths in a bid to mislead this Court and the lower courts that the parcels of land they now have title to were not the properties of Conchita. But they slipped in one instance as they admitted that the properties they purchased at the auction sale included the same land that their grandfather lost to Conchita in Civil Case No. 1245.\n\nWe disagree, however, with the pronouncement of the RTC and the Court of Appeals that petitioners had the obligation to convey the notice of delinquency to respondents. Rather, the responsibility lies with the provincial assessor's office to furnish copies of the notices to the parties concerned. Thus, the provincial assessor should have given a copy of the two (2) notices of delinquency sale to Conchita. Absent any ample evidence that the provincial assessor did so and that he observed the requisites set out in Section 73 [35] of Presidential Decree No. 464, the auction sale of the disputed parcels of land is truly null and void for non-observance of the statutory requirement of the Real Property Tax Code.\n\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, the Court finds that the award of the RTC and the Court of Appeals for actual and compensatory damages improper.\n\nRespondent Conchita stated in open court that petitioners entered the subject property everytime the harvest of coconuts are due. She further claimed that in 1979, the year before petitioners entered the land and appropriated to themselves the fruits thereof, the harvest of the land was not less than 2,000 kilos. She also testified on the amount of money that could be yielded from the harvest from 1980 to 1986. [36]\n\nThe claims, however, are markedly self-serving, with nary a document to support them.\n\nThe rule is that evidence should be taken of the damages claimed and the court should determine who are entitled to such indemnity. The power of courts to grant damages and attorney's fees demands factual, legal and equitable justifications, its basis cannot be left to speculation or conjecture. [37]\n\nHowever, there is no question that respondents suffered pecuniary loss due to the acts of petitioners and thus, respondents are entitled to damages. As borne out by the records of the case, petitioners have continuously entered the land and appropriated the fruits to themselves to the prejudice of the rightful owner from 20 May 1980 to the present. [38] Hence, it is but equitable that respondents be remunerated for their loss of the earnings due to the acts of petitioners. Since there is no sufficient evidence to prove actual and compensatory damages, the Court hereby awards temperate damages instead, which are more than nominal but less than compensatory damages, considering that respondent had indeed suffered some pecuniary loss but the amount cannot be proved with certainty. [39] The amount of P90,000.00 is sufficient and reasonable under the circumstances. In consonance therewith, the award of nominal damages is hereby deleted.\n\nThe Court also cancels the award for moral damages as there was no indication that respondents had suffered emotional hurt and injury.\n\nFinding bad faith and fraudulent acts on the part of petitioners, the Court hereby imposes an increased amount of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated 30 April 2001 of the Court of Appeals, Eighth Division, in CA-G.R. CV No. 38286 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows:\nThe award of nominal and moral damages is hereby DELETED;\n\nPetitioners are ordered to jointly and severally pay respondents P90,000.00 as temperate damages, in lieu of the award of actual and compensatory damages which is hereby DELETED;\n\nPetitioners are likewise ordered to jointly and severally pay respondents P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.\nCosts against petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio-Morales, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 20-38; Dated 22 June 2001.\n\n[2] Id. at 9-16.

NO. 147566, December 06, 2006 ]\n\nSAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND RAFAEL MALIKS RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nSAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND RAFAEL MALIKS RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nIn this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitioner San Miguel Corporation (SMC) seeks the reversal and setting aside of the Decision [1] dated September 30, 1999 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 50321 , as reiterated in its Resolution [2] of March 20, 2001, affirming in toto an earlier decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR CA No. 005478-93, entitled \"Rafael C. Maliksi v. San Miguel Corporation and/or Philippine Software Services & Education Center.\" The affirmed NLRC decision overturned that of the Labor Arbiter and declared the herein private respondent Rafael Maliksi (Maliksi) a regular employee of the petitioner and ordered the latter to reinstate him with benefits.\n\nAs found by the NLRC and subsequently adopted by the CA, the facts are as follows:\nOn 16 October 1990, Rafael M. Maliksi filed a complaint against the San Miguel Corporation-Magnolia Division, herein referred to as SMC and Philippine Software Services and Education Center herein referred to as PHILSSEC to compel the said respondents to recognize him as a regular employee. He amended the complaint on 12 November 1990 to include the charge of illegal dismissal because his services were terminated on 31 October 1990.\n\nThe complainant's employment record indicates that he rendered service with Lipercon Services from 1 April 1981 to February 1982 as budget head assigned to SMC-Beer Division, then from July 1983 to April 1985 with Skillpower, Inc., as accounting clerk assigned to SMC-Magnolia Division, then from October 1988 to 1989 also with Skillpower, Inc. as acting clerk assigned to SMC-Magnolia Finance, and from October 1989 to 31 October 1990 with PHILSSEC assigned to Magnolia Finance as accounting clerk. The complainant considered himself as an employee of SMC-Magnolia. Lipercon Services, Skillpower, Inc. and PHILSSEC are labor-only contractors and any one of which had never been his employer. His dismissal, according to him, was in retaliation for his filing of the complaint for regularization in service. His dismissal was illegal there being no just cause for the action. He was not accorded due process neither was his dismissal reported to the Department of Labor and Employment.\n\nPHILSSEC disclaimed liability. As an entity catering (sic) computer systems and program for business enterprises, it has contracted with SMC-Magnolia to computerize the latter's manual accounting reporting systems of its provincial sales. PHILSSEC then conducted a three phase analysis of SMC\u2013Magnolia set up: first the computer needs of the firm was (sic) determined; then, the development of computer systems or program suitable; and, finally, set up the systems and train the employees to operate the same. In all these phases, PHILSSEC uses its computer system and technology and provided the necessary manpower to compliment the transfer of the technology to SMC-Magnolia. Complainant Maliksi was one of those employed by PHILSSEC whose principal function was the manual control of data needed during the computerization. Like all assigned to the project, the complainant's work was controlled by PHILSSEC supervisors, his salary paid by the agency and he reported directly to PHILSSEC. The computerization project was completed on 31 October 1990, and so, the complainant was terminated on the said date.\n\nSMC, on the other hand, submitted its position. In the contract SMC entered with PHILSSEC, the latter undertook to set up the computerization of the provincial sales reporting system of Magnolia Division. To carry out the task, PHILSSEC utilized 3 computer programmers and the rest were data encoders. The complainant being one of the compliments (sic) performed the following functions:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nSMC likewise contends that PHILSSEC exercised exclusive managerial prerogative over the complainant as to hiring, payment of salary, dismissal and most importantly, the control over his work. SMC was interested only in the result of the work specified in the contract but not as to the means and methods of accomplishing the same. Moreover, PHILSSEC has substantial capital of its own. It has an IBM system, 3 computers, 17 IBM or IBM-compatible computers; it has a building where the computer training center and main office are located. What it markets to clients are computer programs and training systems on computer technology and not the usual labor or manpower supply to establishment concerns. Moreover, what PHILSSEC set up employing the complainant, among others, has no relation to the principal business of SMC, which is food and beverage. It was a single relationship between the people utilized by PHILSSEC and SMC...' [3] The Labor Arbiter declared Maliksi a regular employee of PHILSSEC and absolved SMC from liability. Dispositively, the Labor Arbiter's decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the complainant, Rafael Maliksi, is recognized as a regular employee of Philippine Software Services and Education Center which respondent is ordered to reinstate him to a job of the same level as his previous position in any of the projects where there is a vacancy and without loss of seniority rights. A five months backwages is awarded because the prolonged suspension from his work was brought about by his refusal to take any job offered by PHILSSEC earlier in the proceedings of this case. The respondent, SMC-Magnolia Division, is exempted from any liability as the complaint against the said corporation is dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [4] Maliksi appealed to the NLRC. In turn, in a decision dated January 26, 1998, the NLRC reversed that of the Labor Arbiter by declaring Maliksi a regular employee of the petitioner and ordering the latter to reinstate him without loss of seniority rights and with full benefits, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, as recommended, the decision below is hereby SET ASIDE. Accordingly, judgment is hereby rendered directing respondent SMC-Magnolia Division to reinstate complainant as a regular employee without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to pay complainant full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent, computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to time of his actual reinstatement, plus 10% of the total money award for and attorney's fees.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5] From the aforementioned decision of the NLRC, SMC went on certiorari to the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 50321 .\n\nAs stated at the outset, the CA, in the herein assailed Decision [6] dated September 30, 1999, affirmed in toto that of the NLRC. In so doing, the CA found SMC to have utilized PHILSSEC, Lipercon Services, Inc. (Lipercon) and Skillpower, Inc. (Skillpower) as conduits to circumvent Article 280 of the Labor Code, employing Maliksi as contractual or project employee through these entities, thereby undermining his right to gain regular employment status under the law. The appellate court echoed the NLRC's assessment that Maliksi's work was necessary or desirable in the business of SMC in its Magnolia Division, for more than the required one-year period. It affirmed the NLRC's finding that the three (3) conduit entities adverted to, Lipercon and Skillpower, are labor-only contractors such that Maliksi's previous employment contracts with SMC, through these two entities, are deemed to have been entered into in violation of labor laws. Consequently, Maliksi's employment with SMC became permanent and regular after the statutory period of one year of service through these entities. The CA concluded that on account of his past employment contracts with SMC under Lipercon and Skillpower, Maliksi was already a regular employee of SMC when he entered into SMC's computerization project as part of the PHILSSEC project complement.\n\nWith its motion for reconsideration having been denied by the CA in its Resolution of March 20, 2001, SMC is now with this Court via the present recourse on the following assigned errors:\nI\n\nThe Court of Appeals gravely erred in declaring private respondent a regular employee of petitioner SMC despite its findings that PHILSSEC, the contractor that employed private respondent, is an independent job contractor.\n\nCorollarily, the declaration of the Honorable Court of Appeals that private respondent is a regular employee of petitioner SMC proceeds from the erroneous premise that private respondent was already a regular employee of SMC when he was hired by the independent contractor PHILSSEC. Having been placed in petitioner SMC by a supposed labor-only contractor, for just five months and for a different job, three years after his last assignment therein, private respondent had not thereby become a regular employee of petitioner SMC.\n\nII\n\nThe Court of Appeals gravely erred in ultimately resolving the case upon the principle that \"all doubts must be resolved in favor of labor\"; certainly, protection to labor does not imply sanctioning a plain injustice to the employer, particularly where private respondent was shown to have stated falsehoods and committed malicious intercalations and misrepresentations.\n\nIII\n\nThe Court of Appeals gravely erred in declaring that private respondent was not part of the of the personnel group in the computerization program of petitioner SMC under PHILSSEC. We DENY .\n\nSMC concedes that Maliksi, before his employment with PHILSSEC, worked in SMC from November 1988 to April 1990 , but as employee of Skillpower [7] and that he was previously assigned to SMC between 1981 up to February 1985 , \"for periods spread apart.\" [8] The Labor Arbiter found, as earlier stated, that Maliksi rendered service with Lipercon from 1 April 1981 to February 1982 as budget head assigned to SMC-Beer Division; from July 1983 to April 1985 with Skillpower as accounting clerk assigned to SMC-Magnolia Division, then from October 1988 to 1989 [9] also with Skillpower as acting clerk assigned to SMC-Magnolia Finance, and from October 1989 to 31 October 1990 with PHILSSEC assigned to Magnolia Finance as accounting clerk . In all, it appears that, while under the employ of either Lipercon or Skillpower, Maliksi has undisputedly rendered service with SMC for at least three years and seven months . [10]\n\nThe Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Lipercon and Skillpower were declared to be labor-only contractors, [11] providing as they do manpower services to the public for a fee. The existence of an employer-employee relationship is factual and we give due deference to the factual findings of both the NLRC and the CA that an employer-employee relationship existed between SMC (or its subsidiaries) and Maliksi. Indeed, having served SMC for an aggregate period of more than three (3) years through employment contracts with these two labor contractors, Maliksi should be considered as SMC's regular employee. The hard fact is that he was hired and re-hired by SMC to perform administrative and clerical work that was necessary to SMC's business on a daily basis. In Bustamante v. National Labor Relations Commission , [12] we ruled:\nIn the case at bar, petitioners were employed at various periods from 1985 to 1989 for the same kind of work they were hired to perform in September 1989. Both the labor arbiter and the respondent NLRC agree that petitioners were employees engaged to perform activities necessary in the usual business of the employer . As laborers, harvesters or sprayers in an agricultural establishment which produces high grade bananas, petitioners' tasks are indispensable to the year-round operations of respondent company. This belies the theory of respondent company that the employment of petitioners was terminated due to the expiration of their probationary period in June 1990. If at all significant, the contract for probationary employment was utilized by respondent company as a chicanery to deny petitioners their status as regular employees and to evade paying them the benefits attached to such status. Some of the petitioners were hired as far back as 1985, although the hiring was not continuous. They were hired and re-hired in a span of from two to four years to do the same type of work which conclusively shows the necessity of petitioners' service to the respondent company's business. Petitioners have, therefore, become regular employees after performing activities which are necessary in the usual business of their employer. But, even assuming that the activities of petitioners in respondent company's plantation were not necessary or desirable to its business, we affirm the public respondent's finding that all of the complainants (petitioners) have rendered non-continuous or broken service for more than one (1) year and are consequently considered regular employees.\n\nWe do not sustain public respondent's theory that private respondent should not be made to compensate petitioners for backwages because its termination of their employment was not made in bad faith. The act of hiring and re-hiring the petitioners over a period of time without considering them as regular employees evidences bad faith on the part of private respondent. The public respondent made a finding to this effect when it stated that the subsequent re-hiring of petitioners on a probationary status \"clearly appears to be a convenient subterfuge on the part of management to prevent complainants (petitioners) from becoming regular employees.\" (Emphasis supplied) It is worth noting that, except for the computerization project of PHILSSEC, petitioner did not make any insinuation at all that the services of Maliksi with SMC was project-related such that an employment contract with Lipercon and Skillpower was necessary.\n\nIn Madriaga v. Court of Appeals , [13] the Court, confronted with the same issue now being addressed, declared that regularization of employment in SMC should extend to those whose situation is similar to the complainants in said case. We wrote:\nThis is the third time that the parties have invoked the power of this Court to decide the labor dispute involved in this case. The generative facts of the case are as follows:\nOn 04 March 1988, the NOWM and a number of workers-complainants filed with the Arbitration Branch of the NCR, NLRC, Manila, against San Miguel Corporation, Philippine Dairy Products Corporation, Magnolia Dairy Products, Skillpower Corporation and Lipercon Services, Inc . for illegal dismissal.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a decision on 29 July 1988, the dispositive of which states:\n\nWHEREFORE, it is hereby declared that complainants are regular employees of SMC and PDPC. Accordingly, SMC and PDPC are hereby ordered to reinstate the dismissed 85 complainants to their former positions as their regular employees effective from the date of the filing of their complaints with full backwages less the daily financial assistance of P30.00 per day each, extended to them by Lipercon and Skillpower. Aggrieved by the said decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator, SMC and PDPC filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court.\n\nIt was upon the filing of the said petition for certiorari that the Court had the first opportunity to pass upon the controversies involved in this case. In a Resolution dated 30 August 1989, the Court dismissed G.R. No. 85577 entitled, \"Philippine Dairy Products Corporation and San Miguel Corporation \u2013 Magnolia Dairy Products Division v. Voluntary Arbitrator Tito F. Genilo of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the National Organization of Workingmen (NOWM)\" for lack of merit. The Court held in full :\nIndividual private respondents are xxx [SMC, et al.] laborers supplied to petitioners by Skillpower Corporation and Lipercon Services, Inc. , on the basis of contracts of services. Upon expiration of the said contracts, individual private respondents were denied entry to petitioners' premises. Individual private respondents and respondent union thus filed separate complaints for illegal dismissal against petitioners San Miguel Corp., Skillpower Corporation and Lipercon Services, Inc., in the [NLRC, NCR] After consolidation and voluntary arbitration, respondent Labor Arbiter Tito F. Genilo rendered a decision xxx declaring individual private respondents regular employees of petitioners and ordering the latter to reinstate the former and to pay them backwages. On motion for execution filed by private respondents, Labor Arbiter Genilo issued on October 20, 1988 an order directing, among others, the regularization of \"all the complainants which include those still working and those already terminated.\" Hence, this petition for certiorari with injunction.\n\nPetitioners contend that prior to reinstatement, individual private respondents should first comply with certain requirements, like submission of NBI and police clearances and submission to physical and medical examinations, since petitioners are deemed to be direct employers and have the right to ascertain the physical fitness and moral uprightness of its employees by requiring the latter to undergo periodic examinations, and that petitioners may not be ordered to employ on regular basis the other workers rendering services to petitioners by virtue of a similar contract of services between petitioners and Skillpower Corporation and Lipercon Services, Inc. because such other workers were not parties to or were not impleaded in the voluntary arbitration case .\n\nConsidering that the clearances and examinations sought by petitioners from private respondents are not 'periodic' in nature but are made preconditions for reinstatement, as in fact the petition filed alleged that reinstatement shall be effective upon compliance with such requirements, (pp. 5-6 thereof) which should not be the case because this is not a case of initial hiring, the workers concerned having rendered years of service to petitioners who are considered direct employers, and that regularization is a labor benefit that should apply to all qualified employees similarly situated and may not be denied merely because some employees were allegedly not parties to or were not impleaded in the voluntary arbitration case, even as the finding of Labor Arbiter Genilo is to the contrary, this Court finds no grave abuse of discretion committed by Labor Arbiter Genilo in issuing the questioned order of October 20, 1988 .\n\nACCORDINGLY, the Court Resolved to Dismiss the petition for lack of merit.\nIn fine, the Court affirmed the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrator and declared that therein complainants are regular employees of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and PDPC. It must be noted that in the abovequoted Resolution, the Court extended the benefit of regularization not only to the original complainants but also to those workers who are \"similarly situated\" to therein complainants. Herein petitioners are among those who are \"similarly situated.\" [14] (Emphasis supplied) We find respondent Maliksi to be similarly situated with those of the complainants in Madriaga . Indeed, Lipercon and Skillpower have figured in not just a few of our decisions, [15] so much so that we are inclined to believe that these two were involved in labor-only contracting with respect to Maliksi. We hold that the finding of the NLRC and the CA as to SMC's resorting to labor-only contracting is entitled to consideration in its full weight.\n\nWith respect to PHILSSEC, there was no need for Maliksi to be employed under the former's computerization program to be considered a regular employee of SMC at the time. Moreover, SMC itself admits that Maliksi's work under the computerization program did \"not require the operation of a computer system, such as the software program being developed by PHILSSEC.\" [16] Given this admission, we are simply at a loss to understand why Maliksi should be included in the computerization project as a project employee. Not being a computer expert, Maliksi's inclusion in the project was uncalled for. To our mind, his placement in the project was for the purpose of circumventing labor laws. The evidence shows that immediately before he entered the PHILSSEC project in October 1989, Maliksi was fresh out of his employment with SMC (through Skillpower) as acting clerk assigned to SMC-Magnolia Finance (from October 1988 to 1989).\n\nMaliksi's work under the PHILSSEC project was mainly administrative in nature and necessary to the development of SMC's business. These were:\nposting manually the daily account balances in the workset;\n\nfitting the daily totals into the monthly totals;\n\ncomparing the manual totals with the computer generated totals;\n\nlocating the differences between the totals; and,\n\nadjusting and correcting errors. Simply put, the data gathered by SMC on a daily basis through Maliksi's work would be submitted for analysis and evaluation, thereby allowing SMC to make the necessary business decisions that would enable it to market its products better, or monitor its sales and collection with efficiency. Without the data gatherer or encoder, no analysis could occur. SMC would then, for the most part, be kept in the dark.\n\nAs to the petitioner's second assigned error, we hold that there is no need to resolve the present case under the principle that all doubts should be resolved in favor of the workingman. The perceived doubt does not obtain in the first place.\n\nWe understand Maliksi's desperation in making his point clear to SMC, which unduly refuses to acknowledge his status as a regular employee. Instead, he was juggled from one employment contract to another in a continuous bid to circumvent labor laws. The act of hiring and re-hiring workers over a period of time without considering them as regular employees evidences bad faith on the part of the employer. [17] Where, from the circumstances, it is apparent that periods have been imposed to preclude the acquisition of tenurial security by the employee, the policy, agreement or practice should be struck down as contrary to public policy, morals, good customs or public order. [18] In point of law, any person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall be liable for the damage. [19]\n\nWays and means contrived by employers to countermand labor laws granting regular employment status to their workers are numerous and long. For instance, they toss the poor workers from one job contractor to another, make them go through endless applications, lining up, paperwork, documentation, and physical examinations; make them sign five- or ten-month-only job contracts, yet re-hire them after brief \"rest periods,\" but not after requiring them to go through the whole application and selection process once again; prepare and have them sign waivers, quitclaims, and the like; refuse to issue them identification cards, receipts or any other concrete proof of employment or documentary proof of payment of their salaries; fail to enroll them for entitlement to social security and other benefits; give them positions, titles or designations that connote short-term employment.\n\nOthers are more creative: they set up \"distributors\" or \"dealers\" which are, in reality, shell or dummy companies. In this manner, the mother company avoids the employer-employee relations, and is thus shielded from liability from employee claims in case of illegal dismissal, closure, unfair labor practices and the like. In those instances, the poor employees, finding the shell or dummy company to be without assets, often end up confused and without recourse as to whom to run after. They sue the mother company which conveniently sets up the defense of absence of employer-employee relations. In San Miguel Corporation v. MAERC Integrated Services, Inc. , [20] we took note of the practice of hiring employees through labor contractors that catered exclusively to the employment needs of SMC or its divisions or other specific business interests, such that after the specific SMC business or division ceases to do business, the labor contractor likewise ceases its operations.\n\nThe contrivances may be many and the schemes ingenious and imaginative. But this Court will not hesitate to put pen to a line and defend the worker's right to be secure in his (or her) proprietary right to regular employment and his right to a secure employment, viz , one that is free from fear and doubt, that anytime he could be removed, retrenched, his contract not renewed or he might not be re-hired. The ramifications may seem trivial, but we cannot allow the ordinary Filipino worker's right to tenurial security to be put in jeopardy by recurrent but abhorrent practices that threaten the very lives of those that depend on him.\n\nConsidering, however, the supervening event that SMC's Magnolia Division has been acquired by another entity, it appears that private respondent's reinstatement is no longer feasible. Instead, he should be awarded separation pay as an alternative. [21] Likewise, owing to petitioner's bad faith, it should be held liable to pay damages for causing undue injury and inconvenience to the private respondent in its contractual hiring-firing-rehiring scheme.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED and the assailed CA decision dated September 30, 1999 is AFFIRMED , with the MODIFICATION that if the reinstatement of private respondent is no longer practicable or feasible, then petitioner SMC is ordered to pay him, in addition to the other monetary awards, separation pay for the period from October 31, 1990 when he was dismissed until he shall have been actually paid at the rate of one (1) month salary for every year of his employment, with a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) year, or the rate of separation pay awarded by petitioner to its other regular employees as provided by written agreement, policy or practice, whichever is higher or most beneficial to private respondent.\n\nIn addition, petitioner is hereby suffered to indemnify private respondent the amount of P50,000.00 as nominal damages for its bad faith in juggling the latter from one labor contractor to another and causing him unnecessary injury and inconvenience, and for denying him his proprietary right to regular employment.\n\nLet this case be REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the computation of private respondent's backwages, proportionate 13th month pay, separation pay, attorneys' fees and other monetary awards; and for immediate execution.\n\nCosts against the petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.\nCorona, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Presbitero J.

ERNESTO QUIAMCO, RESPONDENT .\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCORONA, J.:\n\nHoneste vivere, non alterum laedere et jus suum cuique tribuere . To live virtuously, not to injure others and to give everyone his due. These supreme norms of justice are the underlying principles of law and order in society. We reaffirm them in this petition for review on certiorari assailing the July 26, 2000 decision [1] and October 18, 2000 resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 47571.\n\nIn 1982, respondent Ernesto C. Quiamco was approached by Juan Davalan, [2] Josefino Gabutero and Raul Generoso to amicably settle the civil aspect of a criminal case for robbery [3] filed by Quiamco against them. They surrendered to him a red Honda XL-100 motorcycle and a photocopy of its certificate of registration. Respondent asked for the original certificate of registration but the three accused never came to see him again. Meanwhile, the motorcycle was parked in an open space inside respondent's business establishment, Avesco-AVNE Enterprises, where it was visible and accessible to the public.\n\nIt turned out that, in October 1981, the motorcycle had been sold on installment basis to Gabutero by petitioner Ramas Uypitching Sons, Inc., a family-owned corporation managed by petitioner Atty. Ernesto Ramas Uypitching. To secure its payment, the motorcycle was mortgaged to petitioner corporation. [4]\n\nWhen Gabutero could no longer pay the installments, Davalan assumed the obligation and continued the payments. In September 1982, however, Davalan stopped paying the remaining installments and told petitioner corporation's collector, Wilfredo Vera\u00f1o, that the motorcycle had allegedly been \"taken by respondent's men.\"\n\nNine years later, on January 26, 1991, petitioner Uypitching, accompanied by policemen, [5] went to Avesco-AVNE Enterprises to recover the motorcycle. The leader of the police team, P/Lt. Arturo Vendiola, talked to the clerk in charge and asked for respondent. While P/Lt. Vendiola and the clerk were talking, petitioner Uypitching paced back and forth inside the establishment uttering \"Quiamco is a thief of a motorcycle.\"\n\nOn learning that respondent was not in Avesco-AVNE Enterprises, the policemen left to look for respondent in his residence while petitioner Uypitching stayed in the establishment to take photographs of the motorcycle. Unable to find respondent, the policemen went back to Avesco-AVNE Enterprises and, on petitioner Uypitching's instruction and over the clerk's objection, took the motorcycle.\n\nOn February 18, 1991, petitioner Uypitching filed a criminal complaint for qualified theft and/or violation of the Anti-Fencing Law [6] against respondent in the Office of the City Prosecutor of Dumaguete City. [7] Respondent moved for dismissal because the complaint did not charge an offense as he had neither stolen nor bought the motorcycle. The Office of the City Prosecutor dismissed the complaint [8] and denied petitioner Uypitching's subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n\nRespondent filed an action for damages against petitioners in the RTC of Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, Branch 37. [9] He sought to hold the petitioners liable for the following: (1) unlawful taking of the motorcycle; (2) utterance of a defamatory remark (that respondent was a thief) and (3) precipitate filing of a baseless and malicious complaint. These acts humiliated and embarrassed the respondent and injured his reputation and integrity.\n\nOn July 30, 1994, the trial court rendered a decision [10] finding that petitioner Uypitching was motivated with malice and ill will when he called respondent a thief, took the motorcycle in an abusive manner and filed a baseless complaint for qualified theft and/or violation of the Anti-Fencing Law. Petitioners' acts were found to be contrary to Articles 19 [11] and 20 [12] of the Civil Code. Hence, the trial court held petitioners liable to respondent for P500,000 moral damages, P200,000 exemplary damages and P50,000 attorney's fees plus costs.\n\nPetitioners appealed the RTC decision but the CA affirmed the trial court's decision with modification, reducing the award of moral and exemplary damages to P300,000 and P100,000, respectively. [13] Petitioners sought reconsideration but it was denied. Thus, this petition.\n\nIn their petition and memorandum, petitioners submit that the sole (allegedly) issue to be resolved here is whether the filing of a complaint for qualified theft and/or violation of the Anti-Fencing Law in the Office of the City Prosecutor warranted the award of moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs in favor of respondent.\n\nPetitioners' suggestion is misleading. They were held liable for damages not only for instituting a groundless complaint against respondent but also for making a slanderous remark and for taking the motorcycle from respondent's establishment in an abusive manner.\n\nCorrectness of the Findings\nof the RTC and CA\n\nAs they never questioned the findings of the RTC and CA that malice and ill will attended not only the public imputation of a crime to respondent [14] but also the taking of the motorcycle, petitioners were deemed to have accepted the correctness of such findings. This alone was sufficient to hold petitioners liable for damages to respondent.\n\nNevertheless, to address petitioners' concern, we also find that the trial and appellate courts correctly ruled that the filing of the complaint was tainted with malice and bad faith. Petitioners themselves in fact described their action as a \"precipitate act.\" [15] Petitioners were bent on portraying respondent as a thief. In this connection, we quote with approval the following findings of the RTC, as adopted by the CA:\nx x x There was malice or ill-will [in filing the complaint before the City Prosecutor's Office] because Atty. Ernesto Ramas Uypitching knew or ought to have known as he is a lawyer, that there was no probable cause at all for filing a criminal complaint for qualified theft and fencing activity against [respondent]. Atty. Uypitching had no personal knowledge that [respondent] stole the motorcycle in question. He was merely told by his bill collector ([ i.e. ] the bill collector of Ramas Uypitching Sons, Inc.)[,] Wilfredo Vera\u00f1o[,] that Juan Dabalan will [no longer] pay the remaining installment(s) for the motorcycle because the motorcycle was taken by the men of [respondent]. It must be noted that the term used by Wilfredo Vera\u00f1o in informing Atty. Ernesto Ramas Uypitching of the refusal of Juan Dabalan to pay for the remaining installment was [']taken['], not [']unlawfully taken['] or 'stolen.' Yet, despite the double hearsay, Atty. Ernesto Ramas Uypitching not only executed the [complaint-affidavit] wherein he named [respondent] as 'the suspect' of the stolen motorcycle but also charged [respondent] of 'qualified theft and fencing activity' before the City [Prosecutor's] Office of Dumaguete. The absence of probable cause necessarily signifies the presence of malice. What is deplorable in all these is that Juan Dabalan, the owner of the motorcycle, did not accuse [respondent] or the latter's men of stealing the motorcycle[,] much less bother[ed] to file a case for qualified theft before the authorities. That Atty. Uypitching's act in charging [respondent] with qualified theft and fencing activity is tainted with malice is also shown by his answer to the question of Cupid Gonzaga [16] [during one of their conversations] - \"why should you still file a complaint\" You have already recovered the motorcycle...\"[:] \"Aron motagam ang kawatan ug motor.\" (\"To teach a lesson to the thief of motorcycle.\") [17] Moreover, the existence of malice, ill will or bad faith is a factual matter. As a rule, findings of fact of the trial court, when affirmed by the appellate court, are conclusive on this Court. We see no compelling reason to reverse the findings of the RTC and the CA.\n\nPetitioners Abused Their\nRight of Recovery as\nMortgagee(s)\n\nPetitioners claim that they should not be held liable for petitioner corporation's exercise of its right as seller-mortgagee to recover the mortgaged vehicle preliminary to the enforcement of its right to foreclose on the mortgage in case of default. They are clearly mistaken.\n\nTrue, a mortgagee may take steps to recover the mortgaged property to enable it to enforce or protect its foreclosure right thereon. There is, however, a well-defined procedure for the recovery of possession of mortgaged property: if a mortgagee is unable to obtain possession of a mortgaged property for its sale on foreclosure, he must bring a civil action either to recover such possession as a preliminary step to the sale, or to obtain judicial foreclosure. [18]\n\nPetitioner corporation failed to bring the proper civil action necessary to acquire legal possession of the motorcycle. Instead, petitioner Uypitching descended on respondent's establishment with his policemen and ordered the seizure of the motorcycle without a search warrant or court order. Worse, in the course of the illegal seizure of the motorcycle, petitioner Uypitching even mouthed a slanderous statement.\n\nNo doubt, petitioner corporation, acting through its co-petitioner Uypitching, blatantly disregarded the lawful procedure for the enforcement of its right, to the prejudice of respondent. Petitioners' acts violated the law as well as public morals, and transgressed the proper norms of human relations.\n\nThe basic principle of human relations, embodied in Article 19 of the Civil Code, provides:\nArt. 19. Every person must in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give every one his due, and observe honesty and good faith. Article 19, also known as the \"principle of abuse of right,\" prescribes that a person should not use his right unjustly or contrary to honesty and good faith, otherwise he opens himself to liability. [19] It seeks to preclude the use of, or the tendency to use, a legal right (or duty) as a means to unjust ends.\n\nThere is an abuse of right when it is exercised solely to prejudice or injure another. [20] The exercise of a right must be in accordance with the purpose for which it was established and must not be excessive or unduly harsh; there must be no intention to harm another. [21] Otherwise, liability for damages to the injured party will attach.\n\nIn this case, the manner by which the motorcycle was taken at petitioners' instance was not only attended by bad faith but also contrary to the procedure laid down by law. Considered in conjunction with the defamatory statement, petitioners' exercise of the right to recover the mortgaged vehicle was utterly prejudicial and injurious to respondent. On the other hand, the precipitate act of filing an unfounded complaint could not in any way be considered to be in accordance with the purpose for which the right to prosecute a crime was established. Thus, the totality of petitioners' actions showed a calculated design to embarrass, humiliate and publicly ridicule respondent. Petitioners acted in an excessively harsh fashion to the prejudice of respondent. Contrary to law, petitioners willfully caused damage to respondent. Hence, they should indemnify him.

CAPITOL MEDICAL CENTER, DR. OSCAR ESTRADA,DR. ELY VILLAFLOR,DR. ROSA UY,DR. JOEL ENRIQUEZ,DR. PERPETUA LACSON, DR. NOE ESPINOLA, AND NURSE J. DUMLAO, RESPONDENTSD E C I S I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseThis petition for review[1] assails the 6 February 1998 Decision[2] and 21 March 2000 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 45641. The Court of Appeals affirmed in toto the 22 November 1993 Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 33, finding Dr. Oscar Estrada solely liable for damages for the death of his patient, Corazon Nogales, while absolving the remaining respondents of any liability. The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.The FactsPregnant with her fourth child, Corazon Nogales (\"Corazon\"), who was then 37 years old, was under the exclusive prenatal care of Dr. Oscar Estrada (\"Dr. Estrada\") beginning on her fourth month of pregnancy or as early as December 1975. While Corazon was on her last trimester of pregnancy, Dr. Estrada noted an increase in her blood pressure and development of leg edema[5] indicating preeclampsia,[6] which is a dangerous complication of pregnancy.[7]Around midnight of 25 May 1976, Corazon started to experience mild labor pains prompting Corazon and Rogelio Nogales (\"Spouses Nogales\") to see Dr. Estrada at his home. After examining Corazon, Dr. Estrada advised her immediate admission to the Capitol Medical Center (\"CMC\"). On 26 May 1976, Corazon was admitted at 2:30 a.m. at the CMC after the staff nurse noted the written admission request[8] of Dr. Estrada. Upon Corazon's admission at the CMC, Rogelio Nogales (\"Rogelio\") executed and signed the \"Consent on Admission and Agreement\"[9] and \"Admission Agreement.\"[10] Corazon was then brought to the labor room of the CMC.Dr. Rosa Uy (\"Dr. Uy\"), who was then a resident physician of CMC, conducted an internal examination of Corazon. Dr. Uy then called up Dr. Estrada to notify him of her findings. Based on the Doctor's Order Sheet,[11] around 3:00 a.m., Dr. Estrada ordered for 10 mg. of valium to be administered immediately by intramuscular injection. Dr. Estrada later ordered the start of intravenous administration of syntocinon admixed with dextrose, 5%, in lactated Ringers' solution, at the rate of eight to ten micro-drops per minute.According to the Nurse's Observation Notes,[12] Dr. Joel Enriquez (\"Dr. Enriquez\"), an anesthesiologist at CMC, was notified at 4:15 a.m. of Corazon's admission. Subsequently, when asked if he needed the services of an anesthesiologist, Dr. Estrada refused. Despite Dr. Estrada's refusal, Dr. Enriquez stayed to observe Corazon's condition.At 6:00 a.m., Corazon was transferred to Delivery Room No. 1 of the CMC. At 6:10 a.m., Corazon's bag of water ruptured spontaneously. At 6:12 a.m., Corazon's cervix was fully dilated. At 6:13 a.m., Corazon started to experience convulsions. At 6:15 a.m., Dr. Estrada ordered the injection of ten grams of magnesium sulfate. However, Dr. Ely Villaflor (\"Dr. Villaflor\"), who was assisting Dr. Estrada, administered only 2.5 grams of magnesium sulfate.At 6:22 a.m., Dr. Estrada, assisted by Dr. Villaflor, applied low forceps to extract Corazon's baby. In the process, a 1.0 x 2.5 cm. piece of cervical tissue was allegedly torn. The baby came out in an apnic, cyanotic, weak and injured condition. Consequently, the baby had to be intubated and resuscitated by Dr. Enriquez and Dr. Payumo.At 6:27 a.m., Corazon began to manifest moderate vaginal bleeding which rapidly became profuse. Corazon's blood pressure dropped from 130/80 to 60/40 within five minutes. There was continuous profuse vaginal bleeding. The assisting nurse administered hemacel through a gauge 19 needle as a side drip to the ongoing intravenous injection of dextrose.At 7:45 a.m., Dr. Estrada ordered blood typing and cross matching with bottled blood. It took approximately 30 minutes for the CMC laboratory, headed by Dr. Perpetua Lacson (\"Dr. Lacson\"), to comply with Dr. Estrada's order and deliver the blood.At 8:00 a.m., Dr. Noe Espinola (\"Dr. Espinola\"), head of the Obstetrics-Gynecology Department of the CMC, was apprised of Corazon's condition by telephone. Upon being informed that Corazon was bleeding profusely, Dr. Espinola ordered immediate hysterectomy. Rogelio was made to sign a \"Consent to Operation.\"[13] Due to the inclement weather then, Dr. Espinola, who was fetched from his residence by an ambulance, arrived at the CMC about an hour later or at 9:00 a.m. He examined the patient and ordered some resuscitative measures to be administered. Despite Dr. Espinola's efforts, Corazon died at 9:15 a.m. The cause of death was \"hemorrhage, post partum.\"[14]On 14 May 1980, petitioners filed a complaint for damages[15] with the Regional Trial Court[16] of Manila against CMC, Dr. Estrada, Dr. Villaflor, Dr. Uy, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Lacson, Dr. Espinola, and a certain Nurse J. Dumlao for the death of Corazon. Petitioners mainly contended that defendant physicians and CMC personnel were negligent in the treatment and management of Corazon's condition. Petitioners charged CMC with negligence in the selection and supervision of defendant physicians and hospital staff.For failing to file their answer to the complaint despite service of summons, the trial court declared Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, and Nurse Dumlao in default.[17] CMC, Dr. Villaflor, Dr. Uy, Dr. Espinola, and Dr. Lacson filed their respective answers denying and opposing the allegations in the complaint. Subsequently, trial ensued.After more than 11 years of trial, the trial court rendered judgment on 22 November 1993 finding Dr. Estrada solely liable for damages. The trial court ruled as follows:The victim was under his pre-natal care, apparently, his fault began from his incorrect and inadequate management and lack of treatment of the pre-eclamptic condition of his patient. It is not disputed that he misapplied the forceps in causing the delivery because it resulted in a large cervical tear which had caused the profuse bleeding which he also failed to control with the application of inadequate injection of magnesium sulfate by his assistant Dra. Ely Villaflor. Dr. Estrada even failed to notice the erroneous administration by nurse Dumlao of hemacel by way of side drip, instead of direct intravenous injection, and his failure to consult a senior obstetrician at an early stage of the problem. On the part however of Dra. Ely Villaflor, Dra. Rosa Uy, Dr. Joel Enriquez, Dr. Lacson, Dr. Espinola, nurse J. Dumlao and CMC, the Court finds no legal justification to find them civilly liable.On the part of Dra. Ely Villaflor, she was only taking orders from Dr. Estrada, the principal physician of Corazon Nogales. She can only make suggestions in the manner the patient maybe treated but she cannot impose her will as to do so would be to substitute her good judgment to that of Dr. Estrada. If she failed to correctly diagnose the true cause of the bleeding which in this case appears to be a cervical laceration, it cannot be safely concluded by the Court that Dra. Villaflor had the correct diagnosis and she failed to inform Dr. Estrada. No evidence was introduced to show that indeed Dra. Villaflor had discovered that there was laceration at the cervical area of the patient's internal organ.On the part of nurse Dumlao, there is no showing that when she administered the hemacel as a side drip, she did it on her own. If the correct procedure was directly thru the veins, it could only be because this was what was probably the orders of Dr. Estrada.While the evidence of the plaintiffs shows that Dr. Noe Espinola, who was the Chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology who attended to the patient Mrs. Nogales, it was only at 9:00 a.m. That he was able to reach the hospital because of typhoon Didang (Exhibit 2). While he was able to give prescription in the manner Corazon Nogales may be treated, the prescription was based on the information given to him by phone and he acted on the basis of facts as presented to him, believing in good faith that such is the correct remedy. He was not with Dr. Estrada when the patient was brought to the hospital at 2:30 o'clock a.m. So, whatever errors that Dr. Estrada committed on the patient before 9:00 o'clock a.m. are certainly the errors of Dr. Estrada and cannot be the mistake of Dr. Noe Espinola. His failure to come to the hospital on time was due to fortuitous event.On the part of Dr. Joel Enriquez, while he was present in the delivery room, it is not incumbent upon him to call the attention of Dr. Estrada, Dra. Villaflor and also of Nurse Dumlao on the alleged errors committed by them. Besides, as anesthesiologist, he has no authority to control the actuations of Dr. Estrada and Dra. Villaflor. For the Court to assume that there were errors being committed in the presence of Dr. Enriquez would be to dwell on conjectures and speculations.On the civil liability of Dr. Perpetua Lacson, [s]he is a hematologist and in-charge of the blood bank of the CMC. The Court cannot accept the theory of the plaintiffs that there was delay in delivering the blood needed by the patient. It was testified, that in order that this blood will be made available, a laboratory test has to be conducted to determine the type of blood, cross matching and other matters consistent with medical science so, the lapse of 30 minutes maybe considered a reasonable time to do all of these things, and not a delay as the plaintiffs would want the Court to believe.Admittedly, Dra. Rosa Uy is a resident physician of the Capitol Medical Center. She was sued because of her alleged failure to notice the incompetence and negligence of Dr. Estrada. However, there is no evidence to support such theory. No evidence was adduced to show that Dra. Rosa Uy as a resident physician of Capitol Medical Center, had knowledge of the mismanagement of the patient Corazon Nogales, and that notwithstanding such knowledge, she tolerated the same to happen.In the pre-trial order, plaintiffs and CMC agreed that defendant CMC did not have any hand or participation in the selection or hiring of Dr. Estrada or his assistant Dra. Ely Villaflor as attending physician[s] of the deceased. In other words, the two (2) doctors were not employees of the hospital and therefore the hospital did not have control over their professional conduct. When Mrs. Nogales was brought to the hospital, it was an emergency case and defendant CMC had no choice but to admit her. Such being the case, there is therefore no legal ground to apply the provisions of Article 2176 and 2180 of the New Civil Code referring to the vicarious liability of an employer for the negligence of its employees. If ever in this case there is fault or negligence in the treatment of the deceased on the part of the attending physicians who were employed by the family of the deceased, such civil liability should be borne by the attending physicians under the principle of \"respondeat superior\".WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding defendant Dr. Estrada of Number 13 Pitimini St. San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City civilly liable to pay plaintiffs: 1) By way of actual damages in the amount of P105,000.00; 2) By way of moral damages in the amount of P700,000.00; 3) Attorney's fees in the amount of P100,000.00 and to pay the costs of suit.For failure of the plaintiffs to adduce evidence to support its [sic] allegations against the other defendants, the complaint is hereby ordered dismissed. While the Court looks with disfavor the filing of the present complaint against the other defendants by the herein plaintiffs, as in a way it has caused them personal inconvenience and slight damage on their name and reputation, the Court cannot accepts [sic] however, the theory of the remaining defendants that plaintiffs were motivated in bad faith in the filing of this complaint. For this reason defendants' counterclaims are hereby ordered dismissed.SO ORDERED.[18]Petitioners appealed the trial court's decision. Petitioners claimed that aside from Dr. Estrada, the remaining respondents should be held equally liable for negligence. Petitioners pointed out the extent of each respondent's alleged liability. On 6 February 1998, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.[19] Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration which the Court of Appeals denied in its Resolution of 21 March 2000.[20]Hence, this petition.Meanwhile, petitioners filed a Manifestation dated 12 April 2002[21] stating that respondents Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao \"need no longer be notified of the petition because they are absolutely not involved in the issue raised before the [Court], regarding the liability of [CMC].\"[22] Petitioners stressed that the subject matter of this petition is the liability of CMC for the negligence of Dr. Estrada.[23]The Court issued a Resolution dated 9 September 2002[24] dispensing with the requirement to submit the correct and present addresses of respondents Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao. The Court stated that with the filing of petitioners' Manifestation, it should be understood that they are claiming only against respondents CMC, Dr. Espinola, Dr. Lacson, and Dr. Uy who have filed their respective comments. Petitioners are foregoing further claims against respondents Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao.The Court noted that Dr. Estrada did not appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals, affirming the trial court's judgment, is already final as against Dr. Oscar Estrada. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration[25] of the Court's 9 September 2002 Resolution claiming that Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor and Nurse Dumlao were notified of the petition at their counsels' last known addresses. Petitioners reiterated their imputation of negligence on these respondents. The Court denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration in its 18 February 2004 Resolution.[26]The Court of Appeals' RulingIn its Decision of 6 February 1998, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's ruling. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' view that the doctrine in Darling v. Charleston Community Memorial Hospital[27] applies to this case. According to the Court of Appeals, the present case differs from the Darling case since Dr. Estrada is an independent contractor-physician whereas the Darling case involved a physician and a nurse who were employees of the hospital.Citing other American cases, the Court of Appeals further held that the mere fact that a hospital permitted a physician to practice medicine and use its facilities is not sufficient to render the hospital liable for the physician's negligence.[28] A hospital is not responsible for the negligence of a physician who is an independent contractor.[29]The Court of Appeals found the cases of Davidson v. Conole[30] and Campbell v. Emma Laing Stevens Hospital[31] applicable to this case. Quoting Campbell, the Court of Appeals stated that where there is no proof that defendant physician was an employee of defendant hospital or that defendant hospital had reason to know that any acts of malpractice would take place, defendant hospital could not be held liable for its failure to intervene in the relationship of physician-patient between defendant physician and plaintiff.On the liability of the other respondents, the Court of Appeals applied the \"borrowed servant\" doctrine considering that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor who was merely exercising hospital privileges. This doctrine provides that once the surgeon enters the operating room and takes charge of the proceedings, the acts or omissions of operating room personnel, and any negligence associated with such acts or omissions, are imputable to the surgeon.[32] While the assisting physicians and nurses may be employed by the hospital, or engaged by the patient, they normally become the temporary servants or agents of the surgeon in charge while the operation is in progress, and liability may be imposed upon the surgeon for their negligent acts under the doctrine of respondeat superior.[33]The Court of Appeals concluded that since Rogelio engaged Dr. Estrada as the attending physician of his wife, any liability for malpractice must be Dr. Estrada's sole responsibility.While it found the amount of damages fair and reasonable, the Court of Appeals held that no interest could be imposed on unliquidated claims or damages.The IssueBasically, the issue in this case is whether CMC is vicariously liable for the negligence of Dr. Estrada. The resolution of this issue rests, on the other hand, on the ascertainment of the relationship between Dr. Estrada and CMC. The Court also believes that a determination of the extent of liability of the other respondents is inevitable to finally and completely dispose of the present controversy. The Ruling of the CourtThe petition is partly meritorious.On the Liability of CMCDr. Estrada's negligence in handling the treatment and management of Corazon's condition which ultimately resulted in Corazon's death is no longer in issue. Dr. Estrada did not appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the ruling of the trial court finding Dr. Estrada solely liable for damages. Accordingly, the finding of the trial court on Dr. Estrada's negligence is already final.Petitioners maintain that CMC is vicariously liable for Dr. Estrada's negligence based on Article 2180 in relation to Article 2176 of the Civil Code. These provisions pertinently state:Art. 2180. The obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.x x x xEmployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.x x x xThe responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage.Art. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.Similarly, in the United States, a hospital which is the employer, master, or principal of a physician employee, servant, or agent, may be held liable for the physician's negligence under the doctrine of respondeat superior.[34] In the present case, petitioners maintain that CMC, in allowing Dr. Estrada to practice and admit patients at CMC, should be liable for Dr. Estrada's malpractice. Rogelio claims that he knew Dr. Estrada as an accredited physician of CMC, though he discovered later that Dr. Estrada was not a salaried employee of the CMC.[35] Rogelio further claims that he was dealing with CMC, whose primary concern was the treatment and management of his wife's condition. Dr. Estrada just happened to be the specific person he talked to representing CMC.[36] Moreover, the fact that CMC made Rogelio sign a Consent on Admission and Admission Agreement[37] and a Consent to Operation printed on the letterhead of CMC indicates that CMC considered Dr. Estrada as a member of its medical staff.On the other hand, CMC disclaims liability by asserting that Dr. Estrada was a mere visiting physician and that it admitted Corazon because her physical condition then was classified an emergency obstetrics case.[38]CMC alleges that Dr. Estrada is an independent contractor \"for whose actuations CMC would be a total stranger.\" CMC maintains that it had no control or supervision over Dr. Estrada in the exercise of his medical profession.The Court had the occasion to determine the relationship between a hospital and a consultant or visiting physician and the liability of such hospital for that physician's negligence in Ramos v. Court of Appeals,[39] to wit:In the first place, hospitals exercise significant control in the hiring and firing of consultants and in the conduct of their work within the hospital premises. Doctors who apply for \"consultant\" slots, visiting or attending, are required to submit proof of completion of residency, their educational qualifications; generally, evidence of accreditation by the appropriate board (diplomate), evidence of fellowship in most cases, and references. These requirements are carefully scrutinized by members of the hospital administration or by a review committee set up by the hospital who either accept or reject the application. This is particularly true with respondent hospital.After a physician is accepted, either as a visiting or attending consultant, he is normally required to attend clinico-pathological conferences, conduct bedside rounds for clerks, interns and residents, moderate grand rounds and patient audits and perform other tasks and responsibilities, for the privilege of being able to maintain a clinic in the hospital, and/or for the privilege of admitting patients into the hospital. In addition to these, the physician's performance as a specialist is generally evaluated by a peer review committee on the basis of mortality and morbidity statistics, and feedback from patients, nurses, interns and residents. A consultant remiss in his duties, or a consultant who regularly falls short of the minimum standards acceptable to the hospital or its peer review committee, is normally politely terminated.In other words, private hospitals, hire, fire and exercise real control over their attending and visiting \"consultant\" staff. While \"consultants\" are not, technically employees, a point which respondent hospital asserts in denying all responsibility for the patient's condition, the control exercised, the hiring, and the right to terminate consultants all fulfill the important hallmarks of an employer-employee relationship, with the exception of the payment of wages. In assessing whether such a relationship in fact exists, the control test is determining. Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, we rule that for the purpose of allocating responsibility in medical negligence cases, an employer-employee relationship in effect exists between hospitals and their attending and visiting physicians. This being the case, the question now arises as to whether or not respondent hospital is solidarily liable with respondent doctors for petitioner's condition.The basis for holding an employer solidarily responsible for the negligence of its employee is found in Article 2180 of the Civil Code which considers a person accountable not only for his own acts but also for those of others based on the former's responsibility under a relationship of patria potestas. x x x[40] (Emphasis supplied)While the Court in Ramos did not expound on the control test, such test essentially determines whether an employment relationship exists between a physician and a hospital based on the exercise of control over the physician as to details. Specifically, the employer (or the hospital) must have the right to control both the means and the details of the process by which the employee (or the physician) is to accomplish his task.[41]After a thorough examination of the voluminous records of this case, the Court finds no single evidence pointing to CMC's exercise of control over Dr. Estrada's treatment and management of Corazon's condition. It is undisputed that throughout Corazon's pregnancy, she was under the exclusive prenatal care of Dr. Estrada. At the time of Corazon's admission at CMC and during her delivery, it was Dr. Estrada, assisted by Dr. Villaflor, who attended to Corazon. There was no showing that CMC had a part in diagnosing Corazon's condition. While Dr. Estrada enjoyed staff privileges at CMC, such fact alone did not make him an employee of CMC.[42] CMC merely allowed Dr. Estrada to use its facilities[43] when Corazon was about to give birth, which CMC considered an emergency. Considering these circumstances, Dr. Estrada is not an employee of CMC, but an independent contractor.The question now is whether CMC is automatically exempt from liability considering that Dr. Estrada is an independent contractor-physician.In general, a hospital is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor-physician. There is, however, an exception to this principle. The hospital may be liable if the physician is the \"ostensible\" agent of the hospital.[44] This exception is also known as the \"doctrine of apparent authority.\"[45] In Gilbert v. Sycamore Municipal Hospital,[46] the Illinois Supreme Court explained the doctrine of apparent authority in this wise:[U]nder the doctrine of apparent authority a hospital can be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of a physician providing care at the hospital, regardless of whether the physician is an independent contractor, unless the patient knows, or should have known, that the physician is an independent contractor. The elements of the action have been set out as follows:\"For a hospital to be liable under the doctrine of apparent authority, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the hospital, or its agent, acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual who was alleged to be negligent was an employee or agent of the hospital; (2) where the acts of the agent create the appearance of authority, the plaintiff must also prove that the hospital had knowledge of and acquiesced in them; and (3) the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the conduct of the hospital or its agent, consistent with ordinary care and prudence.\"The element of \"holding out\" on the part of the hospital does not require an express representation by the hospital that the person alleged to be negligent is an employee. Rather, the element is satisfied if the hospital holds itself out as a provider of emergency room care without informing the patient that the care is provided by independent contractors.The element of justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff is satisfied if the plaintiff relies upon the hospital to provide complete emergency room care, rather than upon a specific physician.The doctrine of apparent authority essentially involves two factors to determine the liability of an independent-contractor physician. The first factor focuses on the hospital's manifestations and is sometimes described as an inquiry whether the hospital acted in a manner which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual who was alleged to be negligent was an employee or agent of the hospital.[47] In this regard, the hospital need not make express representations to the patient that the treating physician is an employee of the hospital; rather a representation may be general and implied.[48]The doctrine of apparent authority is a species of the doctrine of estoppel. Article 1431 of the Civil Code provides that \"[t]hrough estoppel, an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon.\" Estoppel rests on this rule: \"Whenever a party has, by his own declaration, act, or omission, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true, and to act upon such belief, he cannot, in any litigation arising out of such declaration, act or omission, be permitted to falsify it.\"[49]In the instant case, CMC impliedly held out Dr. Estrada as a member of its medical staff. Through CMC's acts, CMC clothed Dr. Estrada with apparent authority thereby leading the Spouses Nogales to believe that Dr. Estrada was an employee or agent of CMC. CMC cannot now repudiate such authority. First, CMC granted staff privileges to Dr. Estrada. CMC extended its medical staff and facilities to Dr. Estrada. Upon Dr. Estrada's request for Corazon's admission, CMC, through its personnel, readily accommodated Corazon and updated Dr. Estrada of her condition. Second, CMC made Rogelio sign consent forms printed on CMC letterhead. Prior to Corazon's admission and supposed hysterectomy, CMC asked Rogelio to sign release forms, the contents of which reinforced Rogelio's belief that Dr. Estrada was a member of CMC's medical staff.[50] The Consent on Admission and Agreement explicitly provides:KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:I, Rogelio Nogales, of legal age, a resident of 1974 M. H. Del Pilar St., Malate Mla., being the father/mother/brother/sister/spouse/relative/ guardian/or person in custody of Ma. Corazon, and representing his/her family, of my own volition and free will, do consent and submit said Ma. Corazon to Dr. Oscar Estrada (hereinafter referred to as Physician) for cure, treatment, retreatment, or emergency measures, that the Physician, personally or by and through the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff, may use, adapt, or employ such means, forms or methods of cure, treatment, retreatment, or emergency measures as he may see best and most expedient; that Ma. Corazon and I will comply with any and all rules, regulations, directions, and instructions of the Physician, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff; and, that I will not hold liable or responsible and hereby waive and forever discharge and hold free the Physician, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff, from any and all claims of whatever kind of nature, arising from directly or indirectly, or by reason of said cure, treatment, or retreatment, or emergency measures or intervention of said physician, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff.x x x x[51] (Emphasis supplied)While the Consent to Operation pertinently reads, thus:I, ROGELIO NOGALES, x x x, of my own volition and free will, do consent and submit said CORAZON NOGALES to Hysterectomy, by the Surgical Staff and Anesthesiologists of Capitol Medical Center and/or whatever succeeding operations, treatment, or emergency measures as may be necessary and most expedient; and, that I will not hold liable or responsible and hereby waive and forever discharge and hold free the Surgeon, his assistants, anesthesiologists, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff, from any and all claims of whatever kind of nature, arising from directly or indirectly, or by reason of said operation or operations, treatment, or emergency measures, or intervention of the Surgeon, his assistants, anesthesiologists, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff.[52] (Emphasis supplied)Without any indication in these consent forms that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor-physician, the Spouses Nogales could not have known that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor. Significantly, no one from CMC informed the Spouses Nogales that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor. On the contrary, Dr. Atencio, who was then a member of CMC Board of Directors, testified that Dr. Estrada was part of CMC's surgical staff.[53]Third, Dr. Estrada's referral of Corazon's profuse vaginal bleeding to Dr. Espinola, who was then the Head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of CMC, gave the impression that Dr. Estrada as a member of CMC's medical staff was collaborating with other CMC-employed specialists in treating Corazon. The second factor focuses on the patient's reliance. It is sometimes characterized as an inquiry on whether the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the conduct of the hospital or its agent, consistent with ordinary care and prudence.[54] The records show that the Spouses Nogales relied upon a perceived employment relationship with CMC in accepting Dr. Estrada's services. Rogelio testified that he and his wife specifically chose Dr. Estrada to handle Corazon's delivery not only because of their friend's recommendation, but more importantly because of Dr. Estrada's \"connection with a reputable hospital, the [CMC].\"[55] In other words, Dr. Estrada's relationship with CMC played a significant role in the Spouses Nogales' decision in accepting Dr. Estrada's services as the obstetrician-gynecologist for Corazon's delivery. Moreover, as earlier stated, there is no showing that before and during Corazon's confinement at CMC, the Spouses Nogales knew or should have known that Dr. Estrada was not an employee of CMC. Further, the Spouses Nogales looked to CMC to provide the best medical care and support services for Corazon's delivery. The Court notes that prior to Corazon's fourth pregnancy, she used to give birth inside a clinic. Considering Corazon's age then, the Spouses Nogales decided to have their fourth child delivered at CMC, which Rogelio regarded one of the best hospitals at the time.[56] This is precisely because the Spouses Nogales feared that Corazon might experience complications during her delivery which would be better addressed and treated in a modern and big hospital such as CMC. Moreover, Rogelio's consent in Corazon's hysterectomy to be performed by a different physician, namely Dr. Espinola, is a clear indication of Rogelio's confidence in CMC's surgical staff.CMC's defense that all it did was \"to extend to [Corazon] its facilities\" is untenable. The Court cannot close its eyes to the reality that hospitals, such as CMC, are in the business of treatment. In this regard, the Court agrees with the observation made by the Court of Appeals of North Carolina in Diggs v. Novant Health, Inc.,[57] to wit:\"The conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat the patient, does not undertake to act through its doctors and nurses, but undertakes instead simply to procure them to act upon their own responsibility, no longer reflects the fact. Present day hospitals, as their manner of operation plainly demonstrates, do far more than furnish facilities for treatment. They regularly employ on a salary basis a large staff of physicians, nurses and internes [sic], as well as administrative and manual workers, and they charge patients for medical care and treatment, collecting for such services, if necessary, by legal action. Certainly, the person who avails himself of 'hospital facilities' expects that the hospital will attempt to cure him, not that its nurses or other employees will act on their own responsibility.\" x x x (Emphasis supplied)Likewise unconvincing is CMC's argument that petitioners are estopped from claiming damages based on the Consent on Admission and Consent to Operation. Both release forms consist of two parts. The first part gave CMC permission to administer to Corazon any form of recognized medical treatment which the CMC medical staff deemed advisable. The second part of the documents, which may properly be described as the releasing part, releases CMC and its employees \"from any and all claims\" arising from or by reason of the treatment and operation. The documents do not expressly release CMC from liability for injury to Corazon due to negligence during her treatment or operation. Neither do the consent forms expressly exempt CMC from liability for Corazon's death due to negligence during such treatment or operation. Such release forms, being in the nature of contracts of adhesion, are construed strictly against hospitals. Besides, a blanket release in favor of hospitals \"from any and all claims,\" which includes claims due to bad faith or gross negligence, would be contrary to public policy and thus void. Even simple negligence is not subject to blanket release in favor of establishments like hospitals but may only mitigate liability depending on the circumstances.[58] When a person needing urgent medical attention rushes to a hospital, he cannot bargain on equal footing with the hospital on the terms of admission and operation. Such a person is literally at the mercy of the hospital. There can be no clearer example of a contract of adhesion than one arising from such a dire situation. Thus, the release forms of CMC cannot relieve CMC from liability for the negligent medical treatment of Corazon. On the Liability of the Other RespondentsDespite this Court's pronouncement in its 9 September 2002[59] Resolution that the filing of petitioners' Manifestation confined petitioners' claim only against CMC, Dr. Espinola, Dr. Lacson, and Dr. Uy, who have filed their comments, the Court deems it proper to resolve the individual liability of the remaining respondents to put an end finally to this more than two-decade old controversy.a) Dr. Ely VillaflorPetitioners blame Dr. Ely Villaflor for failing to diagnose the cause of Corazon's bleeding and to suggest the correct remedy to Dr. Estrada.[60] Petitioners assert that it was Dr. Villaflor's duty to correct the error of Nurse Dumlao in the administration of hemacel.The Court is not persuaded. Dr. Villaflor admitted administering a lower dosage of magnesium sulfate. However, this was after informing Dr. Estrada that Corazon was no longer in convulsion and that her blood pressure went down to a dangerous level.[61] At that moment, Dr. Estrada instructed Dr. Villaflor to reduce the dosage of magnesium sulfate from 10 to 2.5 grams. Since petitioners did not dispute Dr. Villaflor's allegation, Dr. Villaflor's defense remains uncontroverted. Dr. Villaflor's act of administering a lower dosage of magnesium sulfate was not out of her own volition or was in contravention of Dr. Estrada's order. b) Dr. Rosa UyDr. Rosa Uy's alleged negligence consisted of her failure (1) to call the attention of Dr. Estrada on the incorrect dosage of magnesium sulfate administered by Dr. Villaflor; (2) to take corrective measures; and (3) to correct Nurse Dumlao's wrong method of hemacel administration. The Court believes Dr. Uy's claim that as a second year resident physician then at CMC, she was merely authorized to take the clinical history and physical examination of Corazon.[62] However, that routine internal examination did not ipso facto make Dr. Uy liable for the errors committed by Dr. Estrada. Further, petitioners' imputation of negligence rests on their baseless assumption that Dr. Uy was present at the delivery room. Nothing shows that Dr. Uy participated in delivering Corazon's baby. Further, it is unexpected from Dr. Uy, a mere resident physician at that time, to call the attention of a more experienced specialist, if ever she was present at the delivery room. c) Dr. Joel EnriquezPetitioners fault Dr. Joel Enriquez also for not calling the attention of Dr. Estrada, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao about their errors.[63] Petitioners insist that Dr. Enriquez should have taken, or at least suggested, corrective measures to rectify such errors. The Court is not convinced. Dr. Enriquez is an anesthesiologist whose field of expertise is definitely not obstetrics and gynecology. As such, Dr. Enriquez was not expected to correct Dr. Estrada's errors. Besides, there was no evidence of Dr. Enriquez's knowledge of any error committed by Dr. Estrada and his failure to act upon such observation. d) Dr. Perpetua LacsonPetitioners fault Dr. Perpetua Lacson for her purported delay in the delivery of blood Corazon needed.[64] Petitioners claim that Dr. Lacson was remiss in her duty of supervising the blood bank staff.As found by the trial court, there was no unreasonable delay in the delivery of blood from the time of the request until the transfusion to Corazon. Dr. Lacson competently explained the procedure before blood could be given to the patient.[65] Taking into account the bleeding time, clotting time and cross-matching, Dr. Lacson stated that it would take approximately 45-60 minutes before blood could be ready for transfusion.[66] Further, no evidence exists that Dr. Lacson neglected her duties as head of the blood bank. e) Dr. Noe EspinolaPetitioners argue that Dr. Espinola should not have ordered immediate hysterectomy without determining the underlying cause of Corazon's bleeding. Dr. Espinola should have first considered the possibility of cervical injury, and advised a thorough examination of the cervix, instead of believing outright Dr. Estrada's diagnosis that the cause of bleeding was uterine atony. Dr. Espinola's order to do hysterectomy which was based on the information he received by phone is not negligence. The Court agrees with the trial court's observation that Dr. Espinola, upon hearing such information about Corazon's condition, believed in good faith that hysterectomy was the correct remedy. At any rate, the hysterectomy did not push through because upon Dr. Espinola's arrival, it was already too late. At the time, Corazon was practically dead.f) Nurse J. DumlaoIn Moore v. Guthrie Hospital Inc.,[67] the US Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, held that to recover, a patient complaining of injuries allegedly resulting when the nurse negligently injected medicine to him intravenously instead of intramuscularly had to show that (1) an intravenous injection constituted a lack of reasonable and ordinary care; (2) the nurse injected medicine intravenously; and (3) such injection was the proximate cause of his injury.In the present case, there is no evidence of Nurse Dumlao's alleged failure to follow Dr. Estrada's specific instructions. Even assuming Nurse Dumlao defied Dr. Estrada's order, there is no showing that side-drip administration of hemacel proximately caused Corazon's death. No evidence linking Corazon's death and the alleged wrongful hemacel administration was introduced. Therefore, there is no basis to hold Nurse Dumlao liable for negligence.On the Award of Interest on DamagesThe award of interest on damages is proper and allowed under Article 2211 of the Civil Code, which states that in crimes and quasi-delicts, interest as a part of the damages may, in a proper case, be adjudicated in the discretion of the court.[68]WHEREFORE, the Court PARTLY GRANTS the petition. The Court finds respondent Capitol Medical Center vicariously liable for the negligence of Dr. Oscar Estrada. The amounts of P105,000 as actual damages and P700,000 as moral damages should each earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum computed from the date of the judgment of the trial court. The Court affirms the rest of the Decision dated 6 February 1998 and Resolution dated 21 March 2000 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 45641.

DUMLAO, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nThis petition for review [1] assails the 6 February 1998 Decision [2] and 21 March 2000 Resolution [3] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 45641. The Court of Appeals affirmed in toto the 22 November 1993 Decision [4] of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 33, finding Dr. Oscar Estrada solely liable for damages for the death of his patient, Corazon Nogales, while absolving the remaining respondents of any liability. The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe Facts\n\nPregnant with her fourth child, Corazon Nogales (\"Corazon\"), who was then 37 years old, was under the exclusive prenatal care of Dr. Oscar Estrada (\"Dr. Estrada\") beginning on her fourth month of pregnancy or as early as December 1975. While Corazon was on her last trimester of pregnancy, Dr. Estrada noted an increase in her blood pressure and development of leg edema [5] indicating preeclampsia, [6] which is a dangerous complication of pregnancy. [7]\n\nAround midnight of 25 May 1976, Corazon started to experience mild labor pains prompting Corazon and Rogelio Nogales (\"Spouses Nogales\") to see Dr. Estrada at his home. After examining Corazon, Dr. Estrada advised her immediate admission to the Capitol Medical Center (\"CMC\").\n\nOn 26 May 1976, Corazon was admitted at 2:30 a.m. at the CMC after the staff nurse noted the written admission request [8] of Dr. Estrada. Upon Corazon's admission at the CMC, Rogelio Nogales (\"Rogelio\") executed and signed the \"Consent on Admission and Agreement\" [9] and \"Admission Agreement.\" [10] Corazon was then brought to the labor room of the CMC.\n\nDr. Rosa Uy (\"Dr. Uy\"), who was then a resident physician of CMC, conducted an internal examination of Corazon. Dr. Uy then called up Dr. Estrada to notify him of her findings.\n\nBased on the Doctor's Order Sheet, [11] around 3:00 a.m., Dr. Estrada ordered for 10 mg. of valium to be administered immediately by intramuscular injection. Dr. Estrada later ordered the start of intravenous administration of syntocinon admixed with dextrose, 5%, in lactated Ringers' solution, at the rate of eight to ten micro-drops per minute.\n\nAccording to the Nurse's Observation Notes, [12] Dr. Joel Enriquez (\"Dr. Enriquez\"), an anesthesiologist at CMC, was notified at 4:15 a.m. of Corazon's admission. Subsequently, when asked if he needed the services of an anesthesiologist, Dr. Estrada refused. Despite Dr. Estrada's refusal, Dr. Enriquez stayed to observe Corazon's condition.\n\nAt 6:00 a.m., Corazon was transferred to Delivery Room No. 1 of the CMC. At 6:10 a.m., Corazon's bag of water ruptured spontaneously. At 6:12 a.m., Corazon's cervix was fully dilated. At 6:13 a.m., Corazon started to experience convulsions.\n\nAt 6:15 a.m., Dr. Estrada ordered the injection of ten grams of magnesium sulfate. However, Dr. Ely Villaflor (\"Dr. Villaflor\"), who was assisting Dr. Estrada, administered only 2.5 grams of magnesium sulfate.\n\nAt 6:22 a.m., Dr. Estrada, assisted by Dr. Villaflor, applied low forceps to extract Corazon's baby. In the process, a 1.0 x 2.5 cm. piece of cervical tissue was allegedly torn. The baby came out in an apnic, cyanotic, weak and injured condition. Consequently, the baby had to be intubated and resuscitated by Dr. Enriquez and Dr. Payumo.\n\nAt 6:27 a.m., Corazon began to manifest moderate vaginal bleeding which rapidly became profuse. Corazon's blood pressure dropped from 130/80 to 60/40 within five minutes. There was continuous profuse vaginal bleeding. The assisting nurse administered hemacel through a gauge 19 needle as a side drip to the ongoing intravenous injection of dextrose.\n\nAt 7:45 a.m., Dr. Estrada ordered blood typing and cross matching with bottled blood. It took approximately 30 minutes for the CMC laboratory, headed by Dr. Perpetua Lacson (\"Dr. Lacson\"), to comply with Dr. Estrada's order and deliver the blood.\n\nAt 8:00 a.m., Dr. Noe Espinola (\"Dr. Espinola\"), head of the Obstetrics-Gynecology Department of the CMC, was apprised of Corazon's condition by telephone. Upon being informed that Corazon was bleeding profusely, Dr. Espinola ordered immediate hysterectomy. Rogelio was made to sign a \"Consent to Operation.\" [13]\n\nDue to the inclement weather then, Dr. Espinola, who was fetched from his residence by an ambulance, arrived at the CMC about an hour later or at 9:00 a.m. He examined the patient and ordered some resuscitative measures to be administered. Despite Dr. Espinola's efforts, Corazon died at 9:15 a.m. The cause of death was \"hemorrhage, post partum.\" [14]\n\nOn 14 May 1980, petitioners filed a complaint for damages [15] with the Regional Trial Court [16] of Manila against CMC, Dr. Estrada, Dr. Villaflor, Dr. Uy, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Lacson, Dr. Espinola, and a certain Nurse J. Dumlao for the death of Corazon. Petitioners mainly contended that defendant physicians and CMC personnel were negligent in the treatment and management of Corazon's condition. Petitioners charged CMC with negligence in the selection and supervision of defendant physicians and hospital staff.\n\nFor failing to file their answer to the complaint despite service of summons, the trial court declared Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, and Nurse Dumlao in default. [17] CMC, Dr. Villaflor, Dr. Uy, Dr. Espinola, and Dr. Lacson filed their respective answers denying and opposing the allegations in the complaint. Subsequently, trial ensued.\n\nAfter more than 11 years of trial, the trial court rendered judgment on 22 November 1993 finding Dr. Estrada solely liable for damages. The trial court ruled as follows:\nThe victim was under his pre-natal care, apparently, his fault began from his incorrect and inadequate management and lack of treatment of the pre-eclamptic condition of his patient. It is not disputed that he misapplied the forceps in causing the delivery because it resulted in a large cervical tear which had caused the profuse bleeding which he also failed to control with the application of inadequate injection of magnesium sulfate by his assistant Dra. Ely Villaflor. Dr. Estrada even failed to notice the erroneous administration by nurse Dumlao of hemacel by way of side drip, instead of direct intravenous injection, and his failure to consult a senior obstetrician at an early stage of the problem.\n\nOn the part however of Dra. Ely Villaflor, Dra. Rosa Uy, Dr. Joel Enriquez, Dr. Lacson, Dr. Espinola, nurse J. Dumlao and CMC, the Court finds no legal justification to find them civilly liable.\n\nOn the part of Dra. Ely Villaflor, she was only taking orders from Dr. Estrada, the principal physician of Corazon Nogales. She can only make suggestions in the manner the patient maybe treated but she cannot impose her will as to do so would be to substitute her good judgment to that of Dr. Estrada. If she failed to correctly diagnose the true cause of the bleeding which in this case appears to be a cervical laceration, it cannot be safely concluded by the Court that Dra. Villaflor had the correct diagnosis and she failed to inform Dr. Estrada. No evidence was introduced to show that indeed Dra. Villaflor had discovered that there was laceration at the cervical area of the patient's internal organ.\n\nOn the part of nurse Dumlao, there is no showing that when she administered the hemacel as a side drip, she did it on her own. If the correct procedure was directly thru the veins, it could only be because this was what was probably the orders of Dr. Estrada.\n\nWhile the evidence of the plaintiffs shows that Dr. Noe Espinola, who was the Chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology who attended to the patient Mrs. Nogales, it was only at 9:00 a.m. That he was able to reach the hospital because of typhoon Didang (Exhibit 2). While he was able to give prescription in the manner Corazon Nogales may be treated, the prescription was based on the information given to him by phone and he acted on the basis of facts as presented to him, believing in good faith that such is the correct remedy. He was not with Dr. Estrada when the patient was brought to the hospital at 2:30 o'clock a.m. So, whatever errors that Dr. Estrada committed on the patient before 9:00 o'clock a.m. are certainly the errors of Dr. Estrada and cannot be the mistake of Dr. Noe Espinola. His failure to come to the hospital on time was due to fortuitous event.\n\nOn the part of Dr. Joel Enriquez, while he was present in the delivery room, it is not incumbent upon him to call the attention of Dr. Estrada, Dra. Villaflor and also of Nurse Dumlao on the alleged errors committed by them. Besides, as anesthesiologist, he has no authority to control the actuations of Dr. Estrada and Dra. Villaflor. For the Court to assume that there were errors being committed in the presence of Dr. Enriquez would be to dwell on conjectures and speculations.\n\nOn the civil liability of Dr. Perpetua Lacson, [s]he is a hematologist and in-charge of the blood bank of the CMC. The Court cannot accept the theory of the plaintiffs that there was delay in delivering the blood needed by the patient. It was testified, that in order that this blood will be made available, a laboratory test has to be conducted to determine the type of blood, cross matching and other matters consistent with medical science so, the lapse of 30 minutes maybe considered a reasonable time to do all of these things, and not a delay as the plaintiffs would want the Court to believe.\n\nAdmittedly, Dra. Rosa Uy is a resident physician of the Capitol Medical Center. She was sued because of her alleged failure to notice the incompetence and negligence of Dr. Estrada. However, there is no evidence to support such theory. No evidence was adduced to show that Dra. Rosa Uy as a resident physician of Capitol Medical Center, had knowledge of the mismanagement of the patient Corazon Nogales, and that notwithstanding such knowledge, she tolerated the same to happen.\n\nIn the pre-trial order, plaintiffs and CMC agreed that defendant CMC did not have any hand or participation in the selection or hiring of Dr. Estrada or his assistant Dra. Ely Villaflor as attending physician[s] of the deceased. In other words, the two (2) doctors were not employees of the hospital and therefore the hospital did not have control over their professional conduct. When Mrs. Nogales was brought to the hospital, it was an emergency case and defendant CMC had no choice but to admit her. Such being the case, there is therefore no legal ground to apply the provisions of Article 2176 and 2180 of the New Civil Code referring to the vicarious liability of an employer for the negligence of its employees. If ever in this case there is fault or negligence in the treatment of the deceased on the part of the attending physicians who were employed by the family of the deceased, such civil liability should be borne by the attending physicians under the principle of \"respondeat superior\".\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding defendant Dr. Estrada of Number 13 Pitimini St. San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City civilly liable to pay plaintiffs: 1) By way of actual damages in the amount of P105,000.00; 2) By way of moral damages in the amount of P700,000.00; 3) Attorney's fees in the amount of P100,000.00 and to pay the costs of suit.\n\nFor failure of the plaintiffs to adduce evidence to support its [sic] allegations against the other defendants, the complaint is hereby ordered dismissed. While the Court looks with disfavor the filing of the present complaint against the other defendants by the herein plaintiffs, as in a way it has caused them personal inconvenience and slight damage on their name and reputation, the Court cannot accepts [sic] however, the theory of the remaining defendants that plaintiffs were motivated in bad faith in the filing of this complaint. For this reason defendants' counterclaims are hereby ordered dismissed.\n\nSO ORDERED. [18] Petitioners appealed the trial court's decision. Petitioners claimed that aside from Dr. Estrada, the remaining respondents should be held equally liable for negligence. Petitioners pointed out the extent of each respondent's alleged liability.\n\nOn 6 February 1998, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court. [19] Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration which the Court of Appeals denied in its Resolution of 21 March 2000. [20]\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nMeanwhile, petitioners filed a Manifestation dated 12 April 2002 [21] stating that respondents Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao \"need no longer be notified of the petition because they are absolutely not involved in the issue raised before the [Court], regarding the liability of [CMC].\" [22] Petitioners stressed that the subject matter of this petition is the liability of CMC for the negligence of Dr. Estrada. [23]\n\nThe Court issued a Resolution dated 9 September 2002 [24] dispensing with the requirement to submit the correct and present addresses of respondents Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao. The Court stated that with the filing of petitioners' Manifestation, it should be understood that they are claiming only against respondents CMC, Dr. Espinola, Dr. Lacson, and Dr. Uy who have filed their respective comments. Petitioners are foregoing further claims against respondents Dr. Estrada, Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao.\n\nThe Court noted that Dr. Estrada did not appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals, affirming the trial court's judgment, is already final as against Dr. Oscar Estrada.\n\nPetitioners filed a motion for reconsideration [25] of the Court's 9 September 2002 Resolution claiming that Dr. Enriquez, Dr. Villaflor and Nurse Dumlao were notified of the petition at their counsels' last known addresses. Petitioners reiterated their imputation of negligence on these respondents. The Court denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration in its 18 February 2004 Resolution. [26]\n\nThe Court of Appeals' Ruling\n\nIn its Decision of 6 February 1998, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's ruling. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' view that the doctrine in Darling v. Charleston Community Memorial Hospital [27] applies to this case. According to the Court of Appeals, the present case differs from the Darling case since Dr. Estrada is an independent contractor-physician whereas the Darling case involved a physician and a nurse who were employees of the hospital.\n\nCiting other American cases, the Court of Appeals further held that the mere fact that a hospital permitted a physician to practice medicine and use its facilities is not sufficient to render the hospital liable for the physician's negligence. [28] A hospital is not responsible for the negligence of a physician who is an independent contractor. [29]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found the cases of Davidson v. Conole [30] and Campbell v. Emma Laing Stevens Hospital [31] applicable to this case. Quoting Campbell, the Court of Appeals stated that where there is no proof that defendant physician was an employee of defendant hospital or that defendant hospital had reason to know that any acts of malpractice would take place, defendant hospital could not be held liable for its failure to intervene in the relationship of physician-patient between defendant physician and plaintiff.\n\nOn the liability of the other respondents, the Court of Appeals applied the \"borrowed servant\" doctrine considering that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor who was merely exercising hospital privileges. This doctrine provides that once the surgeon enters the operating room and takes charge of the proceedings, the acts or omissions of operating room personnel, and any negligence associated with such acts or omissions, are imputable to the surgeon. [32] While the assisting physicians and nurses may be employed by the hospital, or engaged by the patient, they normally become the temporary servants or agents of the surgeon in charge while the operation is in progress, and liability may be imposed upon the surgeon for their negligent acts under the doctrine of respondeat superior . [33]\n\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that since Rogelio engaged Dr. Estrada as the attending physician of his wife, any liability for malpractice must be Dr. Estrada's sole responsibility.\n\nWhile it found the amount of damages fair and reasonable, the Court of Appeals held that no interest could be imposed on unliquidated claims or damages.\n\nThe Issue\n\nBasically, the issue in this case is whether CMC is vicariously liable for the negligence of Dr. Estrada. The resolution of this issue rests, on the other hand, on the ascertainment of the relationship between Dr. Estrada and CMC. The Court also believes that a determination of the extent of liability of the other respondents is inevitable to finally and completely dispose of the present controversy.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\n\nOn the Liability of CMC\n\nDr. Estrada's negligence in handling the treatment and management of Corazon's condition which ultimately resulted in Corazon's death is no longer in issue. Dr. Estrada did not appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the ruling of the trial court finding Dr. Estrada solely liable for damages. Accordingly, the finding of the trial court on Dr. Estrada's negligence is already final.\n\nPetitioners maintain that CMC is vicariously liable for Dr. Estrada's negligence based on Article 2180 in relation to Article 2176 of the Civil Code. These provisions pertinently state:\nArt. 2180. The obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.\n\nx x x x\n\nEmployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage.\n\nArt. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter. Similarly, in the United States, a hospital which is the employer, master, or principal of a physician employee, servant, or agent, may be held liable for the physician's negligence under the doctrine of respondeat superior . [34]\n\nIn the present case, petitioners maintain that CMC, in allowing Dr. Estrada to practice and admit patients at CMC, should be liable for Dr. Estrada's malpractice. Rogelio claims that he knew Dr. Estrada as an accredited physician of CMC, though he discovered later that Dr. Estrada was not a salaried employee of the CMC. [35] Rogelio further claims that he was dealing with CMC, whose primary concern was the treatment and management of his wife's condition. Dr. Estrada just happened to be the specific person he talked to representing CMC. [36] Moreover, the fact that CMC made Rogelio sign a Consent on Admission and Admission Agreement [37] and a Consent to Operation printed on the letterhead of CMC indicates that CMC considered Dr. Estrada as a member of its medical staff.\n\nOn the other hand, CMC disclaims liability by asserting that Dr. Estrada was a mere visiting physician and that it admitted Corazon because her physical condition then was classified an emergency obstetrics case. [38]\n\nCMC alleges that Dr. Estrada is an independent contractor \"for whose actuations CMC would be a total stranger.\" CMC maintains that it had no control or supervision over Dr. Estrada in the exercise of his medical profession.\n\nThe Court had the occasion to determine the relationship between a hospital and a consultant or visiting physician and the liability of such hospital for that physician's negligence in Ramos v. Court of Appeals, [39] to wit:\nIn the first place, hospitals exercise significant control in the hiring and firing of consultants and in the conduct of their work within the hospital premises. Doctors who apply for \"consultant\" slots, visiting or attending, are required to submit proof of completion of residency, their educational qualifications; generally, evidence of accreditation by the appropriate board (diplomate), evidence of fellowship in most cases, and references. These requirements are carefully scrutinized by members of the hospital administration or by a review committee set up by the hospital who either accept or reject the application. This is particularly true with respondent hospital.\n\nAfter a physician is accepted, either as a visiting or attending consultant, he is normally required to attend clinico-pathological conferences, conduct bedside rounds for clerks, interns and residents, moderate grand rounds and patient audits and perform other tasks and responsibilities, for the privilege of being able to maintain a clinic in the hospital, and/or for the privilege of admitting patients into the hospital. In addition to these, the physician's performance as a specialist is generally evaluated by a peer review committee on the basis of mortality and morbidity statistics, and feedback from patients, nurses, interns and residents. A consultant remiss in his duties, or a consultant who regularly falls short of the minimum standards acceptable to the hospital or its peer review committee, is normally politely terminated.\n\nIn other words, private hospitals, hire, fire and exercise real control over their attending and visiting \"consultant\" staff. While \"consultants\" are not, technically employees, a point which respondent hospital asserts in denying all responsibility for the patient's condition, the control exercised, the hiring, and the right to terminate consultants all fulfill the important hallmarks of an employer-employee relationship, with the exception of the payment of wages. In assessing whether such a relationship in fact exists, the control test is determining. Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, we rule that for the purpose of allocating responsibility in medical negligence cases, an employer-employee relationship in effect exists between hospitals and their attending and visiting physicians. This being the case, the question now arises as to whether or not respondent hospital is solidarily liable with respondent doctors for petitioner's condition.\n\nThe basis for holding an employer solidarily responsible for the negligence of its employee is found in Article 2180 of the Civil Code which considers a person accountable not only for his own acts but also for those of others based on the former's responsibility under a relationship of patria potestas. x x x [40] (Emphasis supplied) While the Court in Ramos did not expound on the control test, such test essentially determines whether an employment relationship exists between a physician and a hospital based on the exercise of control over the physician as to details. Specifically, the employer (or the hospital) must have the right to control both the means and the details of the process by which the employee (or the physician) is to accomplish his task. [41]\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the voluminous records of this case, the Court finds no single evidence pointing to CMC's exercise of control over Dr. Estrada's treatment and management of Corazon's condition. It is undisputed that throughout Corazon's pregnancy, she was under the exclusive prenatal care of Dr. Estrada. At the time of Corazon's admission at CMC and during her delivery, it was Dr. Estrada, assisted by Dr. Villaflor, who attended to Corazon. There was no showing that CMC had a part in diagnosing Corazon's condition. While Dr. Estrada enjoyed staff privileges at CMC, such fact alone did not make him an employee of CMC. [42] CMC merely allowed Dr. Estrada to use its facilities [43] when Corazon was about to give birth, which CMC considered an emergency. Considering these circumstances, Dr. Estrada is not an employee of CMC, but an independent contractor.\n\nThe question now is whether CMC is automatically exempt from liability considering that Dr. Estrada is an independent contractor-physician.\n\nIn general, a hospital is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor-physician. There is, however, an exception to this principle. The hospital may be liable if the physician is the \"ostensible\" agent of the hospital. [44] This exception is also known as the \"doctrine of apparent authority.\" [45] In Gilbert v. Sycamore Municipal Hospital , [46] the Illinois Supreme Court explained the doctrine of apparent authority in this wise:\n[U]nder the doctrine of apparent authority a hospital can be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of a physician providing care at the hospital, regardless of whether the physician is an independent contractor, unless the patient knows, or should have known, that the physician is an independent contractor. The elements of the action have been set out as follows:\n\n\"For a hospital to be liable under the doctrine of apparent authority, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the hospital, or its agent, acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual who was alleged to be negligent was an employee or agent of the hospital; (2) where the acts of the agent create the appearance of authority, the plaintiff must also prove that the hospital had knowledge of and acquiesced in them; and (3) the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the conduct of the hospital or its agent, consistent with ordinary care and prudence.\"\n\nThe element of \"holding out\" on the part of the hospital does not require an express representation by the hospital that the person alleged to be negligent is an employee. Rather, the element is satisfied if the hospital holds itself out as a provider of emergency room care without informing the patient that the care is provided by independent contractors.\n\nThe element of justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff is satisfied if the plaintiff relies upon the hospital to provide complete emergency room care, rather than upon a specific physician. The doctrine of apparent authority essentially involves two factors to determine the liability of an independent-contractor physician.\n\nThe first factor focuses on the hospital's manifestations and is sometimes described as an inquiry whether the hospital acted in a manner which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual who was alleged to be negligent was an employee or agent of the hospital. [47] In this regard, the hospital need not make express representations to the patient that the treating physician is an employee of the hospital; rather a representation may be general and implied. [48]\n\nThe doctrine of apparent authority is a species of the doctrine of estoppel. Article 1431 of the Civil Code provides that \"[t]hrough estoppel, an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon.\" Estoppel rests on this rule: \"Whenever a party has, by his own declaration, act, or omission, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true, and to act upon such belief, he cannot, in any litigation arising out of such declaration, act or omission, be permitted to falsify it.\" [49]\n\nIn the instant case, CMC impliedly held out Dr. Estrada as a member of its medical staff. Through CMC's acts, CMC clothed Dr. Estrada with apparent authority thereby leading the Spouses Nogales to believe that Dr. Estrada was an employee or agent of CMC. CMC cannot now repudiate such authority.\n\nFirst, CMC granted staff privileges to Dr. Estrada. CMC extended its medical staff and facilities to Dr. Estrada. Upon Dr. Estrada's request for Corazon's admission, CMC, through its personnel, readily accommodated Corazon and updated Dr. Estrada of her condition.\n\nSecond, CMC made Rogelio sign consent forms printed on CMC letterhead. Prior to Corazon's admission and supposed hysterectomy, CMC asked Rogelio to sign release forms, the contents of which reinforced Rogelio's belief that Dr. Estrada was a member of CMC's medical staff. [50] The Consent on Admission and Agreement explicitly provides:\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:\nI, Rogelio Nogales, of legal age, a resident of 1974 M. H. Del Pilar St., Malate Mla., being the father/mother/brother/sister/spouse/relative/ guardian/or person in custody of Ma. Corazon, and representing his/her family, of my own volition and free will, do consent and submit said Ma. Corazon to Dr. Oscar Estrada (hereinafter referred to as Physician) for cure, treatment, retreatment, or emergency measures, that the Physician, personally or by and through the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff, may use, adapt, or employ such means, forms or methods of cure, treatment, retreatment, or emergency measures as he may see best and most expedient; that Ma. Corazon and I will comply with any and all rules, regulations, directions, and instructions of the Physician, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff; and, that I will not hold liable or responsible and hereby waive and forever discharge and hold free the Physician, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff, from any and all claims of whatever kind of nature, arising from directly or indirectly, or by reason of said cure, treatment, or retreatment, or emergency measures or intervention of said physician, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff.\n\nx x x x [51] (Emphasis supplied) While the Consent to Operation pertinently reads, thus:\nI, ROGELIO NOGALES, x x x, of my own volition and free will, do consent and submit said CORAZON NOGALES to Hysterectomy, by the Surgical Staff and Anesthesiologists of Capitol Medical Center and/or whatever succeeding operations, treatment, or emergency measures as may be necessary and most expedient; and, that I will not hold liable or responsible and hereby waive and forever discharge and hold free the Surgeon, his assistants, anesthesiologists, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff, from any and all claims of whatever kind of nature, arising from directly or indirectly, or by reason of said operation or operations, treatment, or emergency measures, or intervention of the Surgeon, his assistants, anesthesiologists, the Capitol Medical Center and/or its staff. [52] (Emphasis supplied) Without any indication in these consent forms that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor-physician, the Spouses Nogales could not have known that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor. Significantly, no one from CMC informed the Spouses Nogales that Dr. Estrada was an independent contractor. On the contrary, Dr. Atencio, who was then a member of CMC Board of Directors, testified that Dr. Estrada was part of CMC's surgical staff. [53]\n\nThird, Dr. Estrada's referral of Corazon's profuse vaginal bleeding to Dr. Espinola, who was then the Head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of CMC, gave the impression that Dr. Estrada as a member of CMC's medical staff was collaborating with other CMC-employed specialists in treating Corazon.\n\nThe second factor focuses on the patient's reliance. It is sometimes characterized as an inquiry on whether the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the conduct of the hospital or its agent , consistent with ordinary care and prudence. [54]\n\nThe records show that the Spouses Nogales relied upon a perceived employment relationship with CMC in accepting Dr. Estrada's services. Rogelio testified that he and his wife specifically chose Dr. Estrada to handle Corazon's delivery not only because of their friend's recommendation, but more importantly because of Dr. Estrada's \"connection with a reputable hospital, the [CMC].\" [55] In other words, Dr. Estrada's relationship with CMC played a significant role in the Spouses Nogales' decision in accepting Dr. Estrada's services as the obstetrician-gynecologist for Corazon's delivery. Moreover, as earlier stated, there is no showing that before and during Corazon's confinement at CMC, the Spouses Nogales knew or should have known that Dr. Estrada was not an employee of CMC.\n\nFurther, the Spouses Nogales looked to CMC to provide the best medical care and support services for Corazon's delivery. The Court notes that prior to Corazon's fourth pregnancy, she used to give birth inside a clinic. Considering Corazon's age then, the Spouses Nogales decided to have their fourth child delivered at CMC, which Rogelio regarded one of the best hospitals at the time. [56] This is precisely because the Spouses Nogales feared that Corazon might experience complications during her delivery which would be better addressed and treated in a modern and big hospital such as CMC. Moreover, Rogelio's consent in Corazon's hysterectomy to be performed by a different physician, namely Dr. Espinola, is a clear indication of Rogelio's confidence in CMC's surgical staff.\n\nCMC's defense that all it did was \"to extend to [Corazon] its facilities\" is untenable. The Court cannot close its eyes to the reality that hospitals, such as CMC, are in the business of treatment. In this regard, the Court agrees with the observation made by the Court of Appeals of North Carolina in Diggs v. Novant Health, Inc., [57] to wit:\n\"The conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat the patient, does not undertake to act through its doctors and nurses, but undertakes instead simply to procure them to act upon their own responsibility, no longer reflects the fact. Present day hospitals, as their manner of operation plainly demonstrates, do far more than furnish facilities for treatment. They regularly employ on a salary basis a large staff of physicians, nurses and internes [sic], as well as administrative and manual workers, and they charge patients for medical care and treatment, collecting for such services, if necessary, by legal action. Certainly, the person who avails himself of 'hospital facilities' expects that the hospital will attempt to cure him, not that its nurses or other employees will act on their own responsibility.\" x x x (Emphasis supplied) Likewise unconvincing is CMC's argument that petitioners are estopped from claiming damages based on the Consent on Admission and Consent to Operation. Both release forms consist of two parts. The first part gave CMC permission to administer to Corazon any form of recognized medical treatment which the CMC medical staff deemed advisable. The second part of the documents, which may properly be described as the releasing part, releases CMC and its employees \"from any and all claims\" arising from or by reason of the treatment and operation.\n\nThe documents do not expressly release CMC from liability for injury to Corazon due to negligence during her treatment or operation. Neither do the consent forms expressly exempt CMC from liability for Corazon's death due to negligence during such treatment or operation. Such release forms, being in the nature of contracts of adhesion, are construed strictly against hospitals. Besides, a blanket release in favor of hospitals \"from any and all claims,\" which includes claims due to bad faith or gross negligence, would be contrary to public policy and thus void.\n\nEven simple negligence is not subject to blanket release in favor of establishments like hospitals but may only mitigate liability depending on the circumstances. [58] When a person needing urgent medical attention rushes to a hospital, he cannot bargain on equal footing with the hospital on the terms of admission and operation. Such a person is literally at the mercy of the hospital. There can be no clearer example of a contract of adhesion than one arising from such a dire situation. Thus, the release forms of CMC cannot relieve CMC from liability for the negligent medical treatment of Corazon.\n\nOn the Liability of the Other Respondents\n\nDespite this Court's pronouncement in its 9 September 2002 [59] Resolution that the filing of petitioners' Manifestation confined petitioners' claim only against CMC, Dr. Espinola, Dr. Lacson, and Dr. Uy, who have filed their comments, the Court deems it proper to resolve the individual liability of the remaining respondents to put an end finally to this more than two-decade old controversy.\n\na) Dr. Ely Villaflor\n\nPetitioners blame Dr. Ely Villaflor for failing to diagnose the cause of Corazon's bleeding and to suggest the correct remedy to Dr. Estrada. [60] Petitioners assert that it was Dr. Villaflor's duty to correct the error of Nurse Dumlao in the administration of hemacel.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. Dr. Villaflor admitted administering a lower dosage of magnesium sulfate. However, this was after informing Dr. Estrada that Corazon was no longer in convulsion and that her blood pressure went down to a dangerous level. [61] At that moment, Dr. Estrada instructed Dr. Villaflor to reduce the dosage of magnesium sulfate from 10 to 2.5 grams. Since petitioners did not dispute Dr. Villaflor's allegation, Dr. Villaflor's defense remains uncontroverted. Dr. Villaflor's act of administering a lower dosage of magnesium sulfate was not out of her own volition or was in contravention of Dr. Estrada's order.\n\nb) Dr. Rosa Uy\n\nDr. Rosa Uy's alleged negligence consisted of her failure (1) to call the attention of Dr. Estrada on the incorrect dosage of magnesium sulfate administered by Dr. Villaflor; (2) to take corrective measures; and (3) to correct Nurse Dumlao's wrong method of hemacel administration.\n\nThe Court believes Dr. Uy's claim that as a second year resident physician then at CMC, she was merely authorized to take the clinical history and physical examination of Corazon. [62] However, that routine internal examination did not ipso facto make Dr. Uy liable for the errors committed by Dr. Estrada. Further, petitioners' imputation of negligence rests on their baseless assumption that Dr. Uy was present at the delivery room. Nothing shows that Dr. Uy participated in delivering Corazon's baby. Further, it is unexpected from Dr. Uy, a mere resident physician at that time, to call the attention of a more experienced specialist, if ever she was present at the delivery room.\n\nc) Dr. Joel Enriquez\n\nPetitioners fault Dr. Joel Enriquez also for not calling the attention of Dr. Estrada, Dr. Villaflor, and Nurse Dumlao about their errors. [63] Petitioners insist that Dr. Enriquez should have taken, or at least suggested, corrective measures to rectify such errors.\n\nThe Court is not convinced. Dr. Enriquez is an anesthesiologist whose field of expertise is definitely not obstetrics and gynecology. As such, Dr. Enriquez was not expected to correct Dr. Estrada's errors. Besides, there was no evidence of Dr. Enriquez's knowledge of any error committed by Dr. Estrada and his failure to act upon such observation.\n\nd) Dr. Perpetua Lacson\n\nPetitioners fault Dr. Perpetua Lacson for her purported delay in the delivery of blood Corazon needed. [64] Petitioners claim that Dr. Lacson was remiss in her duty of supervising the blood bank staff.\n\nAs found by the trial court, there was no unreasonable delay in the delivery of blood from the time of the request until the transfusion to Corazon. Dr. Lacson competently explained the procedure before blood could be given to the patient. [65] Taking into account the bleeding time, clotting time and cross-matching, Dr. Lacson stated that it would take approximately 45-60 minutes before blood could be ready for transfusion. [66] Further, no evidence exists that Dr. Lacson neglected her duties as head of the blood bank.\n\ne) Dr. Noe Espinola\n\nPetitioners argue that Dr. Espinola should not have ordered immediate hysterectomy without determining the underlying cause of Corazon's bleeding. Dr. Espinola should have first considered the possibility of cervical injury, and advised a thorough examination of the cervix, instead of believing outright Dr. Estrada's diagnosis that the cause of bleeding was uterine atony.\n\nDr. Espinola's order to do hysterectomy which was based on the information he received by phone is not negligence. The Court agrees with the trial court's observation that Dr. Espinola, upon hearing such information about Corazon's condition, believed in good faith that hysterectomy was the correct remedy. At any rate, the hysterectomy did not push through because upon Dr. Espinola's arrival, it was already too late. At the time, Corazon was practically dead.\n\nf) Nurse J. Dumlao\n\nIn Moore v. Guthrie Hospital Inc., [67] the US Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, held that to recover, a patient complaining of injuries allegedly resulting when the nurse negligently injected medicine to him intravenously instead of intramuscularly had to show that (1) an intravenous injection constituted a lack of reasonable and ordinary care; (2) the nurse injected medicine intravenously; and (3) such injection was the proximate cause of his injury.\n\nIn the present case, there is no evidence of Nurse Dumlao's alleged failure to follow Dr. Estrada's specific instructions. Even assuming Nurse Dumlao defied Dr. Estrada's order, there is no showing that side-drip administration of hemacel proximately caused Corazon's death. No evidence linking Corazon's death and the alleged wrongful hemacel administration was introduced. Therefore, there is no basis to hold Nurse Dumlao liable for negligence.\n\nOn the Award of Interest on Damages\n\nThe award of interest on damages is proper and allowed under Article 2211 of the Civil Code, which states that in crimes and quasi-delicts, interest as a part of the damages may, in a proper case, be adjudicated in the discretion of the court. [68]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court PARTLY GRANTS the petition. The Court finds respondent Capitol Medical Center vicariously liable for the negligence of Dr. Oscar Estrada. The amounts of P105,000 as actual damages and P700,000 as moral damages should each earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum computed from the date of the judgment of the trial court. The Court affirms the rest of the Decision dated 6 February 1998 and Resolution dated 21 March 2000 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Finally, the third party must accept the services of the agent in reliance upon the perceived relationship between the agent and the principal.(emphasis supplied and internal citations omitted) [50] In Gilbert v.

However, I do not agree with the additional pronouncements made by the ponencia that (1) the sale of the subject land by Alvarez to Oliver as well as by Oliver to Filinvest is valid;[1] (2) the instant case is barred by res judicata because of a prior case filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna for recovery of ownership over the same land; and, (3) any subsequent action, if one should be filed, involving title over the subject land is already barred by res judicata.[2]With due respect, the ponencia might have overlooked the consequences of its finding that the DARAB was without jurisdiction over the instant case. Since the DARAB was without jurisdiction over the instant case, all the proceedings had as well as orders and decisions issued therein were null and void. As a result, the other issues raised by Filinvest could no longer be resolved because of the finding that the DARAB has no jurisdiction to hear the instant case. The declaration of the ponencia validating the sales of the subject land by Alvarez to Oliver as well as by Oliver to Filinvest is thus inappropriate under the circumstances. All that should be done is to order the dismissal of the instant case.Whether the filing of a subsequent case is barred by res judicata is an issue that should be resolved if and when such a subsequent case is filed. The rule is well-settled that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution.[3] The instant case is not the proper forum to rule on the existence of res judicata. To emphasize, the DARAB has no jurisdiction hence all proceedings therein are null and void. Consequently, the issue of res judicata raised therein could not be resolved. It follows that any pronouncement thereon by the ponencia is inappropriate.Indeed, the records of the instant case reveal that a prior action for reconveyance of the subject land was filed by private respondents before the RTC of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna; that the same was dismissed by the trial court for failure to prosecute; and that the order dismissing the RTC case became final and executory for failure of the private respondents to appeal therefrom. But, as previously discussed, the issue of whether the instant case is barred by res judicata because of the filing of a prior RTC case became moot with the finding that the DARAB, to begin with, has no jurisdiction over the instant case.Nevertheless, the ponencia went on to rule on the issue of res judicata and took it a step further by declaring that the dismissal of the RTC case \"would bar any dispute over the subject land from being brought before any judicial forum.\"[4] With due respect, whether Filinvest can validly raise the defense of res judicata in a future, subsequent case involving title over the subject land is a matter of defense which this Court cannot resolve in the instant case without violating the rule that states that the power of adjudication of courts is limited to actual controversies. Such a declaration is premature to say the least. The other party must be allowed to refute the existence of the elements of res judicata in the proper forum at the proper time when it is raised as an issue. But as it is, such subsequent case has yet to be filed. Definitely, the instant case is not the \"subsequent case\" as the DARAB has no jurisdiction to begin with.In fine, the issue of whether the sale of the subject land by Alvarez to Oliver and by Oliver to Filinvest is valid as well as whether a future, subsequent case is barred by res judicata cannot be resolved in the instant case. The only valid and binding ruling in the instant case should be one for dismissal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.ACCORDINGLY, the instant complaint should be DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.[1] The ponencia stated thus:In the present case, the government, through the DAR had already issued an Order of Award and a Deed of Sale in favor if Ricardo Alvarez covering a parcel of land located within the Laguna Resettlement Project, when Presidential Decree No. 1474 was enacted on 11 June 1978. In 1979, Alvarez, with the consent of his spouse, Rosario Param, transferred the same parcel of land to Mercedes Oliver. Such transfer was clearly sanctioned. As earlier adverted to, Section 2 of presidential Decree No. 1474 revoked the application of Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844 and the condition prohibiting the transfer of the land contained in the Deed of Sale executed by the DAR in favor of Alvarez, in so far as land within the Laguna Resettlement Project was concerned. Since the transfer made by Ricardo Alvarez to Mercedes Oliver was valid, the subsequent transfer made by Mercedes Oliver to Filinvest is also valid. (Italics supplied) (Revised Draft Decision, p. 10)[2] The ponencia stated thus:Having complied with the four requisites needed for the doctrine of res judicata to operate, the Order rendered by the RTC of Bi\u00f1an dismissing Civil Case No. B-1941 finally determined the ownership of the subject land, the heirs of the late Ricardo Alvarez, Mercedes Oliver, and her successor-in-interest, Filinvest, as no motion for reconsideration on this Order was filed. Moreover, this would bar any dispute over the subject land from being brought before any judicial forum. (Italics supplied) (Revised Draft Decision, p. 15-16)[3] Republic v. Tan, G.R.

DE ALVAREZ, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to set aside a Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated 11 November 1998 in CA\u2013G.R. SP No. 48396 annulling the sale of a parcel of land specified as Lot No. 329, GSS-877 of the Laguna Resettlement Project, to the late Ricardo Alvarez and the subsequent transfers to Mercedes Oliver and petitioner Filinvest Land Inc. (Filinvest); and the reversion of the subject property to the ownership of the government. The Court of Appeals in its assailed Decision affirmed the Decision [2] of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) dated 1 July 1998.\n\nThe subject matter in this case is a parcel of land registered as Lot No. 329 of the Laguna Resettlement Project, located in Barrio San Vicente, San Pedro, Laguna, with an area of 16,495 square meters. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) awarded to Ricardo Alvarez the right to purchase the land in question, pursuant to an Order of Award dated 9 October 1973. [3] On 15 August 1977, Ricardo Alvarez, with the consent of his wife, respondent Rosario Param, purchased the land, evidenced by a Deed of Sale executed by the DAR. [4] This Deed of Sale specifically prohibited the transfer of the land within ten (10) years from the issuance of the certificate of title to any person other than the vendee's relatives within the third civil degree by consanguinity or affinity who are, at the same time, qualified beneficiaries. [5] This restriction was in accordance with Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844, or the Agricultural Land Reform Code. [6]\n\nHowever, pending the issuance of the certificate of title of the said land, Presidential Decree No. 1474, Declaring the San Pedro Tunasan Estate (also known as the Laguna Resettlement Project) of the Department of Agrarian Reform Suitable for Residential, Commercial, or Industrial, or other Non-Agricultural Purposes, was enacted on 11 June 1978 and published in the Official Gazette on 27 November 1978. This effectively repealed the ten-year prohibition on the transfer of agrarian lands situated in the Laguna Resettlement Project. Presidential Decree No. 1474 provided that:\nSection 1. The Department of Agrarian Reform, as Administrator of the San Pedro Tunasan Estate, is hereby ordered to convert such estate into a commercial, industrial and residential site and to transfer the same to the National Housing Authority.\n\nSection 2. Individuals who have legally acquired farm lots in the Estate under Orders of Award or Certificates of Land Transfer or Agreement to Sell or Deeds of Sale, may sell or transfer their lots covered thereby or convert the same for the purposes mentioned in Section 1 hereof. The Register of Deeds of the Province of Laguna issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 62731, covering the subject land, in the name of Ricardo Alvarez on 25 May 1979. On 10 June 1979, only 16 days after the title was issued, Ricardo Alvarez and his wife, Rosario Param, sold the said land to Mercedes Oliver for Ten Thousand Pesos (P10, 000.00). Oliver was not a relative within the third degree of consanguinity and had no capacity to personally cultivate the land, as required of a qualified beneficiary. Thus, TCT No. 62731 was cancelled, and TCT No. 64967 was issued in the name of Mercedes Oliver. [7]\n\nOn 22 December 1989, Mercedes Oliver sold the subject land to Filinvest, resulting in the issuance of TCT No. 201836 on 23 January 1990 in the name of Filinvest. [8]\n\nOn 7 March 1982, the heirs of the late Ricardo Alvarez filed a case for reconveyance, redemption and damages against Mercedes Oliver, Avelino Ramos and Jose Nunez, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna. [9] Respondents filed an Amended Complaint for Annulment of Title with Reconveyance, dated 4 December 1985, wherein they claim that the sale of the subject land was made without their knowledge, and it was only in the 1980's that they learned of such sale. They alleged that their mother and father, both illiterate, were deceived by the defendants into executing the Deed of Sale covering the subject land in favor of Mercedes Oliver. Respondents also argued that such sale was void since the Deed of Sale was executed in violation of the law which enjoins the sale of the subject land. [10] This case was, however, dismissed for failure of the respondents and counsel to appear during the hearing for the reception of their evidence, despite due notice and after eight postponements [11] . The RTC, in its Order, [12] dated 17 February 1989, ruled that:\nFurther considering that without the evidence of said witness and the plaintiffs not having presented any evidence on record, upon motion of counsel for defendants that this case be dismissed and further manifestation by the defendants that they are waiving their right to a counterclaim, the Court hereby orders the dismissal of this case (both the complaint and counterclaim).\n\nLet copy of this Order be furnished party plaintiff. The order became final and executory when the respondents failed to file a motion for reconsideration of this Order, despite receipt thereof. [13]\n\nOn 26 March 1990, respondents filed a complaint against Mercedes Oliver and Filinvest before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication (PARAD) of Sta. Cruz, Laguna, seeking to annul the Deed of Sale between the Spouses Alvarez and Mercedes Oliver and the subsequent transfer between Mercedes Oliver and Filinvest, on grounds similar to the complaint filed before the RTC of Bi\u00f1an. They also sought the issuance of a restraining order enjoining Filinvest from bulldozing the subject land, which was occupied and cultivated by the respondents. Mercedes Oliver filed a Motion to Dismiss on the grounds of res judicata and that the PARAD had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. Filinvest similarly filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of res judicata and laches. It also alleged, in its defense, that it was a purchaser for value and in good faith. In its Position Paper, Filinvest likewise asserted that the restriction against selling the subject land within ten years, provided under the Deed of Sale executed by DAR in favor of the Spouses Alvarez had already been superseded by Presidential Decree No. 1474, which took effect in 1978. [14]\n\nOn 25 August 1993, the PARAD of Sta. Cruz, Laguna, dismissed the complaint on the ground of res judicata . Moreover, it ruled that the sale between the Spouses Alvarez and Mercedes Oliver was valid. [15] The dispositive part of this Decision [16] reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view therefrom, Judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the instant case for lack of merit. On appeal, the DARAB reversed and set aside the Decision dismissing the complaint, and ordered the reversion of the subject property to the government. The dispositive portion of the said Order, [17] dated 1 July 1998 reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the challenged decision dated August 25, 1993 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new judgment is hereby rendered as follows:\nAnnulling the transfer of the land in question to the late Ricardo Alvarez and its subsequent transfers to defendant Mercedes Oliver and defendant Filinvest Land Incorporated;\n\nOrdering the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 201836, covering the subject land, issued by the Register of Deeds for the Province of Laguna, Calamba branch, in the name of defendant Filinvest; and\n\nDirecting the Register of Deeds for the Province of Laguna, Calamba branch, to issue in lieu of TCT No. 201836, a Certificate of Title in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, through DAR, for distribution to qualified farmer-beneficiary in accordance with Administrative Order No. 01, Series of 1992, which is the Revised Rules and Procedures Governing the Disposition of Homelots and other Lots in Barangay Sites and Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Lots in Townsites within DAR Settlement Project and Similar Other Areas under DAR Jurisdiction. The DARAB ruled, too, that res judicata as a bar against filing a complaint with the PARAD is not applicable in this case since there was no adjudication of the merits before the RTC of Bi\u00f1an.\n\nThe DARAB considered as self-serving and unsupported by evidence the allegations of the respondents that the consent of the Spouses Alvarez was obtained through fraud in connection with the sale made in favor of Mercedes Oliver. It also ruled that the sale between Ricardo Alvarez and Mercedes Oliver was a violation of the ten-year prohibition against the transfer of the land imposed by the Deed of Sale between the government and Ricardo Alvarez, in accordance with Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844. Such act rendered the Deed of Sale executed by the DAR in favor of Ricardo Alvarez void, and, therefore, the subsequent transfers to Mercedes Oliver and Filinvest were, likewise, void. [18]\n\nIn negating Filinvest's claim that Presidential Decree No. 1474 has superseded Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844, the DARAB cited the case of Tipon v. Intermediate Appellate Court, [19] where the Court upheld the validity of the ten-year prohibition on the transfer of land given by the government to farmer-beneficiaries. The DARAB added that the restriction on transfer of land is contained in our present agrarian laws, particularly Republic Act No. 6675. [20]\n\nThe petitioners then filed a Petition for Certiorari under Section 43 of the 1997 Rules of Court before the Court of Appeals, but on 11 November 1998, the appeal was again dismissed for lack of merit and the assailed Decision of the DARAB was affirmed. [21]\n\nThe petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was subsequently denied in a Resolution dated 8 February 1999. [22]\n\nHence this petition, wherein Filinvest raised the following issues:\nI\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AND COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN HOLDING THAT THE SALE OF THE SUBJECT PARCEL OF LAND BY RICARDO ALVAREZ TO MERCEDES OLIVER VIOLATED THE TRANSFER RESTRICTION CONTAINED IN THE PRIOR DEED OF SALE OF THE SAME PROPERTY EXECUTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM IN FAVOR OF RICARDO ALVAREZ AND SECTION 62, ARTICLE II, CHAPTER III OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 3844\n\nII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN APPLYING SECTION 1 (C), RULE II OF THE NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATION BOARD (DARAB), CONFERRING JURISDICTION OF THE DARAB OVER THE INSTANT CASE, IN DISREGARD OF THE PROVISIONS OF PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 1474\n\nIII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN RULING THAT THE DOCTRINE OF RES JUDICATA DOES NOT APPLY TO BAR RESPONDENTS' COMPLAINT IN DARAB CASE NO. IV-032-L\n\nIV\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN NOT RULING THAT PETITIONER IS A BUYER IN GOOD FAITH WHO SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO PROTECTION AGAINST THE ALLEGED CLAIM OF THE RESPONDENT HEREIN, PURSUANT TO THIS HONORABLE COURT'S RULING IN AGRICULTURAL AND HOME EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT GROUP VS. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. NO. 92319, SEPTEMBER 3, 1992 [23] This petition is meritorious.\n\nThe first issue raised by Filinvest is whether the sale between Ricardo Alvarez and Mercedes Oliver was void because it violated the prohibitory condition contained in the Deed of Sale between Ricardo Alvarez and the Government, to wit:\nThat from the date of the pertinent Order of Award and within TEN (10) years from the date of issuance by the proper Register of Deeds of the certificate of title, the land subject hereof shall not, except by hereditary succession, be subdivided, sold or in any manner transferred or encumbered except in favor of any of the VENDEE'S relative within the third civil degree by consanguinity or affinity who fulfill the four (4) requirements in Section 6 Land Authority Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 1967, or in favor of the Government and its financial or banking institutions or rural banks, and only upon prior written consent of the Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform; and any sale, transfer, encumberance or alienation made in violation hereof shall be null and void: x x x [24] This condition is in accordance with Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844, The Agricultural Land Reform Code, which provided that:\nSection 62. Limitation on Land Rights. - Except in case of hereditary succession by one heir, landholdings acquired under this Code may not be resold, mortgaged, encumbered, or transferred until after the lapse of ten years from the date of full payment and acquisition and after such ten-year period, any transfer, sale or disposition may be made only in favor of persons qualified to acquire economic family-size farm units in accordance with the provisions of this Code: Provided, That a purchaser who acquired his landholding under a contract to sell may secure a loan on the same from any private lending institution or individual for an amount not exceeding his equity on said landholding upon a guaranty by the Land Bank. Filinvest, however, contends that these restrictions were already revoked by the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 1474, Declaring the San Pedro Tunasan Estate of the Department of Agrarian Reform Suitable for Residential, Commercial or Industrial, or Other Non-Agricultural Purposes. This law reclassifies the San Pedro Tunasan Estate, known as and hereinafter referred to as the Laguna Resettlement Project, into a commercial, industrial and residential site as it is no longer conducive to agricultural development.\n\nThe position taken by Filinvest is justified. Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1474 [25] categorically empowers \"individuals who have legally acquired lots in the (San Pedro Tunasan) Estate\" under Orders of Awards or Deeds of Sale, among others things, to \"sell or transfer their lots covered thereby.\" Therefore, transfers of land located within the Laguna Resettlement Project, made after the law took effect, are valid and the restriction on transfer of the land within ten years after its registration is no longer applicable.\n\nIn the present case, the government, through the DAR had already issued an Order of Award and a Deed of Sale in favor of Ricardo Alvarez covering a parcel of land located within the Laguna Resettlement Project, when Presidential Decree No. 1474 was enacted on 11 June 1978. In 1979, Alvarez, with the consent of his spouse, Rosario Param, transferred the same parcel of land to Mercedes Oliver. Such transfer was clearly sanctioned. As earlier adverted to, Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1474 revoked the application of Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844 and the condition prohibiting the transfer of the land contained in the Deed of Sale executed by the DAR in favor of Alvarez, in so far as land within the Laguna Resettlement Project was concerned. Since the transfer made by Ricardo Alvarez to Mercedes Oliver was valid, the subsequent transfer made by Mercedes Oliver to Filinvest is also valid.\n\nDARAB's reliance on the ruling of the Court in Tipon v. Intermediate Appellate Court , [26] upholding the ten-year prohibition on the transfer of land distributed by the government in favor of its beneficiaries, is misplaced. This case is not applicable for it did not take into account Presidential Decree No. 1474 because of different factual circumstances. It is true that the Tipon case shares some similarities with the present case - the subject property was part of the Laguna Resettlement Project, and the Deed of Sale between the DAR and the farmer-beneficiary, Renato Tipon, was executed before the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 1474 in 1978. However, there is a crucial difference. Unlike the present case where the subsequent transfer by the farmer-beneficiary, Ricardo Alvarez, to Mercedes Oliver was made in 1979 after Presidential Decree No. 1474 took effect, the subsequent transfer by farmer-beneficiary Renato Tipon to Atty. Umiral Matic, was made in 1976 before the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 1474. The factual background of the Tipon case, as recounted by the Court, are thus:\nPetitioner Renato Tipon acquired the lot in question (Lot No. 386 of the Laguna Settlement Project) from the government by virtue of a Deed of Sale executed in his favor by the Department of Agrarian Reform on November 23, 1976, for the price of P1,251.20. x x x.\n\nx x x x\n\nOn the day the Deed of Sale was executed in his favor, Tipon filed a request with the Department of Agrarian Reform for permission to transfer his rights and interest over the lot in question in favor of Atty. Umiral P. Matic (respondent herein). This request was granted by the Regional Director of Region IV of the Department of Agrarian Reform on December 9, 1976 \"subject to the condition that the Deed of Transfer is submitted to this department for verification and final approval.\n\nOn December 10, 1976, Tipon submitted the Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of Matic for approval and, on the same day, it was approved by the Regional Director of Region IV of the Department of Agrarian Reform. Thereafter, Matic caused the titling of the property in the name of Tipon to whom was issued Transfer Certificate of Title No. 50617 and later, had the same transferred to his name under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 53850 dated July 12, 1977, of the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Laguna. [27] A basic principle of statutory construction mandates that general legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject, and generally be so interpreted as to embrace only cases in which the special provisions are not applicable. [28] There is no question that Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1474 is inconsistent with Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844. The former authorizes the sale or transfer of agricultural lands within the Laguna Resettlement Project, while the latter law prohibits the transfer of agricultural lands distributed by the government to farmer-beneficiaries, at least for a limited period. Presidential Decree No. 1474 as a special law should govern lands within the Laguna Resettlement Project, while Republic Act No. 3844 is a law generally applied to agrarian lands.\n\nThe second issue Filinvest raised is whether the DARAB had jurisdiction over a case involving the subject land. Rule II, Section 1, of the DARAB Revised Rules of Procedure provides that the DARAB shall have primary jurisdiction, both original and appellate over:\n(c) Cases involving the annulment or cancellation of orders or decisions of DAR officials other than the Secretary, lease contracts or deeds of sale or their amendments under the administration and disposition of the DAR and LBP; x x x. However, Filinvest argued that under Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1474, the Laguna Resettlement Project was no longer agricultural land but was effectively converted into a commercial, industrial and residential site, and was therefore outside the jurisdiction of the DARAB. Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1474 reads:\nSection 1. The Department of Agrarian Reform, as Administrator of the San Pedro Tunasan Estate, is hereby ordered to convert such estate into a commercial, industrial and residential site and to transfer the same to the National Housing Authority. From the aforecited provision, it is clear that the DAR had lost jurisdiction over government lands located in the Laguna Resettlement Project formerly under its administration which it was ordered to transfer to the National Housing Authority (NHA). More importantly, the DARAB can no longer annul the Deed of Sale between the government and Ricardo Alvarez, or the subsequent transfers, on the ground that Alvarez violated Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844 and the conditions laid down in the Deed of Sale regarding the ten-year restriction on the transfer of the same land. At that time, the transfer between Alvarez and Oliver was made, these aforementioned rules were repealed by the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1474. These rules were no longer applicable to the land in question, as it was no longer under the administration of the DAR nor agrarian in character. The validity of the subsequent transfer of the subject land between Ricardo Alvarez and Mercedes Oliver, or even the later transfer between Mercedes Oliver and Filinvest, was no longer subject to agrarian laws, as the land was already commercial, industrial, or residential in nature at the time of the transfer. Therefore, any proceeding which attacks the validity of the subsequent transfers are within the jurisdiction of regular courts.\n\nClearly, the respondents filed the case before the PARAD, not because the case involved a dispute that would be properly resolved by the PARAD, but because they were already barred from filing the case before the proper forum. The allegations and relief found in the Complaint filed by the respondents before the PARAD are conspicuously similar to those in the Amended Complaint which they had earlier filed before the trial court of Bi\u00f1an. [29] As earlier discussed, the trial court ordered the dismissal of the case for failure to prosecute. When the respondents failed to file a motion for reconsideration, despite due notice, such order became final.\n\nThis Court cannot countenance the party-litigant's recourse to such measures. The foundation principle upon which the doctrine of res judicata rests is that parties should not be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once. When a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it is not reversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate. [30]\n\nThe following requisites must concur in order that a prior judgment may bar a subsequent action: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) it must be a judgment or order on the merits, that is, it was rendered after a consideration of the evidence or stipulations submitted by the parties at the trial of the case; (3) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and (4) there must be, between the first and second actions, identity of parties, of subject matter and of cause of action. [31]\n\nA perusal of the records easily shows that the first, third and fourth requirements have been complied with in this case. The Order rendered by Branch XXIV of the RTC of Bi\u00f1an, dated 17 February 1989, dismissing the case, is clearly final, as it disposed of all the rights and obligations of the parties before it. [32] There was never any question raised on the jurisdiction of Branch XXIV of the RTC to hear and decide the question of whether the sale executed between Ricardo Alvarez and Mercedes Oliver was valid. It is also obvious that the allegations of the respondents in their Amended Complaint filed before the RTC of Bi\u00f1an are substantially identical to the Complaint filed before the PARAD; involved the same subject matter, and raised the same causes of action. [33] Filinvest was named as a party only in the complaint before the PARAD, since it acquired the property from Mercedes Oliver only on 22 December 1989, [34] after the case before the RTC was dismissed on 17 February 1997. Moreover, the fact that its predecessor-in interest, Mercedes Oliver, was a party in the case filed before the RTC of Bi\u00f1an satisfies the requirement on the identity of parties. In the case of Camara v. Court of Appeals , [35] this Court has ruled that, \"[t]here is identity of parties not only where the parties are the same, but also those in privity with them, as between their successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity.\"\n\nThe only contention between the parties was whether the second requirement, that the decision or order must have been based on the merits of the case, was met. In situations contemplated in Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, [36] where a complaint is dismissed for failure of the plaintiff to comply with a lawful order of the court, such dismissal has the effect of an adjudication upon the merits. [37] A dismissal for failure to prosecute has the effect of an adjudication on the merits, and operates as res judicata , particularly when the court did not direct that the dismissal was without prejudice. [38]\n\nHaving complied with the four requisites needed for the doctrine of res judicata to operate, the Order rendered by the RTC of Bi\u00f1an dismissing Civil Case No. B-1941 finally determined the ownership of the subject land, the heirs of the late Ricardo Alvarez, Mercedes Oliver, and her successor-in-interest, Filinvest, as no motion for reconsideration on this Order was filed. Moreover, this would bar any dispute over the subject land from being brought before any judicial forum. Rule 39, Section 47 of the Rules of Court [39] provides that in case of a judgment or final order over a specific thing, rendered by a court having jurisdiction, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing and binding upon the parties and their successors-in-interest.\n\nFurthermore, the allegations of the private respondents of their counsel's negligence cannot be given any credence. In the Affidavit of private respondent Romeo Alvarez, and reiterated in the Comment filed by the private respondents before the Court of Appeals, it was alleged that on 12 December 1986, their counsel, Atty. Rosendo O. Chavez, executed a Notice of Withdrawal, which was not filed before the trial court and did not bear the conformity of the private respondents. [40] Thereafter, Atty. Chavez allegedly stopped attending the hearings before the trial court. As a result thereof, the private respondents were not notified of the 17 February 1989 hearing, when the Order dismissing the case was issued.\n\nRecords clearly show that Atty. Chavez could not have withdrawn from the case on 12 December 1986. As of 14 December 1987, Atty. Chavez presented as his witness, Rosario Param, one of the private respondents. [41] Since he requested for continuance, he was required to bring the witness on the next hearing date. However, seven postponements later, he was unable to bring the witness he presented. [42] On 17 October 1988, Atty. Chavez attended the hearing. He failed to attend the next hearing on 20 January 1989. Nevertheless, he was still at that time the counsel of the private respondents and therefore the notice to him was binding upon the parties. Moreover, the private respondent Rosario Param was perfectly aware that her testimony was far from finished, and that she still needed to appear before the Court. Given the foregoing facts, private respondent's allegations that their counsel was grossly negligent and that he had deceived them is not credible.\n\nEven if the allegations of the private respondents are to be believed, they should have raised them in a Motion for Reconsideration, or a petition to annul the Order of the trial court dismissing the case. While they alleged that they did not receive the Order requiring them to appear on the 17 February 1989 hearing, they never denied receiving the Order of dismissal. As the records stand, the counsel for the respondents received the Order dismissing the case on 28 February 1989, [43] and the respondents never filed a Motion for Reconsideration or even a belated appeal to question the Order dismissing case. Instead, they waited for a full year and filed with the DARAB a case which was under the jurisdiction of the regular courts.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court GRANTS this petition and REVERSES the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 48396, dated 11 November 1998, affirming the Order of the DARAB nullifying the transfer certificate titles issued in the names of Ricardo Alvarez, Mercedes Oliver and Filinvest Land Inc. since the DARAB was without jurisdiction to issue the said Order.

However, I do not agree with the additional pronouncements made by the ponencia that (1) the sale of the subject land by Alvarez to Oliver as well as by Oliver to Filinvest is valid; [1] (2) the instant case is barred by res judicata because of a prior case filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna for recovery of ownership over the same land; and, (3) any subsequent action, if one should be filed, involving title over the subject land is already barred by res judicata . [2]\n\nWith due respect, the ponencia might have overlooked the consequences of its finding that the DARAB was without jurisdiction over the instant case. Since the DARAB was without jurisdiction over the instant case, all the proceedings had as well as orders and decisions issued therein were null and void. As a result, the other issues raised by Filinvest could no longer be resolved because of the finding that the DARAB has no jurisdiction to hear the instant case. The declaration of the ponencia validating the sales of the subject land by Alvarez to Oliver as well as by Oliver to Filinvest is thus inappropriate under the circumstances. All that should be done is to order the dismissal of the instant case.\n\nWhether the filing of a subsequent case is barred by res judicata is an issue that should be resolved if and when such a subsequent case is filed. The rule is well-settled that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution. [3] The instant case is not the proper forum to rule on the existence of res judicata . To emphasize, the DARAB has no jurisdiction hence all proceedings therein are null and void. Consequently, the issue of res judicata raised therein could not be resolved. It follows that any pronouncement thereon by the ponencia is inappropriate.\n\nIndeed, the records of the instant case reveal that a prior action for reconveyance of the subject land was filed by private respondents before the RTC of Bi\u00f1an, Laguna; that the same was dismissed by the trial court for failure to prosecute; and that the order dismissing the RTC case became final and executory for failure of the private respondents to appeal therefrom. But, as previously discussed, the issue of whether the instant case is barred by res judicata because of the filing of a prior RTC case became moot with the finding that the DARAB, to begin with, has no jurisdiction over the instant case.\n\nNevertheless, the ponencia went on to rule on the issue of res judicata and took it a step further by declaring that the dismissal of the RTC case \"would bar any dispute over the subject land from being brought before any judicial forum.\" [4] With due respect, whether Filinvest can validly raise the defense of res judicata in a future, subsequent case involving title over the subject land is a matter of defense which this Court cannot resolve in the instant case without violating the rule that states that the power of adjudication of courts is limited to actual controversies. Such a declaration is premature to say the least. The other party must be allowed to refute the existence of the elements of res judicata in the proper forum at the proper time when it is raised as an issue. But as it is, such subsequent case has yet to be filed. Definitely, the instant case is not the \"subsequent case\" as the DARAB has no jurisdiction to begin with.\n\nIn fine, the issue of whether the sale of the subject land by Alvarez to Oliver and by Oliver to Filinvest is valid as well as whether a future, subsequent case is barred by res judicata cannot be resolved in the instant case. The only valid and binding ruling in the instant case should be one for dismissal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the instant complaint should be DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n[1] The ponencia stated thus:\nIn the present case, the government, through the DAR had already issued an Order of Award and a Deed of Sale in favor if Ricardo Alvarez covering a parcel of land located within the Laguna Resettlement Project, when Presidential Decree No. 1474 was enacted on 11 June 1978. In 1979, Alvarez, with the consent of his spouse, Rosario Param, transferred the same parcel of land to Mercedes Oliver. Such transfer was clearly sanctioned. As earlier adverted to, Section 2 of presidential Decree No. 1474 revoked the application of Section 62 of Republic Act No. 3844 and the condition prohibiting the transfer of the land contained in the Deed of Sale executed by the DAR in favor of Alvarez, in so far as land within the Laguna Resettlement Project was concerned. Since the transfer made by Ricardo Alvarez to Mercedes Oliver was valid, the subsequent transfer made by Mercedes Oliver to Filinvest is also valid.

NO. 138939, December 06, 2006 ]\n\nMR. AND MRS. ALEJANDRO PANG-ODEN, PETITIONERS, VS. ISABEL LEONEN, CATALINA G. LEONEN, CAYETANO LEONEN, MANUEL LEONEN, ANGEL LEONEN, MARIA LEONEN, HERMINIA LEONEN, TERESITA L. ACOSTA, AND FRANCISCO LEONEN, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N\nMR. AND MRS. ALEJANDRO PANG-ODEN, PETITIONERS, VS. ISABEL LEONEN, CATALINA G. LEONEN, CAYETANO LEONEN, MANUEL LEONEN, ANGEL LEONEN, MARIA LEONEN, HERMINIA LEONEN, TERESITA L. ACOSTA, AND FRANCISCO LEONEN, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nIn this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitioner-spouses Alejandro Pang-oden and Saturnina Pang-oden assail and seek to set aside the decision [1] dated June 8, 1998 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 54494 , as reiterated in its Resolution [2] of January 7, 1999, denying the petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe assailed decision affirmed an earlier decision [3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Balaoan, La Union, Branch 34, in Civil Case No 440, an action for Recovery of Possession Based on Ownership , thereat commenced by the herein respondents against the petitioners.\n\nBasically, the case involves a boundary dispute between petitioners and respondents. Both claim ownership of a strip of land consisting of 1,336.5 square meters.\n\nThe facts:\n\nPetitioners and respondents are the owners of two (2) adjoining parcels of land located at Sudipen, La Union. Petitioners' land is at the eastern portion while that of the respondents is at the western side. The two properties have a common boundary: a creek which ran from south to north, such that petitioners' property was bounded by said creek on the west, while that of respondents was bounded by the same creek on the east.\n\nDue to constant heavy rains and flood, water from the creek overflowed and destroyed the irrigation canal located at the north of the property in dispute. In order to minimize the damage to the irrigation canal, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) diverted the course of the creek so rain water will not go directly to the irrigation canal. As a result, the course of the creek which originally ran from south to north and which used to separate the respective properties of the parties was instead diverted to run from south to northwest, passing through the middle portion of the respondents' property and resulting to the formation of a new creek. Consequently, the NIA asked the permission of Manuel Leonen, one of the herein respondents, to allow it to use the new creek as an irrigation canal. Manuel Leonen consented. The portion segregated by the new creek, consisting of 1,336.5 square meters, is the strip of land subject of this controversy.\n\nAccording to the respondents, the property in question forms part of a bigger parcel of land with an area of 5,370 square meters declared in the name of their father and predecessor-in-interest, Dionisio Leonen, under Tax Declaration No. 6473. For more than 50 years, they have been in quiet, peaceful, adverse and uninterrupted possession of the disputed property. Sometime in 1976, however, Manuel Leonen saw the carabao of petitioner Alejandro Pang-oden devouring the Leonens' sugar cane crops planted on the property in question. It was then that Manuel Leonen discovered that petitioners had encroached on the 1,336.5-square meter portion of their property and had in fact occupied the same. Respondents brought the matter before the local barangay authorities but Alejandro Pang-oden refused to surrender possession of said portion claiming that he is the lawful owner thereof.\n\nOn September 25, 1992, after repeated demands to vacate the subject strip of land remained unheeded, the respondents filed a complaint for Recovery of Possession Based on Ownership against the spouses Alejandro and Saturnina Pang-oden before the RTC of Balaoan, La Union, thereat docketed as Civil Case No. 440.\n\nIn their Answer with Counterclaim, the spouses Alejandro and Saturnina Pang-oden claimed that the 1,336.5-square meter strip of land in question was part of a bigger property with an area of 12,674-square meters originally owned by Alejandro's mother, Sotera Apusen, under Tax Declaration No. 4506. They also averred that it was around the year 1950 when Manuel Leonen started cultivating the subject strip of land and planted crops thereon, but only upon the mere tolerance of Alejandro's mother.\n\nOn November 23, 1995, the RTC rendered judgment for the respondents as plaintiffs thereat, adjudging the latter to be the lawful and exclusive owners of the property in question, and ordering the spouses Pang-oden to vacate the same and pay the respondents the amount of P1,000.00 representing the yearly harvest of the land; P10,000.00 as attorney's fees; P10,000.00 as moral damages; and P5,000.00 as litigation expenses.\n\nFrom the adverse decision of the trial court, the spouses went on appeal to the CA in CA G.R. CV No. 54494 . On June 8, 1998, the CA came out with its herein challenged decision affirming that of the trial court, minus the award of P1,000.00 for the yearly harvest of the land, thus:\nWHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the order to pay xxx the amount of P1,000.00 representing the yearly harvest of the land from 1989 up to the time ownership and possession is finally restored is SET ASIDE.\n\nCosts against defendants-appellants.\n\nSO ORDERED. Partly says the CA in its decision:\nBased on the evidence submitted by plaintiffs-appellees [herein respondents], it was established that there was indeed an old creek that used to separate the properties of plaintiffs-appellees and the defendants-appellants [herein petitioners] which originally ran from south to north. It has likewise been established by overwhelming evidence that a new creek was later created that now runs from south to northwest and thus cuts through plaintiffs-appellees' property.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThese witnesses are, as aptly noted by the trial court, \"disinterested witnesses testifying to a fact of public knowledge that there was an original creek in the eastern boundary of the property of Dionisio Leonen.\" Their testimonies were properly found to be credible as they were consistent with the cadastral survey and the survey plan submitted by plaintiffs-appellees.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nxxx. And by the creation of the new creek that cuts through the property of plaintiffs-appellees, defendants-appellants cannot claim ownership of the segregated portion (subject of this case) because as far as their property is concerned, the parcel of land left by Sotera Apusen remains bounded on the west by the old creek and cannot extend to the portion segregated by the new creek. (Words in brackets added). [4] Their motion for reconsideration having been denied by the appellate court in its Resolution of January 7, 1999, the spouses Pang-oden are now with this Court via the instant recourse, contending that the CA gravely erred:\nI\n\nXXX IN AWARDING THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IN SUIT (1,336.5 SQ. M. IN AREA) LOCATED WITHIN SITIO PANGASAAN, NAMALTUGAN, SUDIPEN, LA UNION, TO RESPONDENTS WHEN THEIR PROPERTY IS LOCATED AT SITIO BIMMODET, NAMALTUGAN, SUDIPEN LA UNION.\n\nII\n\nXXX IN AFFIRMING THE AWARDS OF P10,000.00 AS ATTORNEY'S FEES, P10,000.00 AS MORAL DAMAGES AND P5,000.00 AS LITIGATION EXPENSES TO RESPONDENTS.\n\nIII\n\nXXX IN NOT REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT SINCE RESPONDENTS' COMPLAINT LACKS THE REQUIRED QUANTUM OF PROOF AND THE TESTIMONY OF THEIR WITNESSES ARE NOT IN HARMONY WITH THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE LOCALITY. [5]\n\nWe DENY . In the main, the only issue to be resolved is: who, as between the petitioners and the respondents, own the strip of land subject of the suit.\n\nPetitioners contend that no new creek was created and that the present creek is the same creek which bounds their property on the west, thus making them the owners of the property in question. Likewise, the petitioners argue that both the trial and appellate courts should have relied on the boundaries and exact location of the subject property. Finally, they fault the CA for giving credence to the conflicting testimonies of the respondents' witnesses.\n\nIn assailing the appellate court's decision, petitioners impute errors which basically involve questions of fact and the appreciation of evidence by the two courts below. This case furnishes another occasion for us to reiterate the settled principle that this Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review under Rule 45 is limited to reviewing and correcting only errors of law, not of fact, the only power of the Court being to determine if the legal conclusions drawn from the findings of fact are correct. [6] Absent any showing that the findings complained of are totally devoid of support from the evidence on record, or that the judgment itself is based on misapprehension of facts, such findings must stand. The Court is not expected or required to examine or refute the oral and documentary evidence submitted by the parties. [7] The Court finds no reason to depart from this settled rule, it appearing that the findings of fact by the courts a quo are fully substantiated by the evidence extant on record. Likewise, the Court has consistently ruled that the findings of fact by the CA, especially if such findings, as here, are affirmatory of those of the trial court, will not be disturbed on appeal. [8]\n\nThe CA and the trial court relied on the testimonies of two (2) disinterested witnesses: Gregorio Libao, a retired employee of the NIA, and Anacleto Dicta-an, a resident of Sudipen, La Union. Both testified as to the existence of an old creek which served as the common boundary of the respective properties of the parties, and of the subsequent diversion of the creek to its present position which now cuts through the middle portion of the respondents' property. Petitioners insist, however, that their testimonies are replete with inconsistencies and contradictions which render said testimonies unworthy of belief. The Court disagrees. The two courts below both found their testimonies credible. Matters of credibility of witnesses are best addressed to the sound judgment of the trial court, and this Court generally defers to the trial court's assessment because it has the singular opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses and their manner of testifying. [9] Besides, as correctly pointed out by the CA, the inconsistencies cited by the petitioners refer to minor and collateral matters which do not affect the credibility of said witnesses.\n\nFor sure, the witnesses' testimonies were amply supported by the report and sketch plan prepared by the court-appointed commissioner, which revealed the existence of an old creek running from south to north, and the creation of a new creek from south to northwest. The same sketch plan showed that the location of the house of Sotera Apusen, mother of petitioner Alejandro Pang-oden, was bounded on the west by the old creek, which creek bounds the lot of Dionisio Leonen on the east. This bolsters the fact that there was indeed an old creek which used to separate the respective properties of the herein parties.\n\nWorth mentioning is the provision of Article 434 of the Civil Code which ordains that \"in an action to recover, the property must be identified, and the plaintiff must rely on the strength of his title and not on the weakness of the defendant's claim.\" Hence, in order that an action for the recovery of property may prosper, it is indispensable that the party who prosecutes it must fully prove, not only his ownership of the thing claimed, but also the identity of the same. [10] As we see it, the evidence presented in this case showed that the property subject of the dispute rightfully belongs to the respondents, as it was established that the same is part of the parcel of land declared under the name of respondents' predecessor-in-interest, Dionisio Leonen. Indeed, the verification survey of the contested property conducted by Juvenal Quitoriano, a geodetic engineer, revealed that it was in the name of Dionisio Leonen. Too, the identity of the disputed strip of land has been proven in a conclusive manner as its location corresponds with those given by the witnesses and the record of the ocular inspection. The cadastral survey of the property clearly identifies and delineates the extent of the subject land. As the petitioners failed to substantiate their claim that the present creek is still the same creek which bounds their property on the west, the respondents have the right to recover possession of the disputed strip of land.\n\nIn sum, the evidence on record clearly establish that there used to be an old creek originally running from south to north and separating the property of the petitioners from that of the respondents. Then, due to expediency and necessity of protecting the irrigation canal in the area, the course of that creek was subsequently diverted to run from south to northwest, cutting through the property of the respondents. Hence, the portion segregated (the subject property) from respondents' land as a result of such diversion continues to be their property and they shall retain ownership of the same.\n\nWe are, however, with the petitioners in their challenge as regards the trial court's award of moral damages, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, as affirmed by the CA. As it is, the trial court erred in this respect, as it did not disclose in the body of its decision the factual basis for such awards. Whenever such awards are made, the court must explicitly state in the body of its decision, and not merely in its dispositive portion, the legal reason for the award. [11] Here, the trial court made the award only in the dispositive portion of its decision without stating the basis therefor in the body thereof. The power of courts to grant damages and attorney's fees demands factual, legal and equitable justification; its basis cannot be left to speculation or conjecture. [12]\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED and the assailed CA decision dated June 8, 1998 is AFFIRMED , with the MODIFICATION that the award of moral damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses is DELETED .\n\nCosts against the petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, and Azcuna, concur.\nCorona, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Salome A.

      "title": "The Court gave due course to the petition and required the parties to file their respective memoranda.Atty. Briones (hereinafter referred to as complainant) filed his \"Memorandum with Administrative Complaint for Disbarment against Atty. Jacinto Jimenez, Counsel for Respondents\",[9] for violation of Rule 19.01 and Rule 12.08 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Revised Circular No. 28-91 on forum shopping.Complainant claims that Atty. Jimenez (hereinafter referred to as respondent) and the Heirs engaged again in forum shopping when respondent, as counsel for the Heirs, filed a criminal complaint and executed an affidavit against complainant for resisting and seriously disobeying the RTC Order dated April 3, 2002 which directed complainant to deliver the residue of the estate to the Heirs in proportion to their shares, punishable under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code.Complainant further claims that respondent violated Rules 19.01 and 12.08 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, to wit:Rule 19.01 \u2014 A lawyer shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client and shall not present, participate in presenting or threaten to present unfounded criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in any case of proceeding.Rule 12.08 \u2014 A lawyer shall avoid testifying in behalf of his client, except:(a) on formal matters, such as the mailing, authentication or custody of an instrument, and the like; orb) on substantial matters, in cases where his testimony is essential to the ends of justice, in which event he must, during his testimony, entrust the trial of the case to another counsel.by filing the unfounded criminal complaint against him to obtain an improper advantage in Special Proceedings No. 99-92870 before the RTC, Branch 46, and coerce complainant to deliver to the Heirs the residue of the estate of the late Luz J. Henson without any writ of execution or any pronouncement from the RTC as to the finality of the Order dated April 3, 2002;[10] and in executing an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.The Court in its Resolution dated January 24, 2005, in G.R. No. 159130, resolved to docket the complaint against Atty. Jimenez as a regular administrative complaint; referred said Complaint to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC); and required Atty. Jimenez to comment.[11]Respondent filed his Comment on April 6, 2005. He contends that when he assisted the Heirs in filing a criminal case against complainant, he was merely fulfilling his legal duty to take the necessary steps to protect the interests of his clients; that it cannot serve as basis for filing an administrative case against him.[12] Respondent further cites Santiago v. Rafanan[13] where the Court absolved the respondent lawyer from administrative liability in submitting an affidavit in a preliminary investigation in defense of his clients.On January 31, 2007, the OBC submitted its Report and Recommendation recommending that the administrative complaint against Atty. Jimenez be dismissed for lack of merit.[14]The Court agrees with the OBC that respondent is not guilty of forum shopping. Records show that respondent, as counsel for the heirs of the late Luz J. Henson, filed a special civil action docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 70349 assailing the Order of March 12, 2002 appointing the accounting firm of Alba, Romeo and Co. as auditor; and, a regular appeal docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 71488 assailing the Order of April 3, 2002, insofar as it directed the payment of commission to complainant. It is evident that there is identity of parties but different causes of action and reliefs sought. Hence, respondent is not guilty of forum shopping.[15] The Court likewise finds no fault on the part of respondent in executing an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint as held in the Santiago case.However, there is sufficient ground in support of complainant's claim that respondent violated Rule 19.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Records reveal that before respondent assisted the Heirs in filing the criminal complaint against herein complainant, he sent demand letters to the latter to comply with the Order of Judge Tipon to deliver the residue of the estate to the heirs of the late Luz J. Henson. Considering that complainant did not reply to the demand letters, respondent opted to file said criminal complaint in behalf of his clients for refusal to obey the lawful order of the court.The Order referred to is the third part of the assailed Order dated April 3, 2002 which directs complainant to deliver the residue to the Heirs in proportion to their shares. As aptly pointed out by complainant, respondent should have first filed the proper motion with the RTC for execution of the third part of said Order instead of immediately resorting to the filing of criminal complaint against him. A mere perusal of the rest of the Order dated April 3, 2002 readily discloses that the approval of the report of complainant as Special Administrator was suspended prior to the audit of the administration of complainant. Consequently, the RTC would still have to determine and define the residue referred to in the subject Order. The filing of the criminal complaint was evidently premature.Respondent claims that he acted in good faith and in fact, did not violate Rule 19.01 because he assisted the Heirs in filing the criminal complaint against herein complainant after the latter ignored the demand letters sent to him; and that a lawyer owes his client the exercise of utmost prudence and capability. The Court is not convinced. Fair play demands that respondent should have filed the proper motion with the RTC to attain his goal of having the residue of the estate delivered to his clients and not subject complainant to a premature criminal prosecution.As held in Suzuki v. Tiamson:[16]Canon 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility enjoins a lawyer to represent his client with zeal. However, the same Canon provides that a lawyer's performance of his duties towards his client must be within the bounds of the law. Rule 19.01 of the same Canon requires, among others, that a lawyer shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client. Canon 15, Rule 15.07 also obliges lawyers to impress upon their clients compliance with the laws and the principle of fairness. To permit lawyers to resort to unscrupulous practices for the protection of the supposed rights of their clients is to defeat one of the purposes of the state \u2014 the administration of justice. While lawyers owe their entire devotion to the interest of their clients and zeal in the defense of their client's right, they should not forget that they are, first and foremost, officers of the court, bound to exert every effort to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.[17]Although respondent failed to live up to this expectation, there is no evidence that he acted with malice or bad faith. Consequently, it is but fit to reprimand respondent for his act of unfair dealing with complainant. It must be stressed that disbarment is the most severe form of disciplinary sanction, and, as such, the power to disbar must always be exercised with great caution for only the most imperative reasons and in clear cases of misconduct affecting the standing and moral character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and a member of the bar. Accordingly, disbarment should not be decreed where any punishment less severe \u2014 such as reprimand, suspension, or fine \u2014 would accomplish the end desired.[18]WHEREFORE, Atty. Jacinto D. Jimenez is found GUILTY of and REPRIMANDED for violation of Rule 19.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., Chico-Nazario, and Nachura, JJ., concur.

JIMENEZ,\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nThe root of herein administrative complaint for Disbarment [1] dated August 12, 2004 filed by Atty. George S. Briones charging Atty. Jacinto D. Jimenez with violation of Revised Circular No. 28-91 on forum-shopping and Rule 19.01 and Rule 12.08 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, is the April 3, 2002 Order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila in SP Proc. No. 99-92870, entitled, \"In the Matter of the Petition for the Allowance of the Will of Luz J. Henson\", to wit:\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the court hereby:\nReiterates its designation of the accounting firm of Messrs. Alba, Romeo & Co. to immediately conduct an audit of the administration by Atty. George S. Briones of the estate of the late Luz J. Henson, the expenses of which shall be charged against the estate.\n\nSuspends the approval of the report of the special administrator except the payment of his commission which is hereby fixed at 1.8% of the value of the estate.\n\nDirects the special administrator to deliver the residue to the heirs in proportion to their shares. From the share of Lilia J. Henson-Cruz, there shall be deducted the advances made to her.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nComplainant Atty. Briones is the Special Administrator of the Estate of Luz J. Henson. Respondent Atty. Jacinto D. Jimenez is the counsel for the Heirs of the late Luz J. Henson (Heirs).\n\nOn April 9, 2002, Atty. Jimenez filed with the RTC a notice of appeal from the Order dated April 3, 2002, questioning the payment of commission to Atty. Briones. [2]\n\nOn April 29, 2002, Atty. Jimenez filed with the Court of Appeals (CA) a Petition for Certiorari , Prohibition and Mandamus, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 70349 assailing the Order dated March 12, 2002, appointing the firm of Alba, Romeo & Co. to conduct an audit at the expense of the late Luz J. Henson, as well as the Order dated April 3, 2002, insofar as it denied their motion for recommendation. [3]\n\nOn July 26, 2002, Atty. Jimenez filed with the CA a Petition for Mandamus , docketed as CA-G.R. No. 71844, [4] alleging that the respondent Judge therein unlawfully refused to comply with his ministerial duty to approve their appeal which was perfected on time. [5]\n\nAtty. Briones, in his Comment, contends that the heirs of the late Luz J. Henson, represented by Atty. Jimenez, are guilty of forum shopping for which reason, the petition should be dismissed. [6]\n\nOn February 11, 2003, the CA without touching on the forum shopping issue, granted the petition and ordered the respondent Judge to give due course to the appeal taken by Atty. Jimenez from the Order dated April 3, 2002, insofar as it directed the payment of commission to Atty. Briones. [7]\n\nAtty. Briones then filed with this Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, docketed as G.R. No. 159130, praying for the dismissal of the appeal from the Order dated April 3, 2002, insofar as it ordered the payment of commission to him, as the Special Administrator of the estate of the deceased Luz J. Henson. [8]\n\nThe Court gave due course to the petition and required the parties to file their respective memoranda.\n\nAtty. Briones (hereinafter referred to as complainant) filed his \"Memorandum with Administrative Complaint for Disbarment against Atty. Jacinto Jimenez, Counsel for Respondents\", [9] for violation of Rule 19.01 and Rule 12.08 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Revised Circular No. 28-91 on forum shopping.\n\nComplainant claims that Atty. Jimenez (hereinafter referred to as respondent) and the Heirs engaged again in forum shopping when respondent, as counsel for the Heirs, filed a criminal complaint and executed an affidavit against complainant for resisting and seriously disobeying the RTC Order dated April 3, 2002 which directed complainant to deliver the residue of the estate to the Heirs in proportion to their shares, punishable under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nComplainant further claims that respondent violated Rules 19.01 and 12.08 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, to wit:\nRule 19.01 \u2014 A lawyer shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client and shall not present, participate in presenting or threaten to present unfounded criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in any case of proceeding.\n\nRule 12.08 \u2014 A lawyer shall avoid testifying in behalf of his client, except:\n\n(a) on formal matters, such as the mailing, authentication or custody of an instrument, and the like; or\n\nb) on substantial matters, in cases where his testimony is essential to the ends of justice, in which event he must, during his testimony, entrust the trial of the case to another counsel.\nby filing the unfounded criminal complaint against him to obtain an improper advantage in Special Proceedings No. 99-92870 before the RTC, Branch 46, and coerce complainant to deliver to the Heirs the residue of the estate of the late Luz J. Henson without any writ of execution or any pronouncement from the RTC as to the finality of the Order dated April 3, 2002; [10] and in executing an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.\n\nThe Court in its Resolution dated January 24, 2005, in G.R. No. 159130, resolved to docket the complaint against Atty. Jimenez as a regular administrative complaint; referred said Complaint to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC); and required Atty. Jimenez to comment. [11]\n\nRespondent filed his Comment on April 6, 2005. He contends that when he assisted the Heirs in filing a criminal case against complainant, he was merely fulfilling his legal duty to take the necessary steps to protect the interests of his clients; that it cannot serve as basis for filing an administrative case against him. [12] Respondent further cites Santiago v. Rafanan [13] where the Court absolved the respondent lawyer from administrative liability in submitting an affidavit in a preliminary investigation in defense of his clients.\n\nOn January 31, 2007, the OBC submitted its Report and Recommendation recommending that the administrative complaint against Atty. Jimenez be dismissed for lack of merit. [14]\n\nThe Court agrees with the OBC that respondent is not guilty of forum shopping. Records show that respondent, as counsel for the heirs of the late Luz J. Henson, filed a special civil action docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 70349 assailing the Order of March 12, 2002 appointing the accounting firm of Alba, Romeo and Co. as auditor; and, a regular appeal docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 71488 assailing the Order of April 3, 2002, insofar as it directed the payment of commission to complainant. It is evident that there is identity of parties but different causes of action and reliefs sought . Hence, respondent is not guilty of forum shopping. [15] The Court likewise finds no fault on the part of respondent in executing an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint as held in the Santiago case.\n\nHowever, there is sufficient ground in support of complainant's claim that respondent violated Rule 19.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Records reveal that before respondent assisted the Heirs in filing the criminal complaint against herein complainant, he sent demand letters to the latter to comply with the Order of Judge Tipon to deliver the residue of the estate to the heirs of the late Luz J. Henson. Considering that complainant did not reply to the demand letters, respondent opted to file said criminal complaint in behalf of his clients for refusal to obey the lawful order of the court.\n\nThe Order referred to is the third part of the assailed Order dated April 3, 2002 which directs complainant to deliver the residue to the Heirs in proportion to their shares. As aptly pointed out by complainant, respondent should have first filed the proper motion with the RTC for execution of the third part of said Order instead of immediately resorting to the filing of criminal complaint against him. A mere perusal of the rest of the Order dated April 3, 2002 readily discloses that the approval of the report of complainant as Special Administrator was suspended prior to the audit of the administration of complainant. Consequently, the RTC would still have to determine and define the residue referred to in the subject Order. The filing of the criminal complaint was evidently premature.\n\nRespondent claims that he acted in good faith and in fact, did not violate Rule 19.01 because he assisted the Heirs in filing the criminal complaint against herein complainant after the latter ignored the demand letters sent to him; and that a lawyer owes his client the exercise of utmost prudence and capability. The Court is not convinced. Fair play demands that respondent should have filed the proper motion with the RTC to attain his goal of having the residue of the estate delivered to his clients and not subject complainant to a premature criminal prosecution.\n\nAs held in Suzuki v. Tiamson : [16]\nCanon 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility enjoins a lawyer to represent his client with zeal. However, the same Canon provides that a lawyer's performance of his duties towards his client must be within the bounds of the law. Rule 19.01 of the same Canon requires, among others, that a lawyer shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client. Canon 15, Rule 15.07 also obliges lawyers to impress upon their clients compliance with the laws and the principle of fairness. To permit lawyers to resort to unscrupulous practices for the protection of the supposed rights of their clients is to defeat one of the purposes of the state \u2014 the administration of justice. While lawyers owe their entire devotion to the interest of their clients and zeal in the defense of their client's right, they should not forget that they are, first and foremost, officers of the court, bound to exert every effort to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. [17]\nAlthough respondent failed to live up to this expectation, there is no evidence that he acted with malice or bad faith. Consequently, it is but fit to reprimand respondent for his act of unfair dealing with complainant. It must be stressed that disbarment is the most severe form of disciplinary sanction, and, as such, the power to disbar must always be exercised with great caution for only the most imperative reasons and in clear cases of misconduct affecting the standing and moral character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and a member of the bar. Accordingly, disbarment should not be decreed where any punishment less severe \u2014 such as reprimand, suspension, or fine \u2014 would accomplish the end desired. [18]\n\nWHEREFORE , Atty. Jacinto D. Jimenez is found GUILTY of and REPRIMANDED for violation of Rule 19.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Callejo, Sr., Chico-Nazario, and Nachura, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 2-33.\n\n[2] Id. at 41.\n\n[3] Id.\n\n[4] Entitled, \"Lilia J.

BENIGNO DE LA VEGA, ANGELA TUASON STALEY AND ANTONIO PEREZ Y TUASON,RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nAssailed in this petition for review is the February 3, 2005 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 79957, which affirmed the March 21, 2003 Order [2] of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 264, granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by respondents in Civil Case No. 62269.\u00a0 Likewise questioned is the appellate court's July 6, 2005 Resolution [3] which denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe undisputed facts show that on August 3, 1992, respondents filed a complaint\u00a0 for quieting of title and for declaration of nullity of Free Patent No. 495269, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 711 and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 186516, against the heirs of Macario Mencias (defendant heirs), namely, Aquilina Mencias, Aurora M. Gabat, Merlyn M. Cadete, Myrna M. Quirante; and the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Director of the Land Management Bureau and the Register of Deeds of Marikina.\u00a0 The complaint was later amended to implead herein petitioner purchasers of the disputed lot and to nullify TCT No. 272191 issued in their name.\n\nThe Amended Complaint averred that respondents are the co-owners of a 159,576 square meter parcel of land located in Marikina, Rizal, Metro Manila and covered by TCT No. 257152, issued on June 20, 1969.\u00a0 Said title was a transfer from TCT No. 22395 in the name of J. Antonio Araneta as trustee of the children of Angela I. Tuason.\u00a0 Among the lots covered by TCT No. 257152 is the controverted Lot 89 containing an area of 54,197 square meters. [4]\n\nSometime in April 1992, respondents learned that the defendant heirs are causing the ejectment of the occupants of a 29,945 square meter portion of Lot 89; and that Macario Mencias was able to obtain Free Patent No. 495269 on July 31, 1971, and OCT No. 711 on August 11, 1971, over said portion.\u00a0 Upon Macario's death, OCT No. 711 was canceled and TCT No. 186516 was issued to the defendant heirs on July 5, 1990. [5] By virtue of a Deed of Sale inscribed on November 14, 1994, TCT No. 186516 was further cancelled and TCT No. 271604 was issued on the same date in favor of New Atlantis Real Estate & Development, Inc., (Corporation) represented by its President, Victor C. Salvador, Jr.\u00a0 The questioned lot was thereafter sold by the Corporation to petitioners.\u00a0 TCT No. 271604 was thus cancelled and in lieu thereof, TCT No. 272191 was issued to petitioners on November 17, 1994. [6]\n\nRespondents contended that Macario's OCT No. 711 and its derivative titles-TCT No. 186516, in the name of defendant heirs and petitioners' TCT NO. 272191, are void because the area they cover is entirely within their (respondents) land, specifically, Lot 89, as shown by the notation in the said titles, i.e., \"This survey is covered by F.P.A. No. (III-1) 4496; and \"This survey is entirely inside No. 89, II-4755.\" [7] Respondents further averred that since the controverted lot is already a private land, the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, had no jurisdiction to approve Macario's application and to issue Free Patent No. 495269.\u00a0 The pendency of this action was allegedly inscribed in the defendant heirs' title (TCT No. 186516) on August 4, 1992 and carried over to the petitioners' TCT No. 272191. [8]\n\nIn their Answer, [9] the defendant heirs contended that Lot 89 was never part of respondents' TCT No. 257152 which originated from OCT No. 730 .\u00a0 Respondents' own exhibits, i.e., the documents purportedly issued by the Bureau of Lands (Exhibits \"E\" and \"F\"), show that Lot 89 was covered by OCT No. 734 and not OCT No. 730.\u00a0 Defendant heirs further stated that respondents' TCT No. 257152 was issued in lieu of TCT No. 22395 which is a mere reconstitution of TCT No. 45046.\u00a0 Upon verification with the Register of Deeds of Rizal, TCT No. 45046, covers a different parcel of land situated in San Juan, Rizal, and measuring about 356 square meters only.\u00a0 The defendant heirs also raised the defenses of laches and prescription.\n\nOn the other hand, petitioners asserted, inter alia , that they are purchasers in good faith and for value and that they have no knowledge of any defect in the title of the Corporation from whom they purchased the controverted lot.\u00a0 The notice of lis pendens alleged to have been inscribed in TCT No. 186516 on August 4, 1992 does not appear in the Corporation's title, TCT No. 271604 nor in their title, TCT No. 272191.\u00a0 Absent said notice, petitioners claim that they cannot be charged with knowledge of any defect in the Corporation's title.\u00a0 Neither does the note \"This survey is covered by F.P.A. No. (III-1) 4496;\" and \"This survey is entirely inside No. 89, II-4755,\" serve as sufficient warning to third persons because said notes do not indicate that the property is covered by another title. [10]\n\nFor failure to file their Answer, defendant Aurora M. Gabat, [11] public defendants Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Director of Land Management Bureau and the Register of Deeds of Marikina, [12] were declared in default.\n\nOn March 4, 2003, respondents filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings which was granted by the trial court.\u00a0 It was held that the disputed lot is within Lot 89 covered by respondents' TCT No. 257152, issued on June 20, 1969.\u00a0\u00a0 Said lot therefore became a private land long before the Free Patent was issued to Macario on July 31, 1971.\u00a0 Hence, the titles derived or issued on the basis of said Free Patent are void because Public Land Act applies only to public lands and not private lands.\u00a0 On the theory that the spring cannot rise higher than its source, the trial court concluded that petitioners cannot be purchasers in good faith considering that their title was derived from Macario who acquired the property by virtue of a void title.\u00a0 It further ruled that petitioners' defense of good faith must fail because they were forewarned of the notice indicating that the questioned lot is inside Lot 89.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the March 21, 2003 order, reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, Plaintiffs' [respondents herein] Motion is hereby Granted and judgment rendered as follows:\nPlaintiffs' Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 257152 is declared valid and superior to defendants' [petitioners] TCT No. 272191; Free Patent No. 495269 issued by then Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources to Macario Mencias on July 21, 1971 is declared null and void; Original Certificate of Title\u00a0 (OCT) No. 711, Transfer Certificate of\u00a0 Title (TCT) No. 271604/T-1358 and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 272191, TCT No. 186516 and TCT No. 272191, all derivatives [sic] title of Free Patent 495269 issued by Registry of Deeds of Marikina, are also declared null and void; The Bureau of Lands and Land Registration Administration are directed to enter into their technical files the findings in this order; The Registry of Deeds of Marikina is directed to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) NO. 272191 in the names of Edward and Edwin Roco Tan.\nSO ORDERED. [13]\nPetitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the assailed order of the trial court.\u00a0 They filed a motion for reconsideration but was denied in a resolution dated July 6, 2005.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nThe sole issue for resolution is whether a judgment on the pleadings is proper in the instant case.\n\nSection 1. Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, states:\nSECTION 1 . Judgment on the pleadings . \u2014 Where an answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading, the court may, on motion of that party, direct judgment on such pleading. x x x.\nWhere a motion for judgment on the pleadings is filed, the essential question is whether there are issues generated by the pleadings.\u00a0\u00a0 In a proper case for judgment on the pleadings, there is no ostensible issue at all because of the failure of the defending party's answer to raise an issue. [14] The answer would fail to tender an issue, of course, if it does not deny the material allegations in the complaint or admits said material allegations of the adverse party's pleadings by confessing the truthfulness thereof and/or omitting to deal with them at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, if an answer does in fact specifically deny the material averments of the complaint and/or asserts affirmative defenses (allegations of new matter which, while admitting the material allegations of the complaint expressly or impliedly, would nevertheless prevent or bar recovery by the plaintiff), a judgment on the pleadings would naturally be improper. [15]\n\nIn this case, we find that the trial court erred in rendering judgment on the pleadings because the pleadings filed by the parties generated ostensible issues that necessitate the presentation of evidence.\u00a0 Respondents' action for declaration of nullity of Free Patent No. 495269 and the titles derived therefrom is based on their claim that the lot titled in the name of petitioners, is a portion of a bigger tract of land previously titled in the name of their (respondents) predecessors-in-interest.\u00a0 The documents presented in support thereof were the photocopy of respondents' TCT No. 257152 which shows that the land it covers, including lot 89, originated from OCT No. 730; and photocopies of the documents alleged to have been issued by the Bureau of Lands and confirming that the disputed lot is a portion of respondents' Lot 89.\u00a0 Pertinent portions of the Amended Complaint, state:\n5. Sometime in early April, 1992, plaintiff de la Vega was informed by one of the occupants of the above-described lot No. 89 that the heirs of Macario Mencias, the defendants herein, were causing the ejectment of said occupants and claiming to be the owners of an area of 29,945 sq. ms. (sic) which is within, or part of, Lot No. 89 covered by plaintiffs' T.C.T. No. 257152.\u00a0 It was only then that the plaintiffs heard of Macario Mencias and of his encroaching into plaintiffs' Lot 89.\n\n6. The plaintiffs later learned that, unknown to them, Macario Mencias had applied with the then Bureau of Lands for, and obtained on 31 July 1971, Free Patent No. 495269 which was granted under the signature of the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and covering an area of 29,945 sq. ms. (sic) as described in Plan F (III-1) 4496-D.\u00a0 On 11 August 1971, Original Certificate of Title No. 711 (Rizal) was issued to him based on the said Free Patent, and upon his death, said OCT No. 711 was cancelled and transferred to his heirs, the defendants herein, to whom T.C.T. No. 186516 (Marikina) was issued on 5 July 1990.\u00a0 The plaintiffs were never notified of said application of Mencias for free patent nor of the issuance of Free Patent No. 495269 and OCT No. 711 to him and T.C.T. No. 186515 to his heirs, the defendants herein. Photocopies of OCT No. 711, which incorporated Free Patent No. 495269, and T.C.T. No. 186516 are hereto appended as Annexes \"B\" and \"C\", respectively.\n\nx x x x\n\n8. A letter dated 29 October 1971 of Mr. Amando A. Salvador as Chief of the Survey Division of the then Bureau of Lands and addressed to Macario Mencias, 1st Indorsement, dated 15 February 1974, signed by Mr. Daniel C. Florida as Acting Chief of the Legal Division of the Bureau of Lands, a report dated 17 December 1976 by Mr. Jose B. Isidro as Hearing Officer addressed to the Director of Lands, and the 1st Indorsement, dated 3 January 1977, also addressed to the Director of Lands by Mr. Claudio C. Batiles as the District Land Officer, photocopies of which are appended hereto as Annexes \"D\", \"E\", \"F\" and \"G\", respectively, unequivocally confirmed that the area of 29,945 sq. ms. (sic) covered by the Free Patent based on Plan F (III-1) 4496-D and issued to Macario Mencias was entirely inside Lot 89 of Plan II-4755, which was covered by T.C.T. No. 22395 in the name of \"J Antonio Araneta, Trustee of the children Angela I. Tauson\", and since 20 June 1969, by T.C.T. No. 257152 in the plaintiffs' names.\n\n9. There can be no doubt that the area of 29,945 sq. ms. (sic) covered by Free Patent No. 495269, which was incorporated in OCT No. 711 issued to Macario Mencias, was within Lot 89 of Plan II-4755 covered by T.C.T. No. 22395 and, since 20 June 1969, by T.C.T. No. 2597152 (sic) in the plaintiffs' names, because the technical description of said area embodied in the said Free Patent itself and in OCT No. 711 disclosed the following information:\n\"NOTE: This survey is covered by F.P.A. No. (III-1) 4496.\nThis survey is entirely inside No. 89, II-4755\" (See Annex \"B\" hereof). (See Annex \"B\" hereof). 10. In fact the very same notes were carried over in T.C.T. No. 186516 issued to the heirs of Mencias, the defendants herein, thus forewarning all those who dealt or may have dealt with the private defendants regarding the area therein described that there was something anomalous in said title (See Annex \"C\" hereof).\n\nx x x x\n\n14. The records of the Registry of Deeds of Marikina, Metro Manila, disclosed that TCT No. 186516, Annex \"C\", was cancelled and T.C.T. No. 271604, covering the same parcel of land covered by T.C.T. No. 186516, was issued on November 14, 1994 by the Register of Deeds of Marikina, Mr. Artemio B. Ca\u00f1a, to the New Atlantis Real Eastate & Dev., Inc. represented by its President, Victor C. Salvador, Jr., based on a sale in its favor inscribed on the same date; and that T.C.T. No. 271604 was thereupon cancelled and in lieu thereof T.C.T. No. 272191 was issued by the said Register of Deeds to private defendants Edward and Edwin Roco Tan on November 17, 1994 based on a sale in their favor inscribed on the same date.\u00a0 A photocopy of T.C.T. No. 272191 is hereto attached as Annex \"H\".\n\nx x x x\n\n16. Neither New Atlantis Real Estate & Dev. Inc., nor Edward Roco Tan and Edwin Roco Tan could claim to be purchasers in good faith not only because their titles are void and inexistent and could not possibly have any legal effect whatsoever but also because the \"NOTE\" cited in paragraphs 9 and 10 above, which likewise appears on T.C.T. No. 272191 itself, discloses the very basis for its nullity.\n\n17. The notice of the pendency of this action (Notice of Lis Pendens) was duly inscribed on T.C.T. No. 186516 on August 4, 1992 under Entry No. 274711, which notice has been carried over to T.C.T. No. 272191, a photocopy of which is hereto appended as Annex \"H\".\n\nx x x x. [16]\nThe foregoing averments were specifically denied by defendant heirs who raised, among others, the affirmative defense that respondents' TCT No. 22395 is void and that lot 89 is not found inside respondents' land.\u00a0 Thus \u2014 11. Lot 89 was never a part of the Mariquina Estate as shown in subdivision plan PSD 29965 as surveyed in December, 1950 up to June, 1951.\u00a0 This fact is also certified by the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal as early as 1967, a photo copy of said certification is hereto attached as Annex \"1\";\n\n12. Plaintiffs' own exhibits (Annexes \"E\", \"F\", in relation to Annex \"A\") show that lot 89 was never part of Original Certificate of Title (O.C.T.) No. 730 from which plaintiffs' alleged title was derived (T.C.T. No. 257152, Annex \"A\").\u00a0 In Annexes \"E\" and \"F\", Lot No. 89 of II-4755 is covered by O.C.T. No. 734 and not 730;\n\n13. T.C. T. No. 257152 is spurious, falsified, hence, null and void.\u00a0 This certificate of title was issued in lieu of T.C.T. No. 22395/T 389 as per Annex \"A\" of the Complaint.\u00a0 T.C.T. No.\u00a0 22395/T 389 was in turn issued in lieu of T.C.T. No. 45046 as shown in a document (T.C.T. No. 22395) hereto attached as Annex \"2\";\n\n14. It also appears that T.C.T. No. 22395 is a mere reconstitution of a lost/destroyed T.C.T. No. 45046 as shown on page 3 of T.C.T. No. 257152;\n\n15. Upon verification with the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal, T.C.T. No. 45046 covered a different parcel of land situated in San Juan, Rizal and measuring about 356 square meters only, photo copy of which is hereto attached as Annex \"3\" hereof;\n\nx x x x. [17]\nPetitioners asserted, inter alia , the affirmative defense of good faith and denied the material allegations of the complaint relating to the origin of the title of respondents; and the latter's claim that Lot 89 is covered by TCT No. 257152.\u00a0 Pertinent portions of the Answer state:\nIn further support of the Specific Denials and Affirmative Allegations herein set forth, and by way of Affirmative Defenses, defendants allege:\n\nx x x x\n\n4.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Defendants are innocent purchasers for value of the subject property.\u00a0 They had no knowledge, actual or constructive, of the alleged defect in their title, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 272191, or of the title of their predecessor-in-interest, the Corporation.\n\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 Plaintiff's (sic) notice of lis pendens alleged to have been duly inscribed on TCT No. 186516 on August 4, 1992 under Entry No, 274711 did not appear or was not annotated on the corporation's title, TCT No. 271604, which was issued on November 14, 1994 or long after the alleged inscription was made on the said title.\u00a0 Attached and made integral part hereof as Annex \"A\" is a copy of Corporation's title, TCT No. 271604.\n\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 Neither did said inscription appear or annotated on defendants' title, TCT No. 272191, which was issued on 17 November 1994.\u00a0 Attached and made integral part hereof as Annex \"B\" is a copy of TCT No. 272191.\n\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 It bears stressing that if the said inscription was duly made on 4 August 1992 as plaintiffs alleged, the same would have been annotated on TCT Nos. 271604 and 272191 which were issued long after the said entry was allegedly made.\u00a0 Obviously, if said entry does appear today on TCT No. 272191, it was made only recently or at the earliest, after the latter title was issued on 17 November 1994.\u00a0 But certainly said entry could not have been possibly made on 4 August 1992.\n\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 With the absence of the notice of lis pendens, defendants could not be charged with notice of any defect in their title No. 272191 nor their status as innocent purchasers for value be adversely affected by the same.\n\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 Neither does the note, \"this survey is covered by F.P.A. No. (III-1) 4496; This survey is entirely inside No. 89 II-4755.\" serve as sufficient notice to defendants of any defect in their title.\u00a0 Said note does not indicate or disclose that the subject property is covered by another title.\n\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the fact that the subject property was covered by TCT No. 271604 duly issued by the Registry of Deeds in the name of the corporation without any encumbrance, liens or adverse claims annotated thereon negates any possibility that the subject property belongs to any person other than the corporation. [18]\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the pleadings filed in the instant case generated the following issues: (1) whether respondents' TCT No. 257152 is valid; (2) whether Lot 89 is covered by TCT No. 257152; and (3) whether petitioners are purchasers in good faith.\u00a0 This is clearly not a proper case for judgment on the pleadings considering that the Answers tendered factual issues.\u00a0 The trial court rendered a summary judgment on March 21, 2003 and not a judgment on the pleadings.\n\nIn Narra Integrated Corporation v. Court of Appeals , [19] the Court explained the distinction between a proper case of summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings, in this wise:\nThe existence or appearance of ostensible issues in the pleadings, on the one hand, and their sham or fictitious character, on the other, are what distinguish a proper case for summary judgment from one for a judgment on the pleadings.\u00a0 In a proper case for judgment on the pleadings, there is no ostensible issue at all because of the failure of the defending party's answer to raise an issue.\u00a0 On the other hand, in the case of a summary judgment, issues apparently exist \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 i.e. facts are asserted in the complaint regarding which there is as yet no admission, disavowal or qualification; or specific denials or affirmative defenses are in truth set out in the answer\u00e2\u20ac\u2022but the issues thus arising from the pleadings are sham, fictitious or not genuine, as shown by affidavits, depositions, or admissions. x x x.\nIn any case, a summary judgment is likewise not warranted in this case as there are genuine issues which call for a full blown trial.\u00a0 A \"genuine issue\" is an issue of fact which requires the presentation of evidence as distinguished from a sham, fictitious, contrived or false claim.\u00a0 When the facts as pleaded appear uncontested or undisputed, then there is no real or genuine issue or question as to the facts, and summary judgment is called for.\u00a0 The party who moves for summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating clearly the absence of any genuine issue of fact, or that the issue posed in the complaint is patently unsubstantial so as not to constitute a genuine issue for trial. Trial courts have limited authority to render summary judgments and may do so only when there is clearly no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u00a0 When the facts as pleaded by the parties are disputed or contested, proceedings for summary judgment cannot take the place of trial. [20]\n\nIn the instant case, presentation of evidence is necessary to determine the validity of TCT No. 22395 from which respondents' title (TCT No. 257152) was derived.\u00a0 As alleged by defendant heirs, TCT No. 22395 was a mere reconstitution of TCT No. 45046, which per verification from the Register of Deeds of Rizal pertain to a different piece of land measuring only about 356 square meters and located in San Juan, Rizal.\u00a0 These allegations were never refuted by respondents, hence, they cannot be simply brushed aside by the trial court.\n\nMoreover, even assuming that the title of respondents' predecessors-in-interest (TCT No. 22395) is valid, the evidence at this stage is still insufficient to sustain the conclusion of the trial court that Lot 89 is inside respondents' land now covered by TCT No. 257152.\u00a0 The title appended by respondents in their complaint is a mere photocopy.\u00a0 Likewise, the document allegedly issued by the Bureau of Lands and presented by respondents to prove that Lot 89 is inside their land are also mere photocopies and not authenticated by said office.\u00a0 Furthermore, the title referred in the said documents as the origin of TCT No. 257152, is a different title, that is OCT No. 734 and not OCT No. 730.\u00a0 There is thus a need to present evidence to settle the issues in a full blown trial.\n\nIf the evidence show that the Free Patent and the OCT issued to petitioners' predecessors-in-interest is valid and or Lot 89 is not inside TCT No. 257152, then judgment should be rendered in favor of petitioners; and whether the latter acted in good or bad faith will no longer be a decisive issue in this case.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the title of petitioners' predecessors-in-interest is declared void, the defense of good faith may still be available to petitioners who claim to be purchasers in good faith and for value.\u00a0\u00a0 The rule is that a void title may be the source of a valid title in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value. [21] An innocent purchaser for value is one who buys the property of another, without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays a full and fair price for the same at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claims or interest of some other person in the property. [22]\n\nSince good faith is always presumed, [23] it was premature for the trial court to conclude that petitioners are not purchasers in good faith.\u00a0 Note that the complaint did not state that the notice of the pendency of this action was inscribed in the title of the Corporation from whom petitioners purchased the property.\u00a0 Petitioners even denied the presence of said inscription in their own title and in the title of the Corporation. [24] Neither the presence of the notation \"This survey is covered by F.P.A. No. (III-1) 4496; and This survey is entirely inside No. 89, II-4755,\" in the title of the Corporation automatically make petitioners purchasers in bad faith.\u00a0 In the absence of other evidence to explain said notation, bad faith, which is never presumed, cannot be charged against petitioners.\u00a0\u00a0 The notation that the disputed lot is covered by Free Patent Application No. (III-1) 4496, will not place the title in dubious light because the same is the number of the application for Free Patent of Macario Mencias, [25] petitioners' predecessor-in-interest.\u00a0 The same is true with respect to the notation in the title that the questioned lot is inside Lot 89.\u00a0 Considering that the title presented is a mere photocopy and that the notes appearing thereon do not indicate that the subject property is covered by any title, the trial court should have directed the parties to substantiate their respective allegations instead of rendering judgment.\u00a0 Indeed, in determining the propriety of rendering a motion for summary judgment, the lower court should take that view of the evidence most favorable to the party against whom it is directed, giving such party the benefit of all favorable inferences. [26]\n\nIn sum, we find that respondents failed to prove that presentation of evidence may be dispensed with in the present controversy.\u00a0 The instant case is neither a proper case for rendition of judgment on the pleadings nor of summary judgment.\u00a0 A full blown trial should therefore be conducted to resolve the issues raised by the parties.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the petition is GRANTED and the\u00a0 February 3, 2005 Decision and the\u00a0 July 6, 2005 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

NO. 151339, January 31, 2006 ]\n\nEDITHA M. FRANCISCO,PETITIONER, VS. ROQUE CO AND/OR MARIANO CO, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nEDITHA M. FRANCISCO,PETITIONER, VS. ROQUE CO AND/OR MARIANO CO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThe parcel of land that lies at the center of this case is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 44546, issued by the Quezon City Register of Deeds registered in the name of Pastora Baetiong. [1] It has spawned at least three (3) different cases involving the parties, spanning the course of three (3) decades. Before this Court is the third of the cases, the resolution of which ultimately hearkens back to the pronouncements made in the first two (2) cases. Appropriately, the main issue before us is the applicability of res judicata.\n\nThe legal controversy was first sparked after the death of Pastora Baetiong in 1975 by a complaint for accion publiciana filed against the heirs of Baetiong, including petitioner, by respondents Roque Co and Mariano Co, involving the above-mentioned parcel of land, and another property, covered by TCT No. 63531 issued by the Caloocan City Register of Deeds. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-38464 and assigned to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 101.\n\nThe said complaint was settled when the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement dated 10 November 1983, which was duly approved by the Branch 101. [2] In the Compromise Agreement, the parties acknowledged the heirs of Baetiong as the owner of the subject properties. Further, it was agreed upon that the heirs of Baetiong would lease to respondents a portion of the properties, totaling between 25,000 square meters to 30,000 square meters, covering land then already occupied by respondents. The lease agreement, which was contained in a Contract of Lease, was to subsist for 15 years commencing retroactively from 1 October 1983.\n\nFive (5) years after the execution of the Compromise Agreement and Contract of Lease, the heirs of Baetiong filed a Motion with the Quezon City, RTC, Branch 101, wherein they alleged that respondents were actually occupying a larger portion of their land than the 30,000 square meter limit agreed upon in the Compromise Agreement. They prayed that a commission be constituted for the proper enforcement of the Compromise Agreement.\n\nThe RTC granted the motion, but this action was challenged by respondents by way of a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP. No. 18032. This is the second of the three (3) cases earlier referred to. In a Decision rendered on 12 July 1990, the Court of Appeals reversed the RTC and declared that the judgment by compromise rendered in Civil Case No. Q-38464 \"was finally terminated and executed\". [3] The appellate court concluded that the constitution of a commission for the purpose of delineating the bounds of the leased portion of the property would serve no purpose, considering that the Compromise Agreement itself mandated that the parties immediately conduct a delineation of the subject property for proper inclusion in the Contract of Lease. According to the Court of Appeals, when the Contract of Lease was executed on the same day, the Compromise Agreement was already deemed to have been fully implemented and duly enforced. [4]\n\nThe Court of Appeals made several other conclusions which are worthy of note. It ruled that since the Contract of Lease specified that the leased portion had an area of \"approximately\" three (3) hectares (or 30,000 sq.m.), the area occupied by respondents was the same property agreed upon for lease by the parties in the Compromise Agreement. On the claim that the area leased was actually in excess of 7,659 sq. meters, the Court of Appeals held that the heirs of Baetiong were precluded by laches and negligence from asserting such claim, as they had remained silent for almost five years in contesting the subject area.\n\nIn sum, the Court of Appeals set aside the RTC order constituting a commission, and declared \"the judgment by compromise rendered in Civil Case No. Q-38464 as finally terminated and executed.\" This Decision attained finality after the Supreme Court declined to give due course to a petition for review filed by the heirs of Baetiong, through a Resolution dated 10 June 1991.\n\nFour (4) years later, or on 24 July 1995, petitioner filed a complaint for forcible entry against respondents before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City, docketed as Civil Case No. 13158. This is the instant case and the third of the cases earlier adverted to. Petitioner alleged therein that she was the owner in fee simple of a parcel of land, denominated as Lot No. 2-F-4, with an area of 5,679 square meters, encompassed under TCT No. 44546, which she inherited from her mother per a 1978 Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate which caused the subdivision of the property into several lots.\n\nPetitioner maintained that on 19 July 1995, respondents, through agents, entered Lot No. 2-F-4 and started fencing the said property. In their answer, respondents alleged that the property over which petitioner was asserting her rights was covered under the Contract of Lease which had been executed pursuant to the earlier Compromise Agreement. Respondents also cast doubt on the validity of the 1978 Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate. [5] Respondents also pointed out that assuming petitioner had a cause of action against them, the same was barred by res judicata, particularly the 12 July 1990 Decision of the Court of Appeals which had since attained finality.\n\nThe MeTC ruled in favor of petitioner in a Decision [6] dated 13 November 1996, such disposition being subsequently affirmed by the RTC on 31 March 1999. [7] The MeTC ruled that petitioner was indeed the owner and prior possessor of Lot No. 2-F-4, as evidenced by the Extra-Judicial Settlement. The MeTC also concluded that the Contract of Lease expressly delineated the coverage of the lease agreement as totaling only three (3) hectares, which according to the MeTC, excluded Lot No. 2-F-4 of the subdivision plan. [8] On the issue of res judicata, the MeTC and RTC found that res judicata did not apply, owing to the absence of the requisite of identity of causes of action. Both courts noted that the instant action concerned a complaint for forcible entry, while the earlier case pertained to the execution of a contract of lease.\n\nThe MeTC ordered the respondents to pay petitioner the amount of P500.00 per day beginning 21 July 1995 as reasonable compensation until the vacation of the property. The RTC likewise ordered that the case be remanded to the MeTC for immediate execution, and it appears that the judgment was executed while the case was litigated before the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn 17 August 2000, the Court of Appeals Thirteenth Division issued its Decision [9] reversing the rulings of the lower courts. The Court of Appeals ruled that the complaint for forcible entry was indeed barred by res judicata . It was held that while there was a difference in the forms of the two actions, there was nonetheless a similarity of causes of action in the two cases, as the same evidence would support and establish both the former and present causes of action. It was observed that the evidence to be presented by the contending parties in both actions was that which would support their allegation of having a better right to the possession of the subject property.\n\nThe appellate court expounded that that matter of preference of right of petitioners over the property by virtue of the lease contract was already settled by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 18032. As the Contract of Lease was still in effect at the time of the supposed forcible entry, petitioner was declared as having no basis in alleging such infraction. Moreover, the Court of Appeals ruled that the contention that Lot No. 2-F-4 was not included in the Contract of Lease had also been resolved in CA-G.R. SP. No 18032, particularly the declarations therein that:\nIt is very clear that the area now occupied by the lessee petitioners is the property that was actually agreed upon by the lessees-petitioners and private respondents-lessors as stipulated in said contract of lease. [10] The Court of Appeals also concluded that due to malicious prosecution, respondents were liable for moral damages of P30,000.00, exemplary damages of P20,000.00, and attorney's fees of P20,000.00.\n\nHence the present petition.\n\nPetitioner insists that res judicata does not apply in this case, owing to the difference between the two causes of actions. Petitioner also claims that Lot No. 2-F-4 stands outside the lots covered by the lease contract. Petitioner also argues that res judicata could apply only to facts and circumstances as they existed at the time the judgment was rendered. On this point, petitioner points out that four (4) years had elapsed between the final judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 18032 and the filing of the instant complaint, which was governed by new facts and conditions due to the intrusion by respondents into Lot No. 2-F-4.\n\nThe central issue obviously concerns the binding force of the decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 18032, which respondents claim bars the present complaint due to res judicata . On this score, the matter would be best illuminated by pointing out that there are two aspects to the doctrine of res judicata. The first, known as \"bar by prior judgment,\" is the effect of a judgment as a bar to the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand or cause of action. The second, known as \"conclusiveness of judgment,\" issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties involving a different cause of action. [11]\n\nThe lower courts, in considering the question of res judicata, seem to have taken into account only the first kind of res judicata, \"bar by prior judgment,\" which involves identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. [12] Indeed, the arguments of the parties, and the ratiocinations of the lower courts center on whether there was identity in the causes of action in the case for execution of the lease contract and that of forcible entry. If the case hinges on that point alone, it is easy to force a simplistic reading that a complaint for forcible entry involves a different cause of action or right-duty correlative from that concerning the enforcement of a lease contract, as well as for different reliefs.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeals, in reversing the lower courts, invoked Mendiola v. Court of Appeals, [13] which involved the application of the first kind of res judicata or \"bar by prior judgment.\" [14] In particular, the appellate court cited the rule from Mendiola that \"[t]he test of identity of causes of action lies not in the form of an action but on whether the same evidence would support and establish the former and present causes of action.\" [15] Applying this test, it does appear that the present ejectment case could be barred by the prior judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 18032. The earlier case attempted to establish that respondents were entitled to lease not more than three (3) hectares of TCT No. 44546. In the present case, petitioner is obliged to establish that respondent has no legal right to occupy the portion of TCT No. 44546 denominated as Lot No. 2-F-4. It is possible that the same evidence may be used to establish that petitioners could occupy in excess of three (3) hectares of TCT No. 44546 and they could also occupy Lot No. 2-F-4.\n\nStill, the Court considers the second facet of res judicata , \"conclusiveness of judgment\" as controlling in this case. Conclusiveness of judgment operates as a bar even if there is no identity as between the first and second causes of judgment. Under the doctrine, any right, fact, or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same. [16]\n\nEvidently, \"conclusiveness of judgment\" may operate to bar the second case even if there is no identity of causes of action. The judgment is conclusive in the second case, only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined, and not as to matters merely involved therein. [17]\n\nIn that regard, we now consider the effect of the declarations on several questions of fact and law earlier made by the Court of Appeals in its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 18032, a judgment that has since lapsed into finality. The relevant portion of the ruling stated:\nIn the case at bar, the parties in pursuance of the judgment by compromise, the substantive portion of which reads:\n\n\" . . . d. Area to be leased is that portion actually occupied with building constructions thereon in possession of defendants, more specifically bounded by the road with fence. This may be the subject of an ocular inspection by the parties'./p. 1, Supplemental Pre-Trial Brief of Defendants/ which area be duly delineated by a geodetic survey immediately to be conducted by a geodetic engineer chosen mutually by the parties, and in case of disagreement, by a team composed of three geodetic surveyors/engineers, 1 chosen by plaintiffs, 1 chosen by defendants, and the third to be chosen/commissioned by the Court, whose findings shall be final and binding between the parties, without right of any appeal, the costs of which shall be defrayed by the parties on a 50-50 basis\" . (Underscoring supplied.)\n\nexecuted simultaneously a lease contract, incorporating therein the terms and conditions agreed upon.\n\nThe Compromise Agreement speaks for itself. The delineation of the subject property was immediately to be conducted by both parties for proper inclusion in the Contract of Lease. Thus, when the Contract of Lease was executed, the Compromise Agreement have (sic) already been fully implemented and duly enforced. Hence, the constitution of a commission for the purpose of delineating the bounds of the property will serve no other purpose.\n\nAs regards the contention of the private respondent that the inclusion of the land in the Contract of Lease is in excess of what was really agreed upon deserves no scant consideration. The fact remains that the contract of lease specifically stipulates, thus:\n\n\" . . . certain portions of the above-mentioned parcels of land now actually occupied by the LESSEES with the warehouses/buildings constructed and owned by said LESSEESS, with a road and fences constructed by them, with an approximate area of Three (3) hectares more or less which is hereby delineated as per plan,\" (Underscoring supplied).\n\nIt is very clear that the area now occupied by the lessees- petitioners is the property that was actually agreed upon by the lessees-petitioners and private respondents-lessors as stipulated in said Contract of Lease.\n\nGranting that the area leased is really in excess of 7,659.84 sq. meters as claimed by respondents, the same is already precluded from asserting such contention. Records of the case show that respondents-lessors by their silence and inaction for almost five years in contesting the area subject of the lease constitutes laches that places them in estoppel to assert their alleged right under the compromise agreement. The Motion for Constitution of Commission to delineate the boundaries of the area subject matter of the lease should have been brought earlier before the execution of the contract of lease. Failure to assert this fact within a reasonable time warrants a presumption that the respondents either has abandoned it or declined to assert it. [18] There are important conclusions drawn from the quoted pronouncement which are of binding force in this case. First, the Compromise Agreement, which provided that the leased area be delineated by a geodetic survey instituted by both parties, was already deemed as fully implemented and enforced through the simultaneous execution of the Contract of Lease. Second, the Contract of Lease established that the area covered by the agreement constituted those portions of TCT No. 44546 then occupied by respondents, which as approximated as more or less three (3) hectares in area. Third, assuming that the area actually leased to respondents exceeded the stipulated three (3) hectares by 7,659.84 sq. meters (or .76 hectares), the heirs of Baetiong, petitioner among them, had since been barred from asserting such contention by reason of laches.\n\nIt should be understood that these pronouncements contained in the earlier Court of Appeals decision have the force of law between the parties. Since this decision establishes the right of respondents to occupy by way of lease a portion of TCT No. 44546 which may even exceed three (3) hectares, it thus becomes imperative for petitioner to establish her cause of action which is that respondent had beyond that which they were entitled to occupy according to the decision of the Court of Appeals. Following the Court of Appeals decision, respondents would be entitled to remain in possession of the portion which they were actually occupying at the time of the execution of the Contract of Lease even if such portion exceeded three (3) hectares.\n\nThe instant complaint predicated petitioner's cause of action on her alleged ownership of Lot No. 2-F-4, without any reference to the subsisting Contract of Lease. [19] In answer, respondents asserted that they had been in actual possession of the said portion since 1962. [20] The decision of the MTC did not dwell on this claim of respondents. Instead, it proceeded from the initial premise that petitioner's right of ownership over Lot No. 2-F-4 was evidenced by the Extra-Judicial Settlement, [21] then followed it with the following observations regarding the Contract of Lease:\nAs could be gleaned from the Contract of Lese dated November 10, 1993, executed between Roman Macabagdal, Edlinda Macabagdal-Francisco and Editha Macabagdal-Francisco (herein plaintiff) as Lessors and Mariano and Roque Co, as Lessees, the same covers only portions of the parcels of land being actually occupied by the defendants with the warehouses/buildings/fences constructed thereon by them at that time with an area of three (3) hectares or 30,000 sq. meters. As shown by the subdivision plan, the said area covers only Lots 2-E, 2-F-1 and 2-F-2, with a total area of 31,624 sq. meters. Hence, the intrusion of the defendants into Lot 2-F-4 with an area of 5,679 sq. meters, which is not covered by the said lease contract, clearly shows their unlawful deprivation of plaintiffs' possession over said property. [22] Evidently, the MeTC considered Lot No. 2-F-4 as beyond the scope of the lease agreement because the leased area, as shown by the subdivision plan, covered only three (3) particular lots, namely Lots No. 2-E, 2-F-1, and 2-F-2, with these three lots covering a total area of 3.1 hectares. But that was contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeals. Hence, in order that the trial court could rule in favor of petitioner without unsettling the earlier final and executory decision of the Court of Appeals, it should have been able to establish that Lot No. 2-F-4 was outside the coverage of the Contract of Lease as construed by the appellate court.\n\nThis being the case, it was not enough for petitioner to establish that she was the owner of Lot No. 2-F-4 which is the sole allegation in her complaint in support of her cause of action. Neither would it have been sufficient on her part to prove that the three (3) hectares contemplated in the Contract of Lease consisted only of Lots No. 2-E, 2-F-1, and 2-F-2. By reason of the conclusiveness of the final judgment of the Court of Appeals, it was essential on her part to establish that Lot No. 2-F-4 was not among that portion which respondents had been occupying at the time of the execution of the Contract of Lease. Had respondents not been occupying Lot No. 2-F-4 when the Contract of Lease was executed, petitioner would have had the right to seek the ejectment of respondents from the said lot, as the said portion would not have been among that which the Court of Appeals had earlier ruled respondents were entitled to possess by way of lease. However, since the right to institute an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer extends only in the absence of the right to hold possession, whether by virtue of any contract or otherwise, or upon the expiration of such right, the burden lies on petitioner as plaintiff to establish that respondents had no legal right to enter into possession of Lot No. 2-F-4. Such burden is further militated by the earlier binding declarations of the Court of Appeals on the scope in area of the Contract of Lease.\n\nMoreover, the Court of Appeals also ruled that petitioner was barred from challenging the possession in lease by respondents of an area exceeding the stipulated three (3) hectare limit. Certainly, petitioner cannot predicate her right to withhold Lot No. 2-F-4 from respondents' possession on the basis that such lot exceeds the three (3) hectares as stipulated in the compromise and lease agreements. As earlier stated, given the binding effect of the earlier Court of Appeals decision, the fact that petitioner would have to establish to accord merit to her complaint is that the subject lot was not in the possession of respondents at the time of the execution of the Contract of Lease, and thus not subject to the said contract.\n\nUnfortunately for petitioner, not only did she fail to establish such fact, her very cause of action is not even premised on that ground. The lower courts erred in maintaining blissful ignorance of the Court of Appeals decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 18032 and ruling for petitioner, despite the pronouncements made in that final and executory decision. Indeed, in order that ejectment could be justified, it was imperative on the lower courts to declare, after duly considering the earlier Court of Appeals Decision, that respondents had no existing legal right to possess Lot No. 2-F-4. No conclusion was drawn on such premises; thus, the reversal made by the Court of Appeals must be sustained.\n\nIt must be noted that the earlier Court of Appeals decision sustained respondents' right to occupy only a segregate portion of TCT No. 44546, particularly that which they had already been occupying at the time the Contract of Lease was executed. Had petitioner been able to establish before the trial court that Lot No. 2-F-4 is outside that portion already occupied by respondents when the lease contract was executed, her complaint may have been sustained. However, this question of fact was not preponderantly established in the lower courts, and there is no basis for the Court to now make such a de novo factual finding.\n\nOne last point. We must reverse the Court of Appeals when it awarded moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees to respondents. In ruling that petitioner was in bad faith in filing the instant suit, the appellate court predicated this conclusion on the observation that \"respondent was well-aware that the issue involved in this case has already been settled by the courts. Due to this, petitioners understandably suffered mental anguish and serious anxiety, thereby entitling them to moral damages.\" [23]\n\nThe Court is not wont to uphold awards of moral damages based on haphazard conjectures on the awardee's resultant mental state. We cannot agree with the appellate court that bad faith on the part of petitioner had been preponderantly established in this case. Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence, but it imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong. [24] It should be established by clear and convincing evidence since the law always presumes good faith. [25] In ascertaining the intention of the person accused of acting in bad faith, the courts must carefully examine the evidence as to the conduct and outward acts from which the inward motive may be determined. [26] Certainly, it does not appear that the Court of Appeals has conducted the mandated careful examination of evidence that would sustain the award of moral damages. Nothing in the record establishes any right to moral damages by respondents.\n\nNeither should exemplary damages avail under the circumstances. The plaintiff must show that he is entitled to moral, temperate or compensatory damages before the court may consider the question of whether exemplary damages should be awarded. [27] If the court has no proof or evidence upon which the claim for moral damages could be based, such indemnity could not be outrightly awarded. The same holds true with respect to the award of exemplary damages where it must be shown that the party acted in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner. Furthermore, this specie of damages is allowed only in addition to moral damages such that no exemplary damages can be awarded unless the claimant first establishes his clear right to moral damages. [28]\n\nContrary to the pronouncement of the Court of Appeals, the mere fact that petitioners were constrained to litigate in order to protect and assert their rights does not ipso facto entitle them to attorney's fees. What Article 2208 (2) of the Civil Code provides, in order that attorney's fees may be awarded, is that \"the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest\". It is settled that the fact that the party was \"compelled to litigate and incur expenses to protect and enforce their claim does not justify the award of attorney's fees. The general rule is that attorney's fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the public policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. The award of attorney's fees must be deleted where the award of moral and exemplary damages are eliminated.\" [29]\n\nWHEREFORE, the PETITION is GRANTED in PART. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 17 August 2000 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the award of moral, exemplary damages and attorney's fees are DELETED.

CABRERA AND DIONY VENTURA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThe instant petition for review on certiorari seeks the reversal of the Resolution [1] dated 13 May 1996 and the Order [2] dated 21 March 1997, both issued by the Office of the Ombudsman. The Resolution dismissed the complaint-affidavit filed by petitioner against respondents and the Order denied her motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe instant petition originated from a Complaint-Affidavit [3] filed in November 1995 by petitioner Amelia M. Cabrera with the Office of the Ombudsman (\"Ombudsman\"). Named respondents were Manuel Lapid, Fernando Baltazar, Reynaldo F. Cabrera and Superintendent Diony Ventura, respectively, in their capacities as Governor of Pampanga, Mayor of Sasmuan, Pampanga, Vice-Mayor of Sasmuan, Pampanga and Superintendent of the Philippine National Police (PNP)-Region 3, Pampanga. In her three(3)-page affidavit, petitioner accused respondents of violating Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Article 324 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nIn her Complaint-Affidavit, petitioner stated that she entered into a lease agreement with the Municipality of Sasmuan over a tract of land for the purpose of devoting it to fishpond operations. According to petitioner, she had spent approximately P5,000,000.00 for its construction before the fishpond operations commenced in August 1995. A month later, petitioner learned from newspaper reports of the impending demolition of her fishpond as it was purportedly illegal and blocked the flow of the Pasak River. Thus, petitioner sent the fishpond administrator to dissuade respondents from destroying her property. [4]\n\nDespite pleas from petitioner, respondents ordered the destruction of petitioner's fishpond. The property was demolished on 10 October 1995 by dynamite blasting. Petitioner alleged that the demolition was purposely carried out in the presence of media representatives and other government officials to gain media mileage. Petitioner imputed evident bad faith on respondents Mayor Baltazar and Vice-Mayor Cabrera in allowing the destruction of the fishpond despite their prior knowledge of the existence of the lease agreement. She also charged respondents Governor Lapid and Senior Superintendent Ventura with gross inexcusable negligence for ordering the destruction of the fishpond without first verifying its legality. [5]\n\nAt the preliminary investigation, respondents, except Senior Superintendent Ventura, submitted counter-affidavits, denying the accusations against them. In the counter-affidavit jointly filed by Mayor Baltazar and Vice-Mayor Cabrera, they insisted that contrary to petitioner's claim, the fishpond was an illegal structure because it was erected on the seashore, at the mouth of the Pasak River, and sat on an inalienable land. They claimed that the demolition was done by the Task Force Bilis Daloy upon the directive of then President Fidel V. Ramos. [6]\n\nIn his Counter-Affidavit, [7] Governor Lapid averred that the contract of lease between petitioner and the Municipality of Sasmuan, represented by then Mayor Abelardo Panlaqui, was executed two weeks before respondent Mayor Baltazar took his oath of office in 1995. Governor Lapid also argued that under the law, the Department of Agriculture (DA) is the government agency authorized to enter into licensing agreements for fishpond operations, and as per certification by the DA Regional Director, petitioner's fishpond operation was not covered by a fishpond lease agreement or application. Governor Lapid also referred to the certification by the Municipal Health Officer of Sasmuan issued before the actual demolition of the fishpond, describing it as a nuisance per se and recommending its abatement. [8]\n\nOn 13 May 1996, the Ombudsman issued the assailed Resolution, dismissing petitioner's complaint. The dismissal was based on the declaration that the fishpond was a nuisance per se and, thus, may be abated by respondents in the exercise of the police power of the State. [9]\n\nPetitioner sought reconsideration of the Resolution, arguing that under Sec. 149 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, the exclusive authority to grant fishery privileges is vested in the municipalities. Petitioner also questioned the certification by the Municipal Health Officer, alleging that the same was issued before the ocular inspection of the property which took place only on the day of the demolition. Petitioner also contended that a judicial proceeding was necessary to determine whether the property indeed had caused the flooding. [10] Respondents filed separate oppositions to petitioner's motion for reconsideration. [11] Petitioner filed a reply to the opposition [12] and respondent Governor Lapid filed a rejoinder to the reply. [13]\n\nIn the Order dated 21 March 1997, the Ombudsman affirmed its 13 May 1996 Resolution. It ruled that the repealing clause of R.A. No. 7160 expressly repealed only Sec. 2, 6 and 29 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 704 so that in harmonizing the remaining provisions of P.D. No. 704 and the provisions of R.A. No. 7160 applicable to the grant of fishery privileges, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) is the government agency authorized to grant fishpond license or permit in areas not identified as municipal waters or not declared as alienable or disposable by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Since it appears from DENR records that the subject property has not been declared disposable or included in areas devoted for fishpond development, the Ombudsman concluded that the lease agreement entered into by petitioner was void ab initio . In view of the illegality of the lease agreement, the Ombudsman ruled that its demolition was justified. The Ombudsman described the demolition as a valid exercise of police power and in accordance with the provision of Sec. 28 of P.D. No. 704 directing the removal of any fishpen or fishpond that obstructed the free navigation of a stream or lake. It also upheld the authority of the district health officer to determine the abatement of a nuisance without need of judicial proceedings. [14]\n\nPetitioner elevated the matter to this Court via a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to assail the 13 May 1996 Resolution and 21 March 1997 Order of the Ombudsman. Petitioner subsequently filed an amended petition for review on certiorari to implead the Ombudsman as respondent, although in a petition for review on certiorari, the tribunal whose issuance is assailed need not be impleaded as respondent.\n\nThe petition imputes the following errors on the Ombudsman:\nI.\n\nTHE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN ERRED AND EXCEEDED ITS AUTHORITY IN RULING THAT THE LEASE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPALITY OF SASMUAN AND PETITIONER IS NULL AND VOID.\n\nII.\n\nTHE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN ERRED IN RULING THAT THE DEMOLITION OF THE FISHPOND WAS VALIDLY MADE BY VIRTUE OF THE DECLARATION BY THE HEALTH OFFICER THAT IT WAS A NUISANCE PER SE.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN ERRED IN RULING THAT THE DEMOLITION IS PART OF THE PROPER EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER OF THE STATE.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN ERRED IN RULING THAT PETITIONER WAS GIVEN DUE NOTICE AND HEARING BEFORE THE FISHPOND WAS BLASTED.\n\nV.\n\nTHE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN ERRED IN RULING THAT PROBABLE CAUSE DOES NOT EXIST TO INDICT RESPONDENTS FOR VIOLATION OF THE SUBJECT OFFENSES. [15] Clearly, this is an appeal from the questioned issuances of the Ombudsman. However, such direct resort to this Court from a resolution or order of the Ombudsman is not sanctioned by any rule of procedure.\n\nNeither can petitioner avail of Sec. 27 [16] of R.A. No. 6770, otherwise known as The Ombudsman Act of 1989. The provision allowed direct appeals in administrative disciplinary cases from the Office of the Ombudsman to the Supreme Court. The right to appeal is granted only in respect to orders or decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases. [17] The provision does not cover resolutions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases. More importantly, Sec. 27 of R.A. No. 6770 insofar as it allowed a direct appeal to this Court was declared unconstitutional in Fabian v. Hon. Desierto . [18]\n\nHowever, an aggrieved party in criminal actions is not without any recourse. Where grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction taints the findings of the Ombudsman on the existence of probable cause, the aggrieved party may file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65. [19] The remedy from resolutions of the Ombudsman in preliminary investigations of criminal cases is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, not a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. [20]\n\nBut in this case, petitioner has taken the position that the Ombudsman has decided questions of substance contrary to law and the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court. That is a ground under a Rule 45 petition. Indeed, from a reading of the assignment of errors, it is clear that petitioner does not impute grave abuse of discretion to the Ombudsman in issuing the assailed Resolution and Order. Rather, she merely questions his findings and conclusions. As stated earlier, direct appeal to the Supreme Court via a petition for review on certiorari is not sanctioned by any rule of procedure. By availing of a wrong remedy, the petition should be dismissed outright.\n\nEven if the Court treats the instant appeal as a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, its dismissal is nevertheless warranted because petitioner failed to present, much more substantiate, any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Ombudsman.\n\nA careful reading of the questioned Resolution reveals that the Ombudsman dismissed petitioner's criminal complaint because respondents had validly resorted to the police power of the State when they effected the demolition of the illegal fishpond in question following the declaration thereof as a nuisance per se . Thus, the Ombudsman was of the opinion that no violation of Section 3(e) [21] of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act or of Article 324 [22] of the Revised Penal Code was committed by respondents. In the words of the Ombudsman, \"those who participated in the blasting of the subject fishpond were only impelled by their desire to serve the best interest of the general public; for the good and the highest good.\" [23]\n\nBy grave abuse of discretion is meant capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law. [24]\n\nGrave abuse of discretion should be differentiated from an error in judgment. An error of judgment is one which the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and which error is reversible only by an appeal. As long as the court acts within its jurisdiction, any alleged errors committed in the exercise of its discretion will amount to nothing more than mere errors of judgment, correctible by an appeal or a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. An error of jurisdiction is one where the act complained of was issued by the court without or in excess of jurisdiction and which error is correctible only by the extraordinary writ of certiorari. [25]\n\nThe other errors raised by petitioner pertain to the Ombudsman's opinion on the lack of probable cause to indict respondents. These are purported errors in judgment which can be corrected by an appeal, although not via a direct appeal to this Court. Direct resort to this Court may be had only through the extraordinary writ of certiorari and upon showing that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion, which petitioner failed to demonstrate.\n\nAbsent any grave abuse of discretion tainting it, the courts will not interfere with the Ombudsman's supervision and control over the preliminary investigation conducted by him. [26] It is beyond the ambit of this Court to review the exercise of discretion of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed before it. [27] The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they would be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.

RICHARD V. FUNK, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCORONA, J.:\n\nThe duty of the court is not only to see that a lawyer acts in a proper and lawful manner but also to ensure that a lawyer is paid his just fees. [1]\n\nThis is a case involving the failure to pay the balance of attorney's fees. The records show that on July 27, 1983, respondent Atty. Richard Funk was engaged by Teodoro Santos as counsel in Civil Case No. 45679 entitled Philbanking Corporation v. Santos Ventura Hocorma Foundation, Inc. [2] The agreed attorney's fee was 25% of the market value of the properties involved.\n\nRespondent was further retained by Santos to secure [3] several of the latter's properties. He transferred Santos' assets to petitioner Santos Ventura Hocorma Foundation, Inc. via a series of donations. The attorney's fee was 10% of the market value of the properties.\n\nOn August 13, 1983, Santos executed a special power of attorney (SPA) authorizing respondent to collect his attorney's fees from petitioner. [4] The SPA was confirmed by petitioner's Board of Trustees on December 13, 1983.\n\nPetitioner, however, only made partial payments [5] and refused to fully settle with respondent.Hence, respondent filed in the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 66, a claim for attorney's fees against petitioner and its officers. Petitioner and its officers moved for dismissal on the ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the case since it was an intra-corporate controversy between a non-stock corporation (petitioner) and one of its members (respondent). [6]\n\nThe trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The motion for reconsideration was also denied. Hence, on March 17, 1990, petitioner and its officers filed an answer.\n\nMeanwhile, in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 to the Court of Appeals (CA), [7] petitioner sought to set aside the denial of its motion to dismiss with prayer for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary writ of injunction. The CA ordered respondent to comment on the petition [8] and the proceedings before the trial court were temporarily suspended.\n\nOn June 29, 1990, the CA dismissed the petition for lack of merit. [9] It reasoned that, since the action was filed by respondent as a lawyer collecting attorney's fees based on a retainer agreement for services rendered, [10] the case was a collection suit cognizable by the regular courts. Petitioner did not file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal. On July 25, 1990, the CA decision in the petition for certiorari became final and executory. [11]\n\nOn February 14, 1994, the trial court [12] found petitioner liable to pay respondent his attorney's fees in the amount of P150,000 for Civil Case No. 45679 and P500,000 for his work in transferring Santos' assets to petitioner. [13]\n\nOn motion for reconsideration filed by respondent, the trial court increased respondent's attorney's fees for the transfer of the properties to P918,919.50. He was also declared co-owner of 10% of the properties [14] whose market values were not proven. [15]\n\nOn appeal, the CA affirmed the trial court's resolution [16] entitling respondent to 10% of the market value of the remaining properties but with the modification that there would be no right of co-ownership. [17]\n\nHence this recourse.\n\nThe petition is denied. [18]\n\nPetitioner challenges the jurisdiction of the trial court over the claim for attorney's fees but this issue was already settled in the June 29, 1990 CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 20646 sustaining the trial court. The decision has attained finality and entry of judgment was made on November 26, 1990. Hence, this issue cannot be resurrected anymore.\n\nThe next two issues raised by petitioner (whether the SPA was approved by petitioner's Board of Trustees and the reasonableness of the attorney's fees) are questions of fact which we are not at liberty to review. In a petition for review, only questions of law may be raised. The Supreme Court is not the proper venue to consider factual issues as it is not a trier of facts. [19]\n\nAccording to both the trial court and the CA, the minutes of the December 13, 1983 and March 5, 1984 [20] board meetings [21] showed that: (1) the SPA executed by Teodoro Santos, when presented to petitioner's Board of Trustees on December 13, 1983, was unanimously confirmed, acknowledged and approved and (2) petitioner even undertook to implement the retainer agreements between respondent and Teodoro Santos.\n\nThe trial court and CA likewise found that the award of attorney's fees was based on the retainer agreements and the pieces of evidence which supported the claim. Since no hard and fast rule may be set in the determination of what a reasonable fee is, it must be established from the facts of each case. As the CA is the final adjudicator of facts, this Court is bound by the former's findings on the propriety of the amount of respondent's attorney's fees.

NO. 167812, December 19, 2006 ]\n\nJESUS M. GOZUN, PETITIONER, VS JOSE TEOFILO T. MERCADO A.K.A. 'DON PEPITO MERCADO, RESPONDENT \nD E C I S I O N\nJESUS M. GOZUN, PETITIONER, VS JOSE TEOFILO T. MERCADO A.K.A. 'DON PEPITO MERCADO, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nOn challenge via petition for review on certiorari is the Court of Appeals' Decision of December 8, 2004 and Resolution of April 14, 2005 in CA-G.R. CV No. 76309 [1] reversing the trial court's decision [2] against Jose Teofilo T. Mercado a.k.a. Don Pepito Mercado (respondent) and accordingly dismissing the complaint of Jesus M. Gozun (petitioner).\n\nIn the local elections of 1995, respondent vied for the gubernatorial post in Pampanga. Upon respondent's request, petitioner, owner of JMG Publishing House, a printing shop located in San Fernando, Pampanga, submitted to respondent draft samples and price quotation of campaign materials.\n\nBy petitioner's claim, respondent's wife had told him that respondent already approved his price quotation and that he could start printing the campaign materials, hence, he did print campaign materials like posters bearing respondent's photograph, [3] leaflets containing the slate of party candidates, [4] sample ballots, [5] poll watcher identification cards, [6] and stickers.\n\nGiven the urgency and limited time to do the job order, petitioner availed of the services and facilities of Metro Angeles Printing and of St. Joseph Printing Press, owned by his daughter Jennifer Gozun and mother Epifania Macalino Gozun, respectively. [7]\n\nPetitioner delivered the campaign materials to respondent's headquarters along Gapan-Olongapo Road in San Fernando, Pampanga. [8]\n\nMeanwhile, on March 31, 1995, respondent's sister-in-law, Lilian Soriano (Lilian) obtained from petitioner \"cash advance\" of P253,000 allegedly for the allowances of poll watchers who were attending a seminar and for other related expenses. Lilian acknowledged on petitioner's 1995 diary [9] receipt of the amount. [10]\n\nPetitioner later sent respondent a Statement of Account [11] in the total amount of P2,177,906 itemized as follows: P640,310 for JMG Publishing House; P837,696 for Metro Angeles Printing; P446,900 for St. Joseph Printing Press; and P253,000, the \"cash advance\" obtained by Lilian.\n\nOn August 11, 1995, respondent's wife partially paid P1,000,000 to petitioner who issued a receipt [12] therefor.\n\nDespite repeated demands and respondent's promise to pay, respondent failed to settle the balance of his account to petitioner.\n\nPetitioner and respondent being compadres , they having been principal sponsors at the weddings of their respective daughters, waited for more than three (3) years for respondent to honor his promise but to no avail, compelling petitioner to endorse the matter to his counsel who sent respondent a demand letter. [13] Respondent, however, failed to heed the demand. [14]\n\nPetitioner thus filed with the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City on November 25, 1998 a complaint [15] against respondent to collect the remaining amount of P1,177,906 plus \"inflationary adjustment\" and attorney's fees.\n\nIn his Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim, [16] respondent denied having transacted with petitioner or entering into any contract for the printing of campaign materials. He alleged that the various campaign materials delivered to him were represented as donations from his family, friends and political supporters. He added that all contracts involving his personal expenses were coursed through and signed by him to ensure compliance with pertinent election laws.\n\nOn petitioner's claim that Lilian, on his (respondent's) behalf, had obtained from him a cash advance of P253,000, respondent denied having given her authority to do so and having received the same.\n\nAt the witness stand, respondent, reiterating his allegations in his Answer, claimed that petitioner was his over-all coordinator in charge of the conduct of seminars for volunteers and the monitoring of other matters bearing on his candidacy; and that while his campaign manager, Juanito \"Johnny\" Cabalu (Cabalu), who was authorized to approve details with regard to printing materials, presented him some campaign materials, those were partly donated. [17]\n\nWhen confronted with the official receipt issued to his wife acknowledging her payment to JMG Publishing House of the amount of P1,000,000, respondent claimed that it was his first time to see the receipt, albeit he belatedly came to know from his wife and Cabalu that the P1,000,000 represented \"compensation [to petitioner] who helped a lot in the campaign as a gesture of goodwill.\" [18]\n\nAcknowledging that petitioner is engaged in the printing business, respondent explained that he sometimes discussed with petitioner strategies relating to his candidacy, he (petitioner) having actively volunteered to help in his campaign; that his wife was not authorized to enter into a contract with petitioner regarding campaign materials as she knew her limitations; that he no longer questioned the P1,000,000 his wife gave petitioner as he thought that it was just proper to compensate him for a job well done; and that he came to know about petitioner's claim against him only after receiving a copy of the complaint, which surprised him because he knew fully well that the campaign materials were donations. [19]\n\nUpon questioning by the trial court, respondent could not, however, confirm if it was his understanding that the campaign materials delivered by petitioner were donations from third parties. [20]\n\nFinally, respondent, disclaiming knowledge of the Comelec rule that if a campaign material is donated, it must be so stated on its face, acknowledged that nothing of that sort was written on all the materials made by petitioner. [21]\n\nAs adverted to earlier, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of petitioner, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff having proven its (sic) cause of action by preponderance of evidence, the Court hereby renders a decision in favor of the plaintiff ordering the defendant as follows:\nTo pay the plaintiff the sum of P1,177,906.00 plus 12% interest per annum from the filing of this complaint until fully paid; To pay the sum of P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and the costs of suit. SO ORDERED. [22] Also as earlier adverted to, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action.\n\nIn reversing the trial court's decision, the Court of Appeals held that other than petitioner's testimony, there was no evidence to support his claim that Lilian was authorized by respondent to borrow money on his behalf. It noted that the acknowledgment receipt [23] signed by Lilian did not specify in what capacity she received the money. Thus, applying Article 1317 [24] of the Civil Code, it held that petitioner's claim for P253,000 is unenforceable.\n\nOn the accounts claimed to be due JMG Publishing House \u2013 P640,310, Metro Angeles Printing \u2013 P837,696, and St. Joseph Printing Press \u2013 P446,900, the appellate court, noting that since the owners of the last two printing presses were not impleaded as parties to the case and it was not shown that petitioner was authorized to prosecute the same in their behalf, held that petitioner could not collect the amounts due them.\n\nFinally, the appellate court, noting that respondent's wife had paid P1,000,000 to petitioner, the latter's claim of P640,310 (after excluding the P253,000) had already been settled.\nHence, the present petition, faulting the appellate court to have erred:\n. . . when it dismissed the complaint on the ground that there is no evidence, other than petitioner's own testimony, to prove that Lilian R. Soriano was authorized by the respondent to receive the cash advance from the petitioner in the amount of P253,000.00.\n\nx x x x . . . when it dismissed the complaint, with respect to the amounts due to the Metro Angeles Press and St. Joseph Printing Press on the ground that the complaint was not brought by the real party in interest.\n\nx x x x [25] By the contract of agency a person binds himself to render some service or to do something in representation or on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the latter. [26] Contracts entered into in the name of another person by one who has been given no authority or legal representation or who has acted beyond his powers are classified as unauthorized contracts and are declared unenforceable, unless they are ratified. [27]\n\nGenerally, the agency may be oral, unless the law requires a specific form. [28] However, a special power of attorney is necessary for an agent to, as in this case, borrow money, unless it be urgent and indispensable for the preservation of the things which are under administration. [29] Since nothing in this case involves the preservation of things under administration, a determination of whether Soriano had the special authority to borrow money on behalf of respondent is in order.\n\nLim Pin v. Liao Tian, et al . [30] held that the requirement of a special power of attorney refers to the nature of the authorization and not to its form.\n. . . The requirements are met if there is a clear mandate from the principal specifically authorizing the performance of the act. As early as 1906, this Court in Strong v. Gutierrez-Repide (6 Phil. 680) stated that such a mandate may be either oral or written. The one thing vital being that it shall be express. And more recently, We stated that, if the special authority is not written, then it must be duly established by evidence :\n\n\"...the Rules require, for attorneys to compromise the litigation of their clients, a special authority. And while the same does not state that the special authority be in writing the Court has every reason to expect that, if not in writing, the same be duly established by evidence other than the self-serving assertion of counsel himself that such authority was verbally given him.\" [31] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Petitioner submits that his following testimony suffices to establish that respondent had authorized Lilian to obtain a loan from him, viz :\nQ: Another caption appearing on Exhibit \"A\" is cash advance, it states given on 3-31-95 received by Mrs. Lilian Soriano in behalf of Mrs. Annie Mercado , amount P253,000.00, will you kindly tell the Court and explain what does that caption means?\n\nA: It is the amount representing the money borrowed from me by the defendant when one morning they came very early and talked to me and told me that they were not able to go to the bank to get money for the allowances of Poll Watchers who were having a seminar at the headquarters plus other election related expenses during that day, sir.\n\nQ: Considering that this is a substantial amount which according to you was taken by Lilian Soriano, did you happen to make her acknowledge the amount at that time?\n\nA: Yes, sir. [32] (Emphasis supplied) Petitioner's testimony failed to categorically state, however, whether the loan was made on behalf of respondent or of his wife. While petitioner claims that Lilian was authorized by respondent, the statement of account marked as Exhibit \"A\" states that the amount was received by Lilian \"in behalf of Mrs. Annie Mercado.\"\n\nInvoking Article 1873 [33] of the Civil Code, petitioner submits that respondent informed him that he had authorized Lilian to obtain the loan, hence, following Macke v. Camps [34] which holds that one who clothes another with apparent authority as his agent, and holds him out to the public as such , respondent cannot be permitted to deny the authority.\n\nPetitioner's submission does not persuade. As the appellate court observed:\n. . . Exhibit \"B\" [the receipt issued by petitioner] presented by plaintiff-appellee to support his claim unfortunately only indicates the Two Hundred Fifty Three Thousand Pesos (P253,0000.00) was received by one Lilian R. Soriano on 31 March 1995, but without specifying for what reason the said amount was delivered and in what capacity did Lilian R. Soriano received [ sic ] the money . The note reads:\n\n\"3-31-95\n\n261,120 ADVANCE MONEY FOR TRAINEE \u2013\nRECEIVED BY\n\nRECEIVED FROM JMG THE AMOUNT OF 253,000 TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND PESOS\n\n(SIGNED)\nLILIAN R. SORIANO\n3-31-95\"\n\nNowhere in the note can it be inferred that defendant-appellant was connected with the said transaction . Under Article 1317 of the New Civil Code, a person cannot be bound by contracts he did not authorize to be entered into his behalf. [35] (Underscoring supplied) It bears noting that Lilian signed in the receipt in her name alone, without indicating therein that she was acting for and in behalf of respondent. She thus bound herself in her personal capacity and not as an agent of respondent or anyone for that matter.\nIt is a general rule in the law of agency that, in order to bind the principal by a mortgage on real property executed by an agent, it must upon its face purport to be made, signed and sealed in the name of the principal, otherwise, it will bind the agent only . It is not enough merely that the agent was in fact authorized to make the mortgage, if he has not acted in the name of the principal. x x x [36] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) On the amount due him and the other two printing presses, petitioner explains that he was the one who personally and directly contracted with respondent and he merely sub-contracted the two printing establishments in order to deliver on time the campaign materials ordered by respondent.\n\nRespondent counters that the claim of sub-contracting is a change in petitioner's theory of the case which is not allowed on appeal.\n\nIn Oco v. Limbaring , [37] this Court ruled:\nThe parties to a contract are the real parties in interest in an action upon it, as consistently held by the Court. Only the contracting parties are bound by the stipulations in the contract; they are the ones who would benefit from and could violate it. Thus, one who is not a party to a contract, and for whose benefit it was not expressly made, cannot maintain an action on it. One cannot do so, even if the contract performed by the contracting parties would incidentally inure to one's benefit . [38] (Underscoring supplied) In light thereof, petitioner is the real party in interest in this case. The trial court's findings on the matter were affirmed by the appellate court. [39] It erred, however, in not declaring petitioner as a real party in interest insofar as recovery of the cost of campaign materials made by petitioner's mother and sister are concerned, upon the wrong notion that they should have been, but were not, impleaded as plaintiffs.\n\nIn sum, respondent has the obligation to pay the total cost of printing his campaign materials delivered by petitioner in the total of P1,924,906, less the partial payment of P1,000,000, or P924,906.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated December 8, 2004 and the Resolution dated April 14, 2005 of the Court of Appeals are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE .\n\nThe April 10, 2002 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, Branch 57, is REINSTATED mutatis mutandis, in light of the foregoing discussions. The trial court's decision is modifiED in that the amount payable by respondent to petitioner is reduced to P924,906.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Andres B.

      "title": "will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September, 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of [Luciano Tan] as of June, 2000, on or before June 30, 2000; and2.) [Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000.[8]On 14 August 2000, Luciano Tan filed a Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals,[9] averring therein that he had agreed to pay all the rentals due on the subject premises and to pay the subsequent monthly rentals as they fall due; that the rentals in arrears from September 1997 amounted to P467,500.00; and in line with his good faith in dealing with Rodil Enterprises, he would like to deposit the aforesaid amount, and the subsequent monthly rentals as they fall due. He prayed that he be allowed to deposit the Manager's Check for the amount of P467,500.00, made payable to the City Treasurer of Manila. However, on 15 August 2000, the MeTC denied the Motion on the rationalization that Luciano Tan's prayer to deposit the specified sum with the City Treasurer of Manila contravenes Section 19,[10] Rule 70 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.Subsequently, the issues for the resolution of the MeTC were synthesized by the court in its Order, dated 25 July 2000, to wit:[T]he issue insofar as [Rodil Enterprises], revolved on:\"Whether [Rodil Enterprises] is legally entitled to collect from [Luciano Tan] the amount of rentals and interest thereon as prayed for in the complaint and to ask for the ejectment of the defendant from the leased premises.\"On the other hand, [Luciano Tan]'s counsel formulated the issues of the case in the following manner[,] to wit:1) Whether or not under the circumstances[,][Luciano Tan] could be ejected from the premises in question;2) Whether or not under the circumstances[,] [Rodil Enterprises] should be made to return the amounts collected from [Luciano Tan] from 1987 to 1997 amounting to P988,650.00.[11]On 6 October 2000, the MeTC rendered a Decision in favor of Rodil Enterprises. The court said that Luciano Tan did not contest the sublease on a monthly basis, and in fact admitted in judicio, viz:1) That [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of the defendant as of June, 2000, on or before June 30, 2000; and2) [[Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00, on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000.(Order dated June 27, 2000)[12]According to the MeTC, notwithstanding the evidentiary norm in civil cases that an offer of compromise is not an admission of any liability, and is not admissible in evidence against the offeror, the court cannot overlook the frank representations by Luciano Tan's counsel of the former's liability in the form of rentals, coupled with a proposal to liquidate.[13] The foregoing gestures, as appreciated by the MeTC, were akin to an admission of a fact, like the existence of a debt which can serve as proof of the loan, and was thus, admissible.[14] The court pronounced that Luciano Tan had explicitly acknowledged his liability for the periodic consideration for the use of the subleased property. Estoppel, thus, precludes him from disavowing the fact of lease implied from the tender of payment for the rentals in arrears.[15] The MeTC, explained further: Prescinding from the foregoing discourse, it ineluctably follows that [Luciano Tan]'s indifference to heed the two demand letters, the cognition of which were recognized (paragraphs VII and IX, Complaint; paragraph 2, Answer), rendered him a deforciant (1 Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium, 6th Revised Edition, 1997, page 770, citing Dikit vs. Ycasiano, 89 Phil. 44), and was thus vulnerable to the special civil action under Section 1, Rule 70 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, especially so when non-payment of rentals is an accepted prelude to, and a secondary matrix for, a tenant's eviction (Article 1673 (2), New Civil Code).From a different plane, [Luciano Tan]'s quest at this juncture for recovery of the rentals he paid to the plaintiff from 1987 to 1997 will not merit the desired result since, in a manner of speaking, it will place the cart ahead of the horse, when juxtaposed with another pending controversy between the parties before the Supreme Court (Annex \"1,\" Position Paper for the Defendant; Annex \"B,\" Answer to Counterclaim).The decretal portion of the Decision, states, viz:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of [Rodil Enterprises], ordering:Defendant Luciano Tan, and all persons claiming rights under him, to vacate the subject realty, and to peacefully deliver possession to the plaintiff's representative;Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the sum of FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PESOS (P440,000.00) as recognized unpaid rentals from September, 1997 up to June 30, 2000;Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the sum of THIRTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS (P13,750.00) as agreed rental per month, starting July, 2000, and every month thereafter, until possession is delivered to the plaintiff's representative;Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the sum of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) as reasonable attorney's fees; andDefendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the cost of suit.For want of merit, defendant's counterclaim is hereby DISMISSED.IT IS SO ORDERED.[16]Aggrieved thereby, Luciano Tan appealed the Decision to the RTC. Meanwhile, Rodil Enterprises filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution,[17] which was subsequently denied by the MeTC in the Order[18] of 15 December 2000. On 18 June 2001, the RTC rendered a Decision reversing the judgment appealed from and dismissing the Complaint. It found that the MeTC erred in holding that the offer to compromise by Luciano Tan's counsel was akin to an admission of fact, the same being contrary to Section 27,[19] Rule 130 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. As reasoned by the RTC: During the pre-trial conference held in the lower court, proposals and counter-proposals emanated from the parties' counsels, which was normally inspired by the desire to \"buy peace\", nay, to put an end to the troubles of litigation, and to promote settlement of disputes as a matter of public policy. The act of defendant/appellant's (sic) in the midst of pre-trial is not an admission of any liability and therefore, should not be considered admissible evidence against him.[20]Proceeding to the issue of the right of Rodil Enterprises to collect rentals and eject Luciano Tan based on the contracts, dated 18 May 1992 and 25 May 1992, the RTC ruled that the controversy is still pending before the Supreme Court. It, thus, held that the prayer for recovery of rentals from 1987 to 1997 is premature.The RTC, disposed, as follows:IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the judgment appealed from is hereby REVERSED, and a new judgment is hereby entered DISMISSING the complaint in Civil Case No. 166584 for utter lack of merit.[21]Subsequently, Rodil Enterprises filed a Petition for Review with the appellate court, which, in a Decision dated 21 October 2002 set aside the judgment of the RTC, and affirmed and reinstated the 6 October 2000 Decision of the MeTC.According to the appellate court, there is, between Rodil Enterprises and the Republic of the Philippines, a valid and subsisting Contract of Lease executed on 18 October 1999, the same for a period of fifteen (15) years.[22] The period of the lease, under the 18 October 1999 contract is from 1 September 1997 to 31 August 2012. The Court of Appeals gave credence to the fact that the existence of the aforesaid contract was not denied nor controverted by Luciano Tan. What Luciano Tan, instead, impugned was the validity of the contracts dated 18 and 25 May 1992, which was upheld by this Court in the consolidated cases of Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, Carmen Bondoc, Teresita Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear and Chua Huay Soon (G.R. No. 129609) and Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. (G.R. No. 135537).[23]Ruling on the more important question of whether Luciano Tan made a judicial admission anent his liability as a sublessee of Rodil Enterprises, the Court of Appeals held that the former made an implied admission of the existence of a contract of sublease between him and Rodil Enterprises on the subject premises; and that he had reneged in the payment of rentals since 1 September 1997. Moreover, it deemed Luciano Tan's Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals as another admission in favor of Rodil Enterprises. The appellate court elucidated, thus:The evidence on record indubitably shows that respondent [Luciano Tan] is a sublessee of petitioner [Rodil Enterprises] who failed to pay rentals from 01 September 1997 and even until the case was filed before the [M]etropolitan [T]rial [C]ourt, when respondent [Luciano Tan] \"agreed in principle in open court\" to the following terms:1) that the defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September, 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of the defendant as of June, 2000, on or before June 30, 2000; and2) defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000.at the hearing on 27 June 2000 though no settlement was eventually reached between the parties, respondent [Luciano Tan] in effect made an implied judicial admission that there was a subsisting contract of sublease between him and petitioner, and that he was remiss in the payment of rentals from 01 September 1997 up to that day (Rollo, Annex \"9\" of petition). Respondent [Luciano Tan]'s admission was further bolstered by the fact that he filed a \"Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals\" (Rollo, p. 3 of Annex \"15\" of petition). By such acts, respondent [Luciano Tan] accepted the truth of petitioner [Rodil Enterprises'] allegation of the existence of a contract of sublease between them and of his non-payment of the rentals from 01 September 1997. A judicial admission is an admission made in the course of the proceedings in the same case, verbal or written, by a party accepting for the purposes of the suit the truth of some alleged fact, which said party cannot thereafter disprove (Remedial Law by Herrera, Oscar M. citing Section 4, Rule 129 of the Revised Rules on Evidence and Evidence by Salonga).[24]The decretal portion of the 21 October 2002 Court of Appeals' Decision, states, thus:WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the petition for review is GIVEN DUE COURSE. The Decision dated 18 June 2001 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 26 is hereby SET ASIDE. The Decision dated 06 October 2000 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 13 is AFFIRMED and REINSTATED.[25]The appellate court denied Luciano Tan's Motion for Reconsideration thereon, in a Resolution,[26] dated 12 May 2005.Thus, petitioner comes before us, raising the following grounds, to wit:ITHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ISSUED ITS RESOLUTION DENYING PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ITS DECISION BY RELYING SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY ON THE MARCH 28, 2005 DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SAID DECISION HAS NOT YET BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.IIRESPONDENT RODIL ENTERPRISES IS GUILTY OF FORUM SHOPPING WHEN IT FILED THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS DOCKETED AS CA-G.R. SP. NO. 79517 SEEKING TO NULLIFY THE ORDER OF EXECUTION BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF ITS 8 FEBRUARY 1994 DECISION IN OP CASE NO. 4968, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ITS PREVIOUS PETITION FOR REVIEW FILED WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE SAME DECISION OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DATED 8 FEBRUARY 1994 HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS IN ITS RESOLUTION DATED NOVEMBER 17, 1994 DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH PROCEDURAL RULES.IIITHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS REVERSIBLE ERROR AND A GRAVE MISAPPREHENSION OF THE FACTS AND MISAPPRECIATION OF THE EVIDENCE WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER IS A SUBLESSEE OF RESPONDENT AND THAT PETITIONER WAS REMISS IN THE PAYMENT OF HIS RENTALS OVER THE PREMISES.[27]The Petition is without merit.We shall address the first ground raised by petitioner with regard to the alleged reliance of the Court of Appeals on the Decision of the Tenth Division of the same court, dated 28 March 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 79157, entitled, Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. The Office of the President and Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc.[28]Contrary to petitioner's contention, we do not find that the Court of Appeals was in error when it took notice of the ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 in resolving petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. As respondent Rodil Enterprises asseverated, for the appellate court to ignore a decision rendered by a division thereof would be to turn a blind eye on a valid judgment rendered by the same appellate body. Neither can we give merit to petitioner's submission that the reliance by the Court of Appeals on its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 is premature and misplaced. More significantly, the contention of the petitioner that the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 has not attained finality has become mute when viewed within recent factual developments. The ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 has long reached finality. This Court in a Resolution[29] dated 25 January 2006 denied the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. thereon. On 20 March 2006, this Court denied with finality the Motion for Reconsideration of the 25 January 2006 Resolution for lack of compelling reason or substantial argument.[30]Moreover, on 12 April 2004, the appellate court issued a Resolution,[31] granting petitioner a hearing on its Motion for Reconsideration as the grounds cited therein needed further clarification. This belies petitioner's claim that the resolution on the Motion for Reconsideration was based solely on the ruling of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517. We come to the second ground raised by the petitioner. Petitioner argues that Rodil Enterprises is guilty of forum shopping when it filed the Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 79157,[32] after it filed an Appeal with the appellate court in CA-G.R. SP No. 34586.[33] Forum shopping is the act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, seeking another and possibly favorable opinion in another forum other than by appeal or special civil action of certiorari.[34]The question of forum shopping is not even material to the instant petition.It must be emphasized that neither CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 nor CA-G.R. SP No. 34586 is before this Court for consideration. These cases are separate and distinct from CA-G.R. SP No. 67201 now before us.What are assailed in the instant Petition are the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated 21 October 2002 and the Resolution, dated 12 May 2005 in CA G.R. SP No. 67201, which reversed the ruling of the RTC, and affirmed the MeTC, ordering Luciano Tan to vacate the premises and peacefully deliver possession to Rodil Enterprises. The matter in controversy is the refusal of Luciano Tan to pay the monthly rentals over Botica Divisoria under the contract of sublease between the parties.On the other hand, CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 was a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to nullify the Order of Execution of the Office of the President of its 8 February 1994 Decision in OP Case No. 4968 finding the Renewal of Contract of Lease, and the Supplemental Contract of no force and effect. CA-G.R. SP No. 34586 was an appeal on the Decision in O.P. Case No. 4968, which was the basis of the Order of Execution. If there has indeed been forum shopping when CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 was instituted during the pendency of CA-G.R. SP No. 34586, such question should have been raised by petitioner, at first instance, before the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517. It should be noted that the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 was already given due course by the Court of Appeals and its ruling therein has long attained finality when, on appeal to this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 169892, we denied the said appeal with finality in our Resolutions dated 25 January 2000 and dated 20 March 2006. Whatever matters concerning the said case is now beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to resolve.We proceed to the final ground raised by the petitioner for the allowance of the instant Petition. Petitioner assails the factual findings of the Court of Appeals when it ruled that there was a judicial admission as to petitioner's liability under a contract of sublease between him and Rodil Enterprises. To resolve this issue, a reading of the significant orders of the MeTC and the pleadings filed by petitioner is warranted.The MeTC issued an Order, dated 27 June 2000 of the following import, to wit:On second call, the parties and counsel agreed in principle in open court to the following terms to put an end to this civil case for ejectment between them:1.) that the defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September, 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of the defendant as of June, 2000 on or before June 30, 2000; and2.) the defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000.[35]On 14 August 2000, petitioner filed a Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals with the MeTC, praying that he be allowed to deposit the rentals due as of August 2000, in the amount of P467,500.00, and the subsequent monthly rentals as it falls due.Petitioner posits that the aforesaid admission, made in open court, and then, reiterated in his Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals, cannot be taken as an admission of his liability, citing Section 27, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court,[36] which states, inter alia, that an offer of compromise in a civil case is not a tacit admission of liability. The general rule is an offer of compromise in a civil case is not an admission of liability. It is not admissible in evidence against the offeror.The rule, however, is not iron-clad. This much was elucidated by this Court in Trans-Pacific Industrial Supplies, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,[37] to wit:To determine the admissibility or non-admissibility of an offer to compromise, the circumstances of the case and the intent of the party making the offer should be considered. Thus, if a party denies the existence of a debt but offers to pay the same for the purpose of buying peace and avoiding litigation, the offer of settlement is inadmissible. If in the course thereof, the party making the offer admits the existence of an indebtedness combined with a proposal to settle the claim amicably, then, the admission is admissible to prove such indebtedness (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 5, p. 233 [1980 ed.]); Francisco, Rules of Court, Vol. VII, p. 325 [1973 ed.] citing McNiel v. Holbrook, 12 Pac. (US) 84, 9 L. ed., 1009). Indeed, an offer of settlement is an effective admission of a borrower's loan balance (L.M. Handicraft Manufacturing Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 186 SCRA 640 [1990]. x x x.[38]Similarly, in the case of Varadero de Manila v. Insular Lumber Co.[39] the Court applied the exception to the general rule. In Varadero' there was neither an expressed nor implied denial of liability, but during the course of the abortive negotiations therein, the defendant expressed a willingness to pay the plaintiff. Finding that there was no denial of liability, and considering that the only question discussed was the amount to be paid, the Court did not apply the rule of exclusion of compromise negotiations.In the case at bar, the MeTC and the Court of Appeals properly appreciated petitioner's admission as an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility. The MeTC found that petitioner did not contest the existence of the sublease, and his counsel made frank representations anent the former's liability in the form of rentals. This expressed admission was coupled with a proposal to liquidate. The Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals was deemed by the MeTC as an explicit acknowledgment of petitioner's liability on the subleased premises. The Court of Appeals agreed with the MeTC. Indeed, the existence of the Contract of Lease, dated 18 October 1999 was not denied by petitioner. The contracts that were assailed by petitioner are the contracts dated 18 and 25 May 1992, the validity of which has been upheld by this Court in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 129609 and G.R. No. 135537.Finally, we find a categorical admission on the part of petitioner, not only as to his liability, but also, as to the amount of indebtedness in the form of rentals due. The Order of the MeTC dated 27 June 2000 was clear that the petitioner agreed in open court to pay the amount of P440,000.00, representing petitioner's unpaid rentals from September 1997 to June 2000; and that petitioner will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after 30 June 2000. The petitioner's judicial admission in open court, as found by the MeTC, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals finds particular significance when viewed together with his Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals, wherein petitioner stated that the rentals due on the premises in question from September 1997 up to the present amounted to P467,500.00, as of the date of filing the Motion. Petitioner cannot now be allowed to reject the same. An admission made in the pleading cannot be controverted by the party making such admission and are conclusive as to him, and that all proofs submitted by him contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith should be ignored whether objection is interposed by a party or not.[40] A judicial admission is an admission made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, for purposes of the truth of some alleged fact, which said party cannot thereafter disprove.[41] WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated 21 October 2002 and the Resolution dated 12 May 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 67201, affirming and reinstating the 6 October 2000 Decision of the MeTC in Civil Case No. 166584 are AFFIRMED.

RODIL ENTERPRISES, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nThe instant Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the Decision [1] dated 21 October 2002 and the Resolution [2] dated 12 May 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 67201, which set aside the 18 June 2001 Decision [3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 26 in Civil Case No. 01-99797. The RTC reversed the 6 October 2000 Decision [4] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Manila, Branch 13 in Civil Case No. 166584, and dismissed the Complaint filed by respondent Rodil Enterprises against petitioner Luciano Tan for utter lack of merit.\n\nThis case has its origin from the Complaint [5] for Unlawful Detainer filed on 13 March 2000 by Rodil Enterprises against Luciano Tan with the MeTC of Manila, Branch 13, docketed as Civil Case No. 166584.\n\nThe factual antecedents to the filing of the Complaint show that Rodil Enterprises is a lessee of the subject premises, the Ides O'Racca Building since 1959. The Ides O'Racca Building, located at the corner of M. de Santos and Folgueras Streets in Binondo, Manila, is owned by the Republic of the Philippines. On 18 May 1992, Rodil Enterprises and the Republic, through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), entered into a Renewal of a Contract of Lease over the Ides O'Racca Building. A subsequent Supplementary Contract dated 25 May 1992 was similarly entered into, thus, extending the lease agreement until 1 September 1997.\n\nThe validity of the 18 May 1992 and the 25 May 1992 contracts was placed in question in several actions involving Rodil Enterprises, the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc., and other tenants. This Court upheld the validity of the aforesaid contracts in a Decision rendered on 29 November 2001, in the consolidated cases of Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, Carmen Bondoc, Teresita Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear and Chua Huay Soon (G.R. No. 129609) and Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. (G.R. No. 135537) . [6]\n\nPrior thereto, the Office of the President in OP Case No. 4968 entitled, Spouses Saturnino B. Alvarez and Epifania Binay Alvarez v. Rodil Enterprises Company, Inc. rendered a Decision [7] dated 8 February 1994, declaring the Renewal of Contract of Lease and the Supplementary Contract, dated 18 May 1992 and 25 May 1992, respectively, of no force and effect.\n\nIt appears that Rodil Enterprises appealed the 8 February 1994 Decision to the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 34586 which was dismissed by the appellate court for non-compliance with procedural requirements. The dismissal was appealed by Rodil Enterprises to the Supreme Court, docketed as G.R. No. 119711 which was also dismissed. Subsequently, the Office of the President issued an Order of Execution of its 8 February 1994 Decision in OP Case No. 4968. Thereafter, Rodil Enterprises filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari with the Court of Appeals on the Order of Execution, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No 79157 . The Court of Appeals rendered a Decision therein dated 28 March 2005 which annulled the Order of Execution, and enjoined the Office of the President from enforcing its 8 February 1994 Decision in OP Case No. 4968. Likewise, the Court of Appeals ordered the Office of the President to abide by the 29 November 2001 Decision of the Supreme Court in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 129609 and G.R. No. 135537, upholding the validity of the Renewal of Contract of Lease and the Supplemental Contract, dated 18 May 1992 and the 25 May 1992, respectively. Finally, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 was brought on certiorari by the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. to the Supreme Court, and docketed as G.R. No. 169892. On 25 January 2006, the Court, in G.R. No. 169892, issued a Resolution denying the Petition. On 20 March 2006, a Resolution was rendered in the same case denying with finality the amended Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nMeanwhile, during the pendency of the preceding cases, on 18 October 1999, a subsequent Contract of Lease was drawn between Rodil Enterprises and the Republic, the same to be effective retroactively from 1 September 1997 to 21 August 2012 at a monthly rental of P65,206.67, subject to adjustment upon the approval of a new appraisal covering the Ides O'Racca Building. Rodil Enterprises subleased various units of the property to members of the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. A space thereof, known as Botica Divisoria was subleased to herein petitioner, Luciano Tan.\n\nIn Rodil Enterprises' Complaint for Unlawful Detainer filed against Luciano Tan, the former alleged that Luciano Tan bound himself to pay under a Contract of Sublease, the amount of P13,750.00 as monthly rentals, representing the reasonable use and occupancy of the said premises. However, Luciano Tan unjustifiably and unreasonably refused to pay the rentals from September 1997 up to the time of the filing of the Complaint, and despite repeated oral and written demands, refused to vacate the premises and to pay the rents due. Rodil Enterprises prayed that Luciano Tan and those claiming rights under him be ordered to vacate the leased premises. A payment of rentals in arrears, amounting to P385,000.00 was similarly sought, including attorney's fees and litigation costs, as well as, subsequent monthly rentals in the amount of P13,750.00 until Luciano Tan vacates Botica Divisoria.\n\nIn his Answer, Luciano Tan insists that he is a legitimate tenant of the government who owns the Ides O'Racca Building and not of Rodil Enterprises. As such, he has the right to lease the said premises pending the disposition and sale of the building. He based his claim on the fact that on 8 February 1994, the Office of the President in OP Case No. 4968, had declared the Renewal of Contract of Lease dated 18 May 1992 and the Supplemental Contract dated 25 May 1992 between Rodil Enterprises and the Republic to be without force and effect. Accordingly, the DENR was directed to award the lease contract in favor of the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. of which Luciano Tan is a member. He, thus, prayed for the dismissal of the Complaint, and for the return of whatever amount Rodil Enterprises had collected from 1987 to 1997, or during such time when he was still paying rentals to the latter.\n\nOn 27 June 2000, the MeTC issued an Order, recognizing an agreement entered into in open court by Luciano Tan and Rodil Enterprises. The Order, inter alia , declared, thus:\nOn second call, the parties and counsel agreed in principle in open court to the following terms to put an end to this civil case for ejectment between them:\n\n1.) that [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September, 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of [Luciano Tan] as of June, 2000, on or before June 30, 2000; and\n\n2.) [Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000. [8] On 14 August 2000, Luciano Tan filed a Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals, [9] averring therein that he had agreed to pay all the rentals due on the subject premises and to pay the subsequent monthly rentals as they fall due; that the rentals in arrears from September 1997 amounted to P467,500.00; and in line with his good faith in dealing with Rodil Enterprises, he would like to deposit the aforesaid amount, and the subsequent monthly rentals as they fall due. He prayed that he be allowed to deposit the Manager's Check for the amount of P467,500.00, made payable to the City Treasurer of Manila. However, on 15 August 2000, the MeTC denied the Motion on the rationalization that Luciano Tan's prayer to deposit the specified sum with the City Treasurer of Manila contravenes Section 19, [10] Rule 70 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nSubsequently, the issues for the resolution of the MeTC were synthesized by the court in its Order, dated 25 July 2000, to wit:\n[T]he issue insofar as [Rodil Enterprises], revolved on:\n\n\"Whether [Rodil Enterprises] is legally entitled to collect from [Luciano Tan] the amount of rentals and interest thereon as prayed for in the complaint and to ask for the ejectment of the defendant from the leased premises.\"\n\nOn the other hand, [Luciano Tan]'s counsel formulated the issues of the case in the following manner[,] to wit:\n\n1) Whether or not under the circumstances[,][Luciano Tan] could be ejected from the premises in question;\n\n2) Whether or not under the circumstances[,] [Rodil Enterprises] should be made to return the amounts collected from [Luciano Tan] from 1987 to 1997 amounting to P988,650.00. [11] On 6 October 2000, the MeTC rendered a Decision in favor of Rodil Enterprises. The court said that Luciano Tan did not contest the sublease on a monthly basis, and in fact admitted in judicio, viz:\n1) That [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of the defendant as of June, 2000, on or before June 30, 2000; and\n\n2) [[Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00, on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000.(Order dated June 27, 2000) [12] According to the MeTC, notwithstanding the evidentiary norm in civil cases that an offer of compromise is not an admission of any liability, and is not admissible in evidence against the offeror, the court cannot overlook the frank representations by Luciano Tan's counsel of the former's liability in the form of rentals, coupled with a proposal to liquidate. [13] The foregoing gestures, as appreciated by the MeTC, were akin to an admission of a fact, like the existence of a debt which can serve as proof of the loan, and was thus, admissible. [14] The court pronounced that Luciano Tan had explicitly acknowledged his liability for the periodic consideration for the use of the subleased property. Estoppel, thus, precludes him from disavowing the fact of lease implied from the tender of payment for the rentals in arrears. [15] The MeTC, explained further:\nPrescinding from the foregoing discourse, it ineluctably follows that [Luciano Tan]'s indifference to heed the two demand letters, the cognition of which were recognized (paragraphs VII and IX, Complaint; paragraph 2, Answer), rendered him a deforciant (1 Regalado , Remedial Law Compendium, 6th Revised Edition, 1997, page 770, citing Dikit vs. Ycasiano , 89 Phil. 44), and was thus vulnerable to the special civil action under Section 1, Rule 70 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, especially so when non-payment of rentals is an accepted prelude to, and a secondary matrix for, a tenant's eviction ( Article 1673 (2) , New Civil Code).\n\nFrom a different plane, [Luciano Tan]'s quest at this juncture for recovery of the rentals he paid to the plaintiff from 1987 to 1997 will not merit the desired result since, in a manner of speaking, it will place the cart ahead of the horse, when juxtaposed with another pending controversy between the parties before the Supreme Court (Annex \"1,\" Position Paper for the Defendant; Annex \"B,\" Answer to Counterclaim). The decretal portion of the Decision, states, viz:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of [Rodil Enterprises], ordering:\nDefendant Luciano Tan, and all persons claiming rights under him, to vacate the subject realty, and to peacefully deliver possession to the plaintiff's representative; Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the sum of FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PESOS (P440,000.00) as recognized unpaid rentals from September, 1997 up to June 30, 2000; Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the sum of THIRTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS (P13,750.00) as agreed rental per month, starting July, 2000, and every month thereafter, until possession is delivered to the plaintiff's representative; Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the sum of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) as reasonable attorney's fees; and Defendant [Luciano Tan] to pay the cost of suit.\nFor want of merit, defendant's counterclaim is hereby DISMISSED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [16] Aggrieved thereby, Luciano Tan appealed the Decision to the RTC. Meanwhile, Rodil Enterprises filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution, [17] which was subsequently denied by the MeTC in the Order [18] of 15 December 2000.\n\nOn 18 June 2001, the RTC rendered a Decision reversing the judgment appealed from and dismissing the Complaint. It found that the MeTC erred in holding that the offer to compromise by Luciano Tan's counsel was akin to an admission of fact, the same being contrary to Section 27, [19] Rule 130 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. As reasoned by the RTC:\nDuring the pre-trial conference held in the lower court, proposals and counter-proposals emanated from the parties' counsels, which was normally inspired by the desire to \"buy peace\", nay, to put an end to the troubles of litigation, and to promote settlement of disputes as a matter of public policy. The act of defendant/appellant's (sic) in the midst of pre-trial is not an admission of any liability and therefore, should not be considered admissible evidence against him. [20] Proceeding to the issue of the right of Rodil Enterprises to collect rentals and eject Luciano Tan based on the contracts, dated 18 May 1992 and 25 May 1992, the RTC ruled that the controversy is still pending before the Supreme Court. It, thus, held that the prayer for recovery of rentals from 1987 to 1997 is premature.\n\nThe RTC, disposed, as follows:\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the judgment appealed from is hereby REVERSED, and a new judgment is hereby entered DISMISSING the complaint in Civil Case No. 166584 for utter lack of merit. [21] Subsequently, Rodil Enterprises filed a Petition for Review with the appellate court, which, in a Decision dated 21 October 2002 set aside the judgment of the RTC, and affirmed and reinstated the 6 October 2000 Decision of the MeTC.\n\nAccording to the appellate court, there is, between Rodil Enterprises and the Republic of the Philippines, a valid and subsisting Contract of Lease executed on 18 October 1999, the same for a period of fifteen (15) years. [22] The period of the lease, under the 18 October 1999 contract is from 1 September 1997 to 31 August 2012. The Court of Appeals gave credence to the fact that the existence of the aforesaid contract was not denied nor controverted by Luciano Tan. What Luciano Tan, instead, impugned was the validity of the contracts dated 18 and 25 May 1992, which was upheld by this Court in the consolidated cases of Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, Carmen Bondoc, Teresita Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear and Chua Huay Soon (G.R. No. 129609) and Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. (G.R. No. 135537). [23]\n\nRuling on the more important question of whether Luciano Tan made a judicial admission anent his liability as a sublessee of Rodil Enterprises, the Court of Appeals held that the former made an implied admission of the existence of a contract of sublease between him and Rodil Enterprises on the subject premises; and that he had reneged in the payment of rentals since 1 September 1997. Moreover, it deemed Luciano Tan's Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals as another admission in favor of Rodil Enterprises. The appellate court elucidated, thus:\nThe evidence on record indubitably shows that respondent [Luciano Tan] is a sublessee of petitioner [Rodil Enterprises] who failed to pay rentals from 01 September 1997 and even until the case was filed before the [M]etropolitan [T]rial [C]ourt, when respondent [Luciano Tan] \"agreed in principle in open court\" to the following terms:\n\n1) that the defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September, 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of the defendant as of June, 2000, on or before June 30, 2000; and\n\n2) defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000.\nat the hearing on 27 June 2000 though no settlement was eventually reached between the parties, respondent [Luciano Tan] in effect made an implied judicial admission that there was a subsisting contract of sublease between him and petitioner, and that he was remiss in the payment of rentals from 01 September 1997 up to that day (Rollo, Annex \"9\" of petition). Respondent [Luciano Tan]'s admission was further bolstered by the fact that he filed a \"Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals\" (Rollo, p. 3 of Annex \"15\" of petition). By such acts, respondent [Luciano Tan] accepted the truth of petitioner [Rodil Enterprises'] allegation of the existence of a contract of sublease between them and of his non-payment of the rentals from 01 September 1997. A judicial admission is an admission made in the course of the proceedings in the same case, verbal or written, by a party accepting for the purposes of the suit the truth of some alleged fact, which said party cannot thereafter disprove (Remedial Law by Herrera, Oscar M. citing Section 4, Rule 129 of the Revised Rules on Evidence and Evidence by Salonga). [24] The decretal portion of the 21 October 2002 Court of Appeals' Decision, states, thus:\nWHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the petition for review is GIVEN DUE COURSE. The Decision dated 18 June 2001 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 26 is hereby SET ASIDE. The Decision dated 06 October 2000 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 13 is AFFIRMED and REINSTATED. [25] The appellate court denied Luciano Tan's Motion for Reconsideration thereon, in a Resolution, [26] dated 12 May 2005.\n\nThus, petitioner comes before us, raising the following grounds, to wit:\n\nI\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ISSUED ITS RESOLUTION DENYING PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ITS DECISION BY RELYING SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY ON THE MARCH 28, 2005 DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SAID DECISION HAS NOT YET BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.\n\nII\n\nRESPONDENT RODIL ENTERPRISES IS GUILTY OF FORUM SHOPPING WHEN IT FILED THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS DOCKETED AS CA-G.R. SP. NO. 79517 SEEKING TO NULLIFY THE ORDER OF EXECUTION BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF ITS 8 FEBRUARY 1994 DECISION IN OP CASE NO. 4968, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ITS PREVIOUS PETITION FOR REVIEW FILED WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE SAME DECISION OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DATED 8 FEBRUARY 1994 HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS IN ITS RESOLUTION DATED NOVEMBER 17, 1994 DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH PROCEDURAL RULES.\n\nIII\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS REVERSIBLE ERROR AND A GRAVE MISAPPREHENSION OF THE FACTS AND MISAPPRECIATION OF THE EVIDENCE WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER IS A SUBLESSEE OF RESPONDENT AND THAT PETITIONER WAS REMISS IN THE PAYMENT OF HIS RENTALS OVER THE PREMISES. [27] The Petition is without merit.\n\nWe shall address the first ground raised by petitioner with regard to the alleged reliance of the Court of Appeals on the Decision of the Tenth Division of the same court, dated 28 March 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 79157, entitled, Rodil Enterprises, Inc. v. The Office of the President and Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. [28]\n\nContrary to petitioner's contention, we do not find that the Court of Appeals was in error when it took notice of the ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 in resolving petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. As respondent Rodil Enterprises asseverated, for the appellate court to ignore a decision rendered by a division thereof would be to turn a blind eye on a valid judgment rendered by the same appellate body. Neither can we give merit to petitioner's submission that the reliance by the Court of Appeals on its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 is premature and misplaced. More significantly, the contention of the petitioner that the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 has not attained finality has become mute when viewed within recent factual developments. The ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 has long reached finality. This Court in a Resolution [29] dated 25 January 2006 denied the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants Association, Inc. thereon. On 20 March 2006, this Court denied with finality the Motion for Reconsideration of the 25 January 2006 Resolution for lack of compelling reason or substantial argument.[30]\n\nMoreover, on 12 April 2004, the appellate court issued a Resolution, [31] granting petitioner a hearing on its Motion for Reconsideration as the grounds cited therein needed further clarification. This belies petitioner's claim that the resolution on the Motion for Reconsideration was based solely on the ruling of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517.\n\nWe come to the second ground raised by the petitioner. Petitioner argues that Rodil Enterprises is guilty of forum shopping when it filed the Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 79157, [32] after it filed an Appeal with the appellate court in CA-G.R. SP No. 34586. [33] Forum shopping is the act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, seeking another and possibly favorable opinion in another forum other than by appeal or special civil action of certiorari . [34]\n\nThe question of forum shopping is not even material to the instant petition.\n\nIt must be emphasized that neither CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 nor CA-G.R. SP No. 34586 is before this Court for consideration. These cases are separate and distinct from CA-G.R. SP No. 67201 now before us.\n\nWhat are assailed in the instant Petition are the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated 21 October 2002 and the Resolution, dated 12 May 2005 in CA G.R. SP No. 67201, which reversed the ruling of the RTC, and affirmed the MeTC, ordering Luciano Tan to vacate the premises and peacefully deliver possession to Rodil Enterprises. The matter in controversy is the refusal of Luciano Tan to pay the monthly rentals over Botica Divisoria under the contract of sublease between the parties.\n\nOn the other hand, CA-G.R. SP No. 79157 was a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to nullify the Order of Execution of the Office of the President of its 8 February 1994 Decision in OP Case No. 4968 finding the Renewal of Contract of Lease, and the Supplemental Contract of no force and effect. CA-G.R. SP No. 34586 was an appeal on the Decision in O.P. Case No. 4968, which was the basis of the Order of Execution. If there has indeed been forum shopping when CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 was instituted during the pendency of CA-G.R. SP No. 34586, such question should have been raised by petitioner, at first instance, before the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517. It should be noted that the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 79517 was already given due course by the Court of Appeals and its ruling therein has long attained finality when, on appeal to this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 169892, we denied the said appeal with finality in our Resolutions dated 25 January 2000 and dated 20 March 2006. Whatever matters concerning the said case is now beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to resolve.\n\nWe proceed to the final ground raised by the petitioner for the allowance of the instant Petition. Petitioner assails the factual findings of the Court of Appeals when it ruled that there was a judicial admission as to petitioner's liability under a contract of sublease between him and Rodil Enterprises.\n\nTo resolve this issue, a reading of the significant orders of the MeTC and the pleadings filed by petitioner is warranted.\n\nThe MeTC issued an Order, dated 27 June 2000 of the following import, to wit:\nOn second call, the parties and counsel agreed in principle in open court to the following terms to put an end to this civil case for ejectment between them:\n\n1.) that the defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay P440,000.00 representing rentals from September, 1997 up to the present, which is the outstanding obligation of the defendant as of June, 2000 on or before June 30, 2000; and\n\n2.) the defendant [Luciano Tan] will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after June 30, 2000. [35] On 14 August 2000, petitioner filed a Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals with the MeTC, praying that he be allowed to deposit the rentals due as of August 2000, in the amount of P467,500.00, and the subsequent monthly rentals as it falls due.\n\nPetitioner posits that the aforesaid admission, made in open court, and then, reiterated in his Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals, cannot be taken as an admission of his liability, citing Section 27, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, [36] which states, inter alia , that an offer of compromise in a civil case is not a tacit admission of liability.\n\nThe general rule is an offer of compromise in a civil case is not an admission of liability. It is not admissible in evidence against the offeror.\n\nThe rule, however, is not iron-clad. This much was elucidated by this Court in Trans-Pacific Industrial Supplies, Inc. v. Court of Appeals , [37] to wit:\nTo determine the admissibility or non-admissibility of an offer to compromise, the circumstances of the case and the intent of the party making the offer should be considered. Thus, if a party denies the existence of a debt but offers to pay the same for the purpose of buying peace and avoiding litigation, the offer of settlement is inadmissible. If in the course thereof, the party making the offer admits the existence of an indebtedness combined with a proposal to settle the claim amicably, then, the admission is admissible to prove such indebtedness (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 5, p. 233 [1980 ed.]); Francisco, Rules of Court, Vol. VII, p. 325 [1973 ed.] citing McNiel v. Holbrook, 12 Pac. (US) 84, 9 L. ed., 1009). Indeed, an offer of settlement is an effective admission of a borrower's loan balance (L.M. Handicraft Manufacturing Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 186 SCRA 640 [1990]. x x x. [38] Similarly, in the case of Varadero de Manila v. Insular Lumber Co. [39] the Court applied the exception to the general rule. In Varadero ' there was neither an expressed nor implied denial of liability, but during the course of the abortive negotiations therein, the defendant expressed a willingness to pay the plaintiff. Finding that there was no denial of liability, and considering that the only question discussed was the amount to be paid, the Court did not apply the rule of exclusion of compromise negotiations.\n\nIn the case at bar, the MeTC and the Court of Appeals properly appreciated petitioner's admission as an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility. The MeTC found that petitioner did not contest the existence of the sublease, and his counsel made frank representations anent the former's liability in the form of rentals. This expressed admission was coupled with a proposal to liquidate. The Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals was deemed by the MeTC as an explicit acknowledgment of petitioner's liability on the subleased premises. The Court of Appeals agreed with the MeTC. Indeed, the existence of the Contract of Lease, dated 18 October 1999 was not denied by petitioner. The contracts that were assailed by petitioner are the contracts dated 18 and 25 May 1992, the validity of which has been upheld by this Court in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 129609 and G.R. No. 135537.\n\nFinally, we find a categorical admission on the part of petitioner, not only as to his liability, but also, as to the amount of indebtedness in the form of rentals due. The Order of the MeTC dated 27 June 2000 was clear that the petitioner agreed in open court to pay the amount of P440,000.00, representing petitioner's unpaid rentals from September 1997 to June 2000; and that petitioner will pay the monthly rentals computed at P13,750.00 on or before the 5th day of each month after 30 June 2000. The petitioner's judicial admission in open court, as found by the MeTC, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals finds particular significance when viewed together with his Motion to Allow Defendant to Deposit Rentals, wherein petitioner stated that the rentals due on the premises in question from September 1997 up to the present amounted to P467,500.00, as of the date of filing the Motion. Petitioner cannot now be allowed to reject the same. An admission made in the pleading cannot be controverted by the party making such admission and are conclusive as to him, and that all proofs submitted by him contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith should be ignored whether objection is interposed by a party or not. [40] A judicial admission is an admission made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, for purposes of the truth of some alleged fact, which said party cannot thereafter disprove. [41]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Petition is DENIED . The Decision dated 21 October 2002 and the Resolution dated 12 May 2005 in CA-G.R.

In the absence of a contract, he shall deposit with the Regional Trial Court the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises for the preceding month or period at the rate determined by the judgment of the lower court on or before the tenth day of each succeeding month or period. The supersedeas bond shall be transmitted by the Municipal Trial Court, with the other papers, to the clerk of the Regional Trial Court to which the action is appealed.\n\nAll amounts so paid to the appellate court shall be deposited with said court or authorized government depositary bank, and shall be held there until the final disposition of the appeal, unless the court, by agreement of the interested parties, or in the absence of reasonable grounds of opposition to a motion to withdraw, or for justifiable reasons, shall decree otherwise. Should the defendant fail to make the payments above prescribed from time to time during the pendency of the appeal, the appellate court, upon motion of the plaintiff, and upon proof of such failure, shall order the execution of the judgment appealed from with respect to the restoration of possession, but such execution shall not be a bar to the appeal taking its course until the final disposition thereof on the merits.\n\nAfter the case is decided by the Regional Trial Court, any money paid to the court by the defendant for purposes of the stay of execution shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the judgment of the Regional Trial Court.

JOSE ALVIZO AUDINE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nBefore Us for review is the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00338 which affirmed with modification the Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Marikina City, Branch 272, finding accused-appellant Jose Alvizo Audine guilty of two (2) counts of rape committed against his fourteen-year old daughter, AAA [3] and sentencing him to suffer the capital punishment for each count.\n\nOn the basis of the complaint filed by AAA, two informations for Rape [4] against accused-appellant were filed with the RTC of Marikina City. The accusatory portions thereof read:\nCriminal Case No. 2001-4093-MK\n\nThat on or about the 24 th day of December 1999, in the City of Marikina, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the minor victim, by means of force, coercion and intimidation, with the use of small knife which is a bladed weapon, and with lewd design or intent to cause or gratify his sexual desire upon complainant AAA, a minor and fifteen (15) years old, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said complainant against her will and consent which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of said child as a human being. [5]\n\nCriminal Case No. 2001-4094-MK\n\nThat on or about the 8 th day of January 2000, in the City of Marikina, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the minor victim, by means of force, coercion and intimidation, with the use of a small knife which is a bladed weapon, and with lewd design or intent to cause or gratify his sexual desire upon complainant AAA, a minor and fifteen (15) years old, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said complainant against her will and consent which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of said child as a human being. [6]\nThe cases were raffled to Branch 272. Finding probable cause, a warrant of arrest was issued against accused-appellant who was arrested and detained at the Marikina City Police Station.\n\nWhen arraigned on 10 June 2002, accused-appellant, with the assistance of counsel de oficio , pleaded \"not guilty\" to the two counts of rape. [7] Thereafter, the cases were consolidated and jointly tried.\n\nDuring the pre-trial, the following stipulation of facts [8] was entered into by the prosecution and the defense:\nThe jurisdiction of this court to try these cases;\n\nThe identity of the accused as AAA; [9]\n\nThe existence and due execution of Medico Legal Report No. M-187-01 issued and prepared by Dr. Ruby Grace D. Sabino dated January 17, 2001;\n\nThe existence of the medico legal examination issued and prepared by Dr. Ruby Grace D. Sabino addressed to the PNP Crime Laboratory;\n\nThe existence and due execution of the initial of the Medico Legal Report No. M-187-01 dated January 16, 2001; and\n\nThe existence of the manifestation of consent signed by the victim and the Department of Social Welfare and Development who is the guardian of the victim. The prosecution presented four witnesses, namely: private complainant AAA, Dr. Ruby Grace D. Sabino, SPO4 Nenita Sadullo Abanes and Lucila Sulte Arresu. For the defense, only accused-appellant took the stand.\n\nThe records bear the following:\nIt appears from the evidence adduced by the prosecution that AAA, the only daughter of the accused-appellant, was born on August 4, 1985.\n\nOn November 7, 1999, the accused-appellant was supposed to bring AAA to the house of his wife's cousin in Bulacan. Instead, he brought her to the house of his own cousin, Arminda Arginosa, at XXX, XXX City.\n\nOn December 24, 1999, AAA was alone reading magazines in the house of her aunt when the accused-appellant arrived and ordered her to get his clothes from the master's bedroom. AAA did as told. But the accused-appellant almost at once followed AAA inside the room and pushed her towards the bed. She fought back but the accused-appellant boxed her in the abdomen. The accused-appellant then forcibly took off AAA's dress and shorts. AAA continued resisting the accused-appellant and pleaded with him to stop, but to no avail. The accused-appellant kissed AAA's body, laid on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina, satiating his lust. After the violation, the accused-appellant warned AAA not to tell anybody about the rape. AAA feared for her life because the accused-appellant pointed a knife at her before and after the rape incident.\n\nThe second violation occurred on January 8, 2000. AAA was sleeping alone in her room when she felt something pressing on her thigh. It was again the accused-appellant, a knife pointed at her abdomen, who was undressing her. It was the same knife the accused-appellant used during the December 24, 1999 incident. AAA shouted and fought back, but as in the first incident, the accused-appellant again boxed her in the stomach. The accused-appellant masturbated first before inserting his male member into AAA's vagina. At the conclusion of the bestial assault, he threatened to kill AAA and her siblings if she reported the rape to anybody. After the incident, the accused-appellant left for Quezon Province.\n\nAs a result of her successive violations, AAA got pregnant. On August 19, 2000, she gave birth to a baby boy, who however died five (5) days later.\n\nSince she was in virtual isolation, AAA went to see medical social worker Lucila Arresu and revealed to the latter that the accused-appellant had raped her. Armed with that information, Lucila called up the Marikina City Police. SPO4 Nenita Abanes interviewed AAA and took down her statement.\n\nOn January 16, 2001, Dr. Ruby Grace Sabino conducted a physical examination on AAA. She found the condition of AAA's genitalia exhibiting signs of penetration. According to her, AAA's hymen has \"carunculae myrtiformis\" or, in layman's term, there is already a rose bead appearance on it, which is an indication that AAA has already given birth.\n\nInterposing disavowal or alibi, the accused-appellant simply denied the charges against him. He claimed that on December 24, 1999 and January 8, 2000, he was in Sariaya, Quezon working in his tailoring shop.\n\nHe further testified that in September 1999, AAA was missing for three (3) days. His family searched for her and learnt that she had eloped with her sweetheart BBB.\n\nHe claimed that it was not his idea to take AAA anywhere, since she was still studying in Quezon Province. It was AAA's mother who prevailed upon him to bring their daughter to XXX City to prevent AAA from seeing her friends, who had badly influenced her, as well as her boyfriend, with whom she later eloped. [10]\nOn 5 December 2002, the trial court, convicting accused-appellant of two counts of rape and imposing on him the death penalty for each count, disposed of the cases as follows:\nWHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the accused, JOSE ALVIZO AUDINE, is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Rape (RA 8353) filed against him and is sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of DEATH in each case. The accused is further ordered to indemnify the private complaint in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (PhP100,000.00) and FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (PhP50,000.00) as moral damages so as to serve as deterrent to this disturbing trend, plus the costs of the suit. [11]\nIgnoring accused-appellant's defenses, the trial court ratiocinated:\nThe accused interposed a number of defenses. First, that of alibi. Jose Audine stated that the December 24, 1999 and January 8, 2000 alleged rape incidents could not be true as he was already in Sariaya, Quezon then, having returned to the province right after taking AAA to her cousin Arminda Arganosa's house in XXX. Second, the accused denied having raped her daughter and stressed that her daughter had ran away with her boyfriend, BBB, in Sariaya, Quezon on September of 1999 giving an implication that the pregnancy could be attributed to that. He only wanted to stop AAA from seeing her \"womanizer-cum-addict\" boyfriend, BBB. He corroborated AAA's testimony that he filed a rape case in Sariaya, Quezon against BBB.\n\nHowever, realizing the futility of his defense, the accused shifted his defense in the middle of the trial. According to the accused, his cousin Arminda Arganosa was arrested for illegal possession of a big amount of shabu in Dalampasigan Beach in Dalahican, Sariaya, Quezon, and Arminda suspected that he was behind her arrest. He also accused Arminda of acting as a \"pimp\" to her daughter as she vowed to get even with Jose Audine, an allegation too incredible to believe considering AAA's pregnancy was very noticeable then. In People vs. Balgos, 323 SCRA 372, it was held that an \"accused's shift of theory, upon realizing the futility of his earlier defense, rather than help his cause, only further damaged his credibility.\" [12]\nConsidering that the penalty it imposed was the death penalty, the trial court forwarded the records of the case to the Supreme Court for automatic review pursuant to Section 10, Rule 122 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure. [13] However, pursuant to our ruling in People v. Mateo , [14] the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition.\n\nOn 18 February 2005, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision affirming the conviction of accused-appellant, together with the imposition of the death penalty for each count of rape, but modified the awards of civil indemnity and damages. The dispositive portion thereof reads:\nUPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS, the appealed Decision dated December 5, 2002 of the Regional Trial Court of Marikina City, Branch 272, in Criminal Cases Nos. 2001-4093-MK and 2001-4094-MK, finding the accused-appellant JOSE ALVIZO AUDINE guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape and sentencing him in each case to suffer the penalty of death is AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that for each count of rape, the accused-appellant is also CONDEMNED to pay the private complainant, AAA, the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nShould no motion for reconsideration be filed in this case by the accused-appellant within the allowable reglementary period, or after the lapse thereof, let the entire records of this case be forwarded to the Honorable Supreme Court for appropriate action hereon. [15]\nOn 15 March 2005, accused-appellant filed a motion for reconsideration [16] of the decision but same was denied by the Court of Appeals on 28 June 2005. [17] In accordance with Section 13, paragraph 2 of Rule 124, the entire records of the case were elevated to the Supreme Court for review. Thereupon, the parties were required to submit supplemental briefs within thirty (30) days from notice. [18] Accused-appellant opted not to file a supplemental brief on the ground he had exhaustively argued all the relevant issues in his appellant's brief. On the part of the Office of the Solicitor General, despite notice, no response was received therefrom.\n\nAccused-appellant makes a lone assignment of error:\nTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. [19]\nIn trying to discredit private complainant AAA, accused-appellant cites several circumstances that tend to create doubt as to his guilt, to wit: (1) It is quite unimaginable how the accused-appellant could still manage to undress AAA while he was holding her hands and at the same time pointing a knife at her who was then putting up a fight; (2) It is unbelievable that accused-appellant could have penetrated her considering that she was kicking him while he was inserting his penis into her vagina; (3) The failure of AAA to exercise any precaution in securing herself, like locking her room or arming herself with a weapon, to prevent accused-appellant's sexual advances considering her alleged horrible experience with accused-appellant; (4) The delay in reporting the incidents notwithstanding the absence of the accused-appellant who was in the province all the time, renders doubtful her charges of rape; (5) The charges of rape were filed by AAA as revenge against accused-appellant whom she considered as the person who separated her from her lover; (6) AAA's admission that she executed a sworn statement charging BBB with rape which she later recanted, indicates that she can concoct untruthful stories under oath.\n\nIn the review of rape cases, we are almost invariably guided by the following principles: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. [20]\n\nAccused-appellant's contention that he could not have committed the rapes the way private complainant described them deserves scant consideration. We fully agree with the Court of Appeals when it ruled:\nAAA never testified that the accused-appellant undressed her, while he was holding her hands and pointing a knife at her, as the accused-appellant seems to suggest. A plain reading of AAA's testimony during her direct examination shows that such acts of the accused-appellant were done at different points in time.\n\nWe also fail to see anything extraordinary or unbelievable in AAA's testimony that despite her act of kicking the accused-appellant he still succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina. While it may be admitted that AAA's act of kicking made penetration somewhat difficult, it certainly did not render the satyr's maniacal attack irresistible, nor his penetration into the citadel of his daughter's purity anything impossible. [21]\nPrivate complainant is being faulted for not taking the necessary measures to prevent a recurrence of her horrible experience with accused-appellant last 24 December 1999. Her failure to perform what accused-appellant claims she ought to have done cannot be taken against her. A fourteen-year old girl cannot be reasonably expected to exercise or put into place any measure that would avert the repetition of the ordeal with her father. How the victim comported herself after the incident was not significant as it had nothing to do with the elements of the crime of rape. [22] Not all victims can be expected to act conformably to the usual expectations of everyone. Different and varying degrees of behavioral responses are expected in the proximity of, or in confronting, an aberrant episode. It is settled that different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. [23] The workings of the human mind when placed under emotional stress are unpredictable. [24] This Court, in People v. Luzorata , [25] held:\nThis Court indeed has not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave immediately after she has been abused. This experience is relative and may be dealt with in any way by the victim depending on the circumstances, but her credibility should not be tainted with any modicum of doubt x x x.\nPrivate complainant narrated in a clear and straightforward manner her harrowing experience. The trial court and the Court of Appeals gave credence to her testimony. She recounted her ordeal as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nPROS.

[26]\nAfter a review of the testimony of the private complainant, We find no compelling reason to reverse the findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals. When it comes to credibility, the trial court's assessment deserves great weight, and is even conclusive and binding, if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence. The reason is obvious. Having the full opportunity to observe directly the witnesses' deportment and manner of testifying, the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to evaluate properly testimonial evidence. [27] In the case at bar, there being overwhelming evidence showing that on 24 December 1999 and 8 January 2000 appellant had carnal knowledge of private complainant by means of force, coercion and intimidation, we have no reason not to apply the rule and to apply the exception.\n\nAccused-appellant interposed the defense of denial and alibi. No jurisprudence in criminal law is more settled than that alibi is the weakest of all defenses for it is easy to contrive and difficult to disprove, and for which reason it is generally rejected. [28] For the defense of alibi to prosper, it is imperative that the accused establish two elements: (1) he was not at the locus delicti at the time the offense was committed; and (2) it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene at the time of its commission. [29]\n\nIn the case at bar, accused-appellant claimed that on 24 December 1999 and 8 January 2000, he was in Sariaya, Quezon working in his tailoring shop. He, however, did not present any witness to corroborate such claim. Unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, his alibi is self-serving and deserves no weight in law; thus, same must necessarily fail. An alibi must be supported by credible corroboration from disinterested witnesses, and where such defense is not corroborated, it is fatal to the accused. [30] Uncorroborated alibi must be disregarded. [31]\n\nAccused-appellant further argues that the delay in reporting the incidents renders doubtful private complainant's charges of rape.\n\nWe are not persuaded. The delay and initial reluctance of a rape victim to make public the assault on her virtue is neither unknown nor uncommon. Particularly in incestuous rape, this Court has consistently held that delay in reporting the offense is not indicative of a fabricated charge. [32] It has been repeatedly held that the delay in reporting a rape incident due to death threats cannot be taken against the victim. [33] The charge of rape is rendered doubtful only if the delay was unreasonable and unexplained. In this case, private complainant, who was fourteen years old when she was ravished, satisfactorily explained why she did not immediately report the matter to anybody. She revealed that she is afraid of her father and that the latter threatened to kill her and her siblings if she would divulge the sexual attack on her. [34] Accused-appellant, being her father, exercises moral ascendancy and influence over her. Thus, her reluctance that caused the delay should not be taken against her. Neither can it be used to diminish her credibility nor undermine the charge of rape.\n\nThe fact of delay does not necessarily lead to an acquittal. In several cases we have decided, [35] the delay lasted for two years or more; nevertheless, the victims were found to be credible. As above-mentioned, we found the delay to be reasonable and sufficiently explained. The testimony of the victim herself has convinced the Court that her accusation has a ring of truth sufficient to justify the conviction of appellant.\n\nThe defense tried to impute ill motive on private complainant claiming that the latter filed the two cases of rape to exact revenge because he separated private complainant from her lover-boyfriend.\n\nWe find this hard to believe. Motives such as feuds, resentment and revenge have never swayed us from giving full credence to the testimony of a minor complainant. [36] This Court has held time and again that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature deserve full credence, considering that no young woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subject to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her. [37] It is highly improbable that a girl of tender years, one not yet exposed to the ways of the world, would impute to any man a crime so serious as rape if what she claims is not true. [38] Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth. [39] Full weight and credit should, indeed, be accorded AAA's testimony. It is very unlikely for her to accuse her father of so heinous a crime if it were not true. Her credibility was bolstered beyond reproach by her spontaneous emotional breakdown during trial. [40]\n\nSo traumatized by her horrific experience with her father, private complainant testified that, in the event her father is found guilty, she will not regret or repent if he is sentenced to death because she only wants justice for what he did to her. [41] Furthermore, her refusal to reveal in the Birth Certificate the name of the father of her child indicates that it was accused-appellant who sired her son. She testified:\nATTY. LARRACAS:\n\nQ. You did not indicate the name of your father as the father of your child?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. Why did you not place the name of your father?\n\nA. Because his name if I would place the name of my father it will be shameful and embarrassing if they find out that the father of my child is my father, ma'am. [42]\nA child of tender years will not make these declarations unless the bestial attacks on her were not truly perpetrated by her father.\n\nThe contention of the defense that private complainant cannot be considered a credible witness because she has the propensity to concoct untruthful stories under oath in light of her admission that she executed a sworn statement charging BBB with the crime of rape which she later recanted, deserves scant consideration.\n\nPrivate complainant explained to the satisfaction of this Court that she was merely forced by her father to execute a sworn statement against BBB that the latter raped her. [43] It is very apparent that she was under her father's moral authority and influence. This ascendancy, together with the threats from her father, is so great that private complainant failed to resist or overcome it.\n\nThe pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal Code relative to the case on hand are Articles 266-A and 266-B, which read:\nArt. 266-A. Rape; When and How Committed. \u2013 Rape is committed \u2013\n\n1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:\n\na) Through force, threat, or intimidation;\n\nx x x x\n\nArt. 266-B. Penalties. \u2013\n\nx x x x\n\nThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:\n\n1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.\nFor one to be convicted of qualified rape, at least one of the aggravating/qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code must be alleged in the information and duly proved during the trial. [44] In the instant case, since the special qualifying circumstances of the victim's minority and her relationship with the offender have been properly alleged in the informations and established during trial, the imposition of the death penalty for each count of rape is justified.\n\nWith the effectivity, [45] however, of Republic Act No. 9346 entitled, \"An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines,\" the imposition of the supreme penalty of death has been prohibited. Pursuant to Section 2 thereof, the penalty to be meted on accused-appellant shall be reclusion perpetua . Said section reads:\nSECTION 2. In lieu of the death penalty, the following shall be imposed:\n\n(a) the penalty of reclusion perpetua , when the law violated makes use of the nomenclature of the penalties of the Revised Penal Code; or\n\n(b) the penalty of life imprisonment, when the law violated does not make use of the nomenclature of the penalties of the Revised Penal Code.\nNotwithstanding the reduction of the penalty imposed on accused-appellant, he is not eligible for parole following Section 3 of said law which provides:\nSECTION 3. Persons convicted of offenses punished with reclusion perpetua , or whose sentences will be reduced to reclusion perpetua , by reason of this Act, shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, as amended.\nAs regards the award of damages for each count of rape, the same must be modified. The P100,000.00 awarded by the trial court as civil indemnity [46] was properly reduced by the Court of Appeals to P75,000.00 which is the amount awarded if the crime is qualified by circumstances which warrant the imposition of the death penalty. [47] With respect to moral damages, the amount of P50,000.00 awarded by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals must be increased to P75,000.00 without need of pleading or proof of basis thereof. [48] Moreover, the P25,000.00 awarded by the Court of Appeals as exemplary damages was proper due to the presence of the qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship. [49]\n\nWHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 18 February 2005 finding accused-appellant Jose Alvizo Audine guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of qualified rape is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that each penalty of death imposed on appellant is reduced to reclusion perpetua without eligibility to parole pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346. He is also ordered to pay private complainant AAA, for each count of rape, the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.

No. 9165 in two (2) Informations that read:\nCRIMINAL CASE No. 02-3038\n\nThat on or about the 18 th of October 2002, in the City of Makati, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without the corresponding license or prescription, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, give away, distribute and transport Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu), a regulated drug, weighing ZERO POINT ZERO THREE GRAM (0.03 gram) contained in one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [1]\n\nCRIMINAL CASE NO. 02-3039\n\nThat on or about the 18 th day of October 2002, in the City of Makati, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being lawfully authorized to possess or otherwise use any dangerous drug and wihtout corresponding license or prescription, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, direct custody and control zero point zero three (0.03) gram of Methylamphetamine hyrochloride (shabu), which is a dangerous drug in violation of the above cited law.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [2]\nUpon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges. [3] Trial ensued. After trial, his co-accused Susan Pugal was acquitted from a separate charge for violation of Section 11, Article II, R.A. No. 9165. However, in a Decision [4] dated 8 September 2003, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. The RTC disposed as follows:\nWHEREFORE, it appearing that the guilt of the accused ROMEO DEL MUNDO y STA. MARIA was proven beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. [No.] 9165, as principal, with no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, accused is hereby sentenced:\nIn Criminal Case No. 02-3038, to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00;\n\nIn Criminal Case No. 02-3039, to suffer imprisonment for a period of twelve [12] years and one [1] day, as minimum, to twenty [20] years and a fine of P300,000.00; and\n\nTo pay the costs. It appearing that the guilt of accused SUSAN PUGAL y PINGOL in Criminal Case No. 02-3040 was not proven beyond reasonable doubt, she is hereby acquitted of the crime of violation of Section 11 of RA [No.] 9165.\n\nLet the zero point zero nine [0.09] gram of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride be turned over to the PDEA for proper disposition.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5]\nCulled from the records and decisions of the courts below, the antecedents follow.\n\nThe office of Cluster 2 of the Makati Anti-Drug Abuse Council (MADAC) received a report from a confidential informant that a certain Romy, later identified as appellant, was engaged in the selling of prohibited drugs, particularly shabu . Proceeding from this information, the head of MADAC Cluster 2 formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation and designated MADAC agent Norman A. Bilason (Bilason) as the poseur-buyer, to be provided with two (2) marked P100 bills. [6] [7]\n\nOn 18 October 2002, at around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, the informant accompanied Bilason to the place where appellant was reported to be plying his trade. Meantime, the rest of the MADAC and Drug Enforcement Unit (DEU) operatives positioned themselves at a strategic place to monitor the transaction. [8]\n\nBilason and the informant approached appellant who was then standing at the corner of Pasong Tirad and Ponte Streets in Tejeros, Makati and talking to his female companion, later identified as Pugal and allegedly a \"scorer\" according to the informant. The informant introduced Bilason to appellant as a buyer of shabu . Appellant asked Bilason how much he intended to buy. Bilason replied, \" Dos lang, panggamit lang. \" Then, appellant received the P200.00 marked money from Bilason while handing the latter one (1) plastic sachet [9] of shabu which came from the left pocket of his pants. Next, Bilason gave the pre-arranged signal. The rest of the team closed in. Bilason introduced himself as a member of MADAC and, with the team, placed appellant and Pugal under arrest. Two (2) plastic sachets [10] and the marked money were recovered from appellant while one (1) plastic sachet [11] was confiscated from Pugal. Appellant and Pugal were duly apprised of the nature of their arrest and their constitutional rights. [12]\n\nAfterwards, appellant and Pugal were brought to the DEU office for proper disposition. Tests conducted on the plastic sachet yielded positive results for Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride. [13]\n\nThe parties stipulated that the physical science report [14] was duly accomplished after the specimens of shabu had been subjected to laboratory tests. Hence, the prosecution dispensed with the presentation of the Forensic Chemist. The parties likewise stipulated that: (1) MADAC agent Diomedes Camporaso confiscated from Pugal one [1] plastic sachet suspected to contain shabu ; and (2) SPO2 Wilmer Antonio was the team leader of the buy-bust operation wherein he assisted in the arrest of appellant. [15]\n\nAppellant, a 63-year old jobless resident of Tejeros, Makati, interposed the defense of denial. He claimed that there was never a time in his life that he sold shabu . He alleged that in the afternoon of 18 October 2002, he was inside his house lying down with his grandchild. He was awakened from sleep when police officers kicked the door open and entered the house. The police officers forced him to reveal the whereabouts of the shabu and the money. Appellant replied that he does not sell shabu . Then, the police officers searched the house but were not able to find anything. Subsequently, appellant was asked to go out of the house and board the police officers' service vehicle for allegedly selling shabu . Appellant entrusted his grandchild to his wife's sibling. [16]\n\nAt the DEU office, appellant was told to escape but he did not as he claimed not to have done anything wrong. Ten (10) minutes after, Pugal arrived. Appellant came to know of the charges against him on the day he was arrested. Allegedly, these are false charges but appellant failed to file any complaint against the arresting officer for lack of money. [17]\n\nAppellant was found guilty as charged and the judgment of conviction was elevated to the Court for automatic review. In a Resolution [18] dated 6 September 2004 of the Court in G.R. Nos. 159854-56, [19] the cases were transferred to the Court of Appeals pursuant to the Court's ruling in People v. Mateo . [20]\n\nBefore the Court of Appeals, appellant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) according greater weight to the evidence adduced by the prosecution and disregarding the defense of denial interposed by appellant; and (2) finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offenses charged. [21]\n\nThe Court of Appeals in a Decision [22] dated 27 June 2005, in CA-G.R. CR No. 00232, affirmed with modifications the decision of the trial court. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , the appealed Decision is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Appellant Romeo del Mundo y Sta. Maria is hereby ACQUITTED in Crim. Case No. 02-3039 . His conviction in Crim. Case No. 02-3038 for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA No. 9165 and all other aspects of the Decision are maintained.\n\nSO ORDERED. [23]\nThe Court of Appeals held that in Criminal Case No. 02-3038, the details of the sale of shabu between appellant and the MADAC operatives have been clearly and sufficiently shown. [24] However, the appellate court entertained doubts with respect to appellant's culpability in Criminal Case No. 02-3039 resulting to his acquittal therein. The appellate court observed that the prosecution did not produce evidence to show that appellant was actually in possession of the second sachet supposedly containing 'shabu.' [25]\n\nAppellant is now before the Court submitting for resolution the same matters argued before the Court of Appeals, though this time he questions only his conviction in Criminal Case No. 02-3038, for the illegal sale of shabu , as he was acquitted of the charge in Criminal Case No. 02-3039 by the appellate court. Through his Manifestation (In Lieu of Supplemental Brief) [26] dated 14 November 2005, appellant stated that will not file a Supplemental Brief and in lieu thereof, he will adopt the Appellant's Brief he had filed before the appellate court. The Office of the Solicitor General likewise manifested that it is no longer filing a supplemental brief. [27]\n\nAppellant principally contends that the non-presentation before the trial court of the informant and witnesses other than MADAC agents Bilason and Camporaso militates against the trustworthiness of the prosecution's theory. [28]\n\nThe Court is not persuaded.\n\nThe pertinent provision of Article II of R.A. 9165 [29] reads as follows:\nSEC. 5. Sale, Trading, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals. - The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.000) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.\nThe elements necessary in every prosecution for the illegal sale of 'shabu' are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. [30] What is material is the proof that the transaction or sale transpired, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti . Corpus delicti is the body or substance of the crime, and establishes the fact that a crime has been actually committed. It has two elements, namely: (1) proof of the occurrence of a certain event; and (2) some person's criminal responsibility for the act. [31]\n\nMADAC agent Bilason, the poseur-buyer, clearly established that an illegal sale of shabu actually took place and that appellant was the author thereof. He testified as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFiscal Moreno to witness:\n | \nQ: | How did you come to know the accused in this case?\nA: | On October 18, 2002, we arrested both accused Romeo del Mundo and Susan Pugal.\n | \nQ: | For what particular offense?\nA: | For violation of Sections 5 and 11.\n | \nQ: | Did you conduct a buy-bust operation against said accused?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | Was the buy bust operation successful?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | In connection with the buy-bust operation that you conducted against the accused, do you recall having executed a Joint Affidavit of Arrest?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | If that affidavit will be shown to you, will you be able to identify the same?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | I am showing to you a Pinagsanib Na Sinumpaang Salaysay.

Quiambao:\n\nWe agree, your Honor.\n\nx x x x [32]\nIn the Pinagsanib na Sinumpaang Salaysay , [33] Bilason together with SPO2 Wilmer Antonio and MADAC Agent Camporaso narrated in detail the sale of shabu made by appellant to Bilason. Based on a tip from a confidential informant, a team composed of MADAC and DEU agents was formed to conduct a buy-bust operation. The team proceeded to the place wherein, according to the confidential informant, appellant allegedly conducted his transactions. After introductions were made, Bilason handed the marked money to appellant while the latter in turn handed him one (1) plastic sachet containing shabu . Appellant was thereafter immediately arrested. [34]\n\nThe result of the laboratory examination conducted on the white crystalline substance confiscated from appellant and forwarded to the crime laboratory of the Philippine National Police confirms the testimony that indeed, what was sold by appellant was shabu . The results of the examination states:\nFINDINGS:\n\nQualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimens gave POSITIVE result to the tests for the presence of Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drugs. x x x x\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nSpecimens A to C contains Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drugs. x x x x [35]\nMoreover, Bilason was able to present and identify in court the confiscated drugs and the marked money, which are corroborating pieces of evidence of the corpus delicti , thus:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFiscal Moreno to witness:\n | \nQ: | You likewise stated in your Affidavit that you were able to buy shabu from the accused and confiscated another plastic sachets (sic) containing shabu.

If that two pieces of One Hundred Peso bills will be shown to you, will you be able to identify the same? A: Yes, sir.\n\nI am showing to you two pieces of One Hundred Peso bills, will you please tell us if these are the same buy bust money which you used in conducting the buy bust operation against the accused?\nA: This is the photocopy of the buy bust money we used in the operation.\n\nx x x x [37] A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment whereby ways and means are resorted to for the purpose of trapping and capturing the lawbreakers in the execution of their criminal plan. [38] The delivery of the contraband to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money successfully consummates the buy-bust transaction between the entrapping officers and the accused. [39] Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired by any improper motive or were not properly performing their duty, their testimony on the operation deserves full faith and credit. [40]\n\nIt is very clear from the testimony of Bilason and the other members of the team bear that their narration of events was positive, probable and in accord with human experience. It bears the badges of truth, such that it is difficult for a rational mind not to find it credible. Thus, we find no reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court and the appellate court.\n\nIn addition, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties has not been controverted; hence, the Court is bound to uphold it. Appellant failed to prove that in testifying against him, Bilason and the other members of the team were motivated by reasons other than the duty to curb the sale of dangerous drugs. There is no proof of any ill motive or odious intent on the part of the police authorities to impute falsely such a serious crime to appellant. [41]\n\nOn the non-presentation of the informant, the rule is that his presentation in an illegal drugs case is not essential for the conviction nor is it indispensable for a successful prosecution because his testimony would merely be corroborative and cumulative. Informants are generally not presented in court because of the need to hide their identity and preserve their invaluable service to the police. Here, the agents directly testified regarding the entrapment, and the testimony of the informant would merely have been corroborative.\n\nAppellant's defenses of denial and alibi are unavailing. It bears emphasis that appellant was caught in flagrante delicto in a legitimate entrapment operation conducted by the MADAC and DEU agents. Hence, his identity as the person who sold the dangerous drug to Bilason cannot be doubted anymore. Such positive identification prevails over his weak defenses of denial and alibi.\n\nIn People v. Isnani , [42] we ruled that:\nThe defenses of denial and alibi have been invariably viewed by us with disfavor for it can easily be concocted but difficult to prove, and they are common and standard defense ploys in most prosecutions arising from violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act. [43]\nAppellant's contention that the police authorities intruded his house and that he only failed to file charges against them due to lack of money could neither be believed. Appellant did not bother to present any evidence to support this contention. It likewise bears stressing that the police authorities are presumed to have performed their duty in a regular manner. [44]\n\nIn fine, the trial court and the appellate court correctly held that appellant is guilty of the crime of illegal sale of shabu. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision dated 27 June 2005 of the Eighth Division of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R.

ZOSIMO AGUILA Y ATIENZA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nFor review is the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 01077, dated 18 July 2005, [1] affirming the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lipa City, Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 12, in Criminal Case No. 0451-2000, dated 22 July 2002, [2] convicting the accused-appellant Zosimo Aguila y Atienza, of the crime of murder, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua , and ordering him to pay the heirs of deceased Conrado V. Enriquez (Conrado), the amount of P39,690.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.\n\nOn 5 September 2000, appellant was indicted in an Information [3] for Murder allegedly committed as follows:\nThat on or about the 3 rd day of September, 2000 at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, at Barangay Bulacnin, Lipa City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, then armed with a piece of wood, with intent to kill and without any justifiable cause, with treachery and evident pre-meditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and club with the use of said piece of wood suddenly and without warning, one Conrado Enriquez y Villapando, thereby inflicting upon the latter multiple head injuries which directly caused his death.\nWhen arraigned on 20 September 2000, appellant pleaded \"Not Guilty\" to the charge therein. [4] Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.\n\nThe prosecution presented its case through the testimonies of its witnesses, namely: Simplicio Manalo, Donald Enriquez, Ronilo Bautista, SPO1 Marcelino Ligarte and Dr. Corazon Sabile. Their testimonies are summarized as follows:\n\nSimplicio Manalo (Simplicio) is a farmer and resident of Barangay Bagong Pook, Rosario, Batangas. He testified that he knew the victim, Conrado, because they were good friends for a long time, and, that both of them were engaged in the selling of fighting cocks/roosters. He narrated that on 3 September 2000, at about 2:00 in the afternoon, he went to the house of Conrado at Barangay Bulacnin, Lipa City, as the latter wanted to show him his new set of fighting cocks/roosters. Both of them had merienda and drank a bottle of gin while conversing. They were not able to consume the bottle of gin because he refused to drink anymore. Thereafter, Conrado invited him to the birthday party of his cousin's child which was being held in a house near a waiting shed of the same barangay. [5]\n\nWhen he and Conrado arrived at the birthday party, they joined the other visitors in a drinking spree. He, however, drank only a small amount of gin. Conrado, then, introduced him to his brother-in-law, Zosimo Aguila (Aguila) herein appellant, and to his \" bilas \" Ronilo Bautista (Ronilo) who were also drinking thereat. During the drinking session, he saw and heard Conrado and appellant arguing about a borrowed hoe. [6]\n\nAt about 8:00 in the evening, he told Conrado that he was leaving. Conrado accompanied him to a nearby lighted waiting shed for a ride home. While waiting for a jeepney, he noticed that Conrado laid down on the bench of the waiting shed and fell asleep. Later, he saw appellant and Ronilo walking and heading to the waiting shed. Upon arriving thereat, the two approached the sleeping Conrado. He advised them not to wake up or disturb Conrado as the latter was heavily drunk. Appellant and Ronilo, however, told him that they would bring Conrado home. When Conrado woke up, the two carried him by putting his arms around their shoulders and walked towards the direction of a vacant lot near the waiting shed. [7]\n\nMinutes later, he heard \"cracking\" sounds and shouts of \" huwag \" coming from the direction of the vacant lot. He glanced at the vacant lot and saw two persons, one was assaulting Conrado while the other was holding on to Conrado. He identified the two as the appellant and Ronilo. Frightened, he left the place and took a ride home. It was only after the lapse of one month that he learned of Conrado's death. Fearing for his own safety, he did not divulge to the family of Conrado what he knew about Conrado's death. When the family of Conrado, however, learned that he witnessed the incident, they went to his house and begged him several times to help in resolving the case. Out of pity for Conrado's family, he agreed to testify in court and gave his sworn statement before the police authorities. [8]\n\nDonald Enriquez (Donald) is the younger brother of Conrado. He testified that on the evening of 3 September 2000, he went to the house of his cousin, Kuya Pitong Martija, to attend the birthday party of the latter's child. While he was on his way thereto, he passed by a lighted waiting shed and saw Conrado drunk and sleeping on the bench. Not wanting to disturb his drunk and tired brother, he merely looked at him and continued on his way to the birthday party. Upon arriving at the party, he joined the other visitors in a drinking session. Among his drinking companions were his Kuya Nestor, Kuya Noel, a certain Rudy and Kitoy. He saw appellant and Ronilo drinking with another group of visitors. [9]\n\nLater, he noticed appellant and Ronilo walking away from their group and proceeding towards the lighted waiting shed which was about ten meters from the place where he and his group were drinking. Upon reaching the waiting shed, appellant and Ronilo woke up the sleeping Conrado. In order to carry Conrado, the two placed his arms around their shoulders and lifted him. Thereafter, they walked northwards. Subsequently, he excused himself from his companions and went to the house of his sister. [10]\n\nThe following day, he was informed that Conrado was already dead and that his body was found at the back of the house of a certain Ka Edro, which was at the northern direction, about fifty meters away from the waiting shed. He also found out that Conrado was hit with a piece of wood at the back of his head, and, that appellant and Ronilo were the culprits. [11]\n\nRonilo is the \" bilas \" of Conrado since their respective wives are sisters whereas the appellant is his brother-in-law. He stated that on 3 September 2000, at about 5:00 in the afternoon, appellant arrived at his house and invited him to a birthday party at the house of a certain Kumpareng Pitong. Upon arriving at the said house, he and appellant joined a group of drinkers which included Conrado and Simplicio. [12]\n\nDuring the drinking session, he heard appellant and Conrado arguing about a hoe. Appellant borrowed a hoe from Conrado a long time ago. Since then, appellant had not returned the same to Conrado. Thus, Conrado repeatedly mentioned the said hoe to appellant but the latter merely kept his silence. Later, he and appellant called it a night and left the party. While on their way home, they passed by a waiting shed and saw Conrado sleeping on the bench. Appellant woke up Conrado and both of them carried him by placing Conrado's arms around their shoulders. They told Conrado that they will bring him home. While they were walking, Conrado began berating the appellant for not returning the hoe. At first, appellant ignored the scolding of Conrado. Subsequently, however, appellant, irked and fed up, suddenly and without warning, stabbed Conrado with a stainless knife. When the stainless knife was broken, appellant pick up a piece of wood and hit Conrado four times in the head. Terrified, Ronilo ran away and proceeded to his house. On the following morning, he learned that Conrado was already dead. [13]\n\nSPO1 Marcelino Ligarte (SPO1 Ligarte) testified that on 4 September 2000, Police Investigator Mario Magnaye told him that four barangay tanods of Barangay Bulacnin, Lipa City, came to the police station and reported a killing incident in their barangay. He was also informed that the victim was Conrado and the suspect was the appellant. Upon learning that appellant was hiding at the house of his brother-in-law, namely, Ben Palma, at Barangay Masaya, Rosario, Batangas, he, together with a certain SPO3 Marasigan and the barangay tanods immediately proceeded to the said house. When they arrived at the house of Ben Palma, one of the barangay tanods recognized the appellant and pointed out the latter to them. He approached the appellant, held his hand, and told him that he was a suspect in the killing of Conrado. He also informed appellant that he had a right to remain silent and to hire the services of a lawyer. Appellant did not say anything. Thereafter, they brought appellant to the Lipa City Police Headquarters for investigation. [14]\n\nDr. Corazon Sabile (Dr. Sabile) was the Medical Officer IV of Lipa City. She testified that on 4 September 2000, at about 1:30 in the afternoon, she conducted a post mortem examination on the body of Conrado. She found Conrado's corpse in complete rigor mortis and concluded that Conrado had died ten hours prior to the examination. When she examined the head of Conrado, she discovered multiple wounds or sixteen cranium cerebral injuries, most of them located at the posterior portion or at the back of the head. According to her, Conrado sustained multiple fractures of the bones in the head which means that Conrado's occipital bones at the back portion of the skull were fractured. The skull had a total of eight fractures, five of them were located at the back of the head, one at the bone of the nose, one at the upper jaw and another at the lower jaw. [15]\n\nConsidering that most of the injuries sustained by Conrado were located at the back portion of his head, she opined that the assailant was positioned at the back of Conrado during the assault. She also believed that a hard or blunt object was used in inflicting such injuries since Conrado sustained three lacerated wounds at the right ear and four lacerated wounds at the left ear which could have been caused by contact with a hard object. She noted that Conrado sustained lacerated wounds at the mandibular area, upper left, fracture on the frontal interior bone of the head, two fractured lateral left side of the head and fracture at the left of the backbone. Conrado also suffered three 0.7 cms x 0.2 cms. linear abrasion on his interior upper chest which could have been caused by rubbing or scratching with a hard rough object. She prepared the death certificate of Conrado. [16]\n\nOn the other hand, the defense presented the lone testimony of appellant to refute the foregoing accusations.\n\nAppellant testified that he is a resident of Barangay Pagulingin, Lipa City. He narrated that on 3 September 2000, at about 4:00 in the afternoon, he arrived at the house of his sister, Antonia, and brother-in-law, Ronilo, at Barangay Bulacnin, Lipa City. At around 6:00 in the evening, Ronilo invited him to a birthday party at the house of Pitong Martija to which he agreed. [17]\n\nUpon arriving at the party at about 7:00 in the evening, he saw three tables outside the house. One of the tables was occupied by Conrado, Donald, a certain Rodel Tolentino and Genio Masongsong, who were then drinking gin. Instead of joining the same group, he and Ronilo opted to occupy another table, and, thereafter drank gin. [18]\n\nAt about 9:00 in the evening, Conrado left the birthday party. Donald and Ronilo also left the birthday party in order to accompany and bring Conrado home as the latter was already drunk. He, however, chose to stay at the birthday party and continued drinking gin. Subsequently, Donald and Ronilo returned to the party. Ronilo, then, invited him to stay at his house to which he acceded. Thereafter, he, Donald, and Ronilo left the birthday party and proceeded to the house of the latter. Upon arriving at Ronilo's house at about 10:00 in the evening, he lied down in a bed. He noticed that Donald and Ronilo were having a conversation. [19]\n\nAfter sleeping for a while, he woke up and went outside of the house to urinate. He observed that Donald and Ronilo were still conversing with each other, the topic of which he had no idea. After relieving himself, he returned to the bed and glanced at a clock nearby. He noticed that it was already 1:00 in the morning. Subsequently, he fell asleep again. [20]\n\nAppellant vehemently denied the truthfulness of the testimony of Simplicio claiming that the latter is not a resident of Barangay Bulacnin, and, that Simplicio is a paid witness. He also assailed the veracity of the testimony of Donald which according to him was ill-motivated. Lastly, he asseverated that Ronilo testified against him in order to be relieved of any liability. [21]\n\nOn 22 July 2002, the RTC rendered its Decision finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder. [22] It gave credence to the \"vivid and detailed account of the incident\" of the prosecution witnesses which according to it, \"vibrates with truth and sincerity.\" It noted that the nature, number and location of the wounds sustained by Conrado bolstered the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. It also found treachery in the commission of the crime since Conrado was \"dead drunk,\" unarmed, and unsuspecting, and, thus, incapable of defending himself at the time of the attack. It is its \"profound view,\" however, that Ronilo should have been included in the prosecution of the instant case. It also expressed the hope that the Department of Justice would inquire if the prosecution of Ronilo in the present case is still possible. In closing, the trial court held:\nACCORDINGLY, the Court finds the accused, ZOSIMO AGUILA y ATIENZA, guilty beyond per adventure of doubt, as principal by direct participation, of the crime of Murder, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, without any modifying circumstance, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA , to pay to the heirs of Conrado Enriquez the sums of P50,000.00, as indemnification for his death, P39,690.00, as actual damages and P50,000.00 as moral damages. With costs against accused.\nAffronted, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal with the RTC on 20 August 2002. [23] Subsequently, on 23 October 2002, appellant filed his Appellant's Brief directly with this Court assailing the Decision of the RTC dated 22 July 2002. Pursuant to our ruling in the case of People of the Philippines v. Efren Mateo y Garcia , we issued a Resolution dated 30 March 2005 transferring the instant case to the Court of Appeals for disposition. [24] On 18 July 2005, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision denying the appeal of appellant and affirming in toto the assailed RTC Decision. [25] The dispositive portion thereof reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant case is DENIED and the assailed Decision dated 22 July 2002, promulgated on 12 August 2002, of the Regional Trial Court of Lipa City, Branch 12 in Crim. Case No. 0451-2000 finding the appellant ZOSIMO AGUILA y ATIENZA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua , and ordering him to pay to the heirs of the victim Conrado Enriquez the amounts of Php39,690.00 as actual damages; Php50,000.00 as death indemnity; and Php 50,000.00 as moral damages, is hereby AFFIRMED.\nOn automatic review, appellant raised the following issues:\nI.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME OF MURDER.\n\nII.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE.\nApropos the first issue, appellant contends that the testimony of Ronilo does not deserve any credit as the same was filled with inconsistencies and contradictions. Ronilo testified during the trial that appellant stabbed Conrado with a stainless knife, and, that after the same knife got broken, appellant hit Conrado with a piece of wood four times. This, according to appellant, runs counter to the testimony of Dr. Sabile who declared that Conrado's death was caused by multiple cranium cerebral injuries, and, that she never mentioned finding any stab wounds on Conrado's body. Appellant also noted that the alleged stabbing of Conrado was not stated in Ronilo's Sinumpaang Salaysay , whereas, in his court testimony, Ronilo testified that after stabbing Conrado, appellant also clubbed Conrado with a piece of wood.\n\nThere is no merit in appellant's contention.\n\nWitnesses cannot be expected to give a flawless testimony all the time. This is even more true if they are called to testify on details of a harrowing and frightening event which unfolded before their eyes. Minor discrepancies might be found in their testimony but they do not damage the essential integrity of the evidence in its material whole, nor should they reflect adversely on the witness' credibility as they erase suspicion that the same was rehearsed or concocted. Honest inconsistencies on minor and trivial matters serve to strengthen rather than destroy the credibility of a witness to a crime. [26]\n\nThe inconsistencies cited by appellant refer to minor and insignificant details which do not impair the credibility of Ronilo as a witness. It appears that Ronilo's allegation that appellant stabbed Conrado is erroneous and baseless since Dr. Sabile did not find any stab wounds on Conrado's body. [27] It should be stressed, however, that in addition to his testimony that appellant stabbed Conrado, Ronilo also testified that appellant struck Conrado with a piece of wood four times on the head. [28] This testimony is consistent with the findings of Dr. Sabile who declared that the multiple fractures in Conrado's skull was caused by a hard or blunt instrument such as a piece of wood. [29]\n\nThus, Ronilo's allegation that appellant stabbed Conrado with a knife should be considered as a mere surplusage, an immaterial and irrelevant part of his testimony, since what is important and decisive is that Ronilo had seen appellant struck Conrado in the head with a piece of wood and that he testified on such fact during the trial.\n\nIt is true that during the trial Ronilo testified that appellant stabbed Conrado whereas in his Sinumpaang Salaysay he did not mention the same. Again, this minor inconsistency does not destroy the veracity of Ronilo's testimony since, in both cases, he mentioned the fact that appellant struck Conrado four times in the head with a piece of wood. Note must also be taken of the fact that Ronilo had testified on an incident which had occurred three years earlier. Error-free testimonies cannot be expected from him, considering the limitations of human memory. [30]\n\nAppellant also averred inconsistency in Ronilo's testimony when the latter testified that after attacking Conrado, appellant slept in his house without his knowledge. When he woke up the next morning, he saw appellant sleeping in his living room. This, according to appellant, contradicts Ronilo's other statement that he was frightened after witnessing the attack of appellant on Conrado. Appellant argued that if Ronilo was indeed frightened of the incident, he would have closed the doors and windows of his house and would not have allowed appellant to sleep in his house.\n\nWe do not subscribe to appellant's averments.\n\nAppellant himself had testified during the cross-examination that any person could enter the house of Ronilo since its gate can be opened from the outside even without a key, and, that he is familiar with the same house as it is also the house of his sister. He also stated that prior to the incident, there were times when he slept there whenever he got drunk, and, that he could sleep therein even if Ronilo and the appellant's sister are already asleep. [31]\n\nIt is also significant to note that Ronilo's account of how the gruesome act transpired was corroborated by Simplicio and Donald. Their testimonies on material and relevant points are substantially consistent with each other. More importantly, the testimony of Dr. Sabile that Conrado died of multiple fractures of the skull is in harmony with Ronilo's court testimony and Sinumpaang Salaysay that appellant hit Conrado with a piece of wood on the head.\n\nAs to the testimony of Simplicio, appellant argued that the same was perjured considering that the former's sworn statement was executed only on 11 July 2001 whereas the incident happened way back on 3 September 2000. With regard to the testimony of Donald, appellant asserted that it should not be given any weight as the former is merely angry at him for being an accused in the killing of his brother.\n\nEven these arguments fail to persuade us.\n\nThe fact that Simplicio did not immediately give a sworn statement to the authorities about the incident and his initial hesitation to testify in court on the same does not necessarily destroy the genuineness of his testimony. Witnesses are usually reluctant to volunteer information about a criminal case or are unwilling to be involved in or dragged into criminal investigations due to a variety of valid reasons. [32] Fear of reprisal and the natural reluctance of a witness to get involved in a criminal case are sufficient explanations for a witness' delay in reporting the crime to authorities. [33] After the incident, Simplicio feared for his and his family's safety if he testified against appellant. It is only after the lapse of one year that he agreed to divulge information about the incident in order to make sure that the possibility of a threat to his life or his loved ones is already diminished, if not totally avoided. Furthermore, no ill-motive can be imputed to Simplicio for testifying against appellant. Appellant himself admitted that he does not know of any reason why Simplicio would testify against him. [34]\n\nAs regards the testimony of Donald, it should be borne in mind that mere relationship of a witness to the victim does not automatically impair the credibility of said witness, where no improper motive can be ascribed to the latter for so testifying. [35] A witness' relationship to the victim of a crime, in fact, makes his testimony even more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative interested in vindicating a crime done to their family to accuse somebody other than the real culprit. [36] Donald has no improper motive to implicate appellant in the crime. As the younger brother of Conrado, his mere desire in testifying was to see to it that justice is served and the real killer of Conrado be punished.\n\nAppellant also alleged that treachery was not proven in the instant case, and, that a prior argument between him and Conrado negated the existence of treachery.\n\nWe disagree.\n\nTreachery is a sudden and unexpected attack under the circumstances that render the victim unable and unprepared to defend himself by reason of the suddenness and severity of the attack. [37] It is an aggravating circumstance that qualifies the killing of the person to murder. Article 14, paragraph (16), of the Revised Penal Code states the concept and essential elements of treachery as an aggravating circumstance, thus:\nART. 14. Aggravating circumstances. - The following are aggravating circumstances:\n\nx x x x\n\n16. That the act be committed with treachery ( alevosia ).\n\nThere is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.\nAs can be gleaned from the foregoing, two essential elements/conditions are required in order that treachery may be appreciated: (1) The employment of means, methods or manner of execution that would insure the offender's safety from any retaliatory act on the part of the offended party, who has, thus no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation; and (2) deliberate or conscious choice of means, methods or manner of execution. Further, it must always be alleged in the information and proved in trial in order that it may be validly considered. [38]\n\nIn the instant case, treachery was alleged in the information against appellant. Moreover, all the essential elements/conditions of treachery were established and proven during the trial.\n\nDuring their drinking session at the birthday party, Conrado repeatedly reminded appellant to return the hoe which the latter borrowed from the former a long time ago. Although he felt irritated and insulted as the same was heard by their other drinking buddies, appellant kept his silence and continued drinking gin. Later that evening, Conrado left the drinking session in order to accompany Simplicio in waiting for a ride home. Upon reaching a lighted waiting shed, Conrado, who was already \"dead drunk\" and tired from a long drinking session, laid down on the bench of the waiting shed and slept. Subsequently, appellant and Ronilo went to the waiting shed and woke up Conrado. Appellant told Conrado that they would bring him home. As Conrado was still groggy, weak and unable to walk, appellant and Ronilo placed his arms around their shoulders and carried him away. While they were walking, Conrado kept on murmuring to appellant about the unreturned hoe. Unable to control his anger anymore, appellant stopped walking. He removed Conrado's arm around his shoulder and pick up a piece of wood nearby. Realizing that his life was in danger, Conrado repeatedly shouted \" huwag ,\" Conrado tried to move away but he was too drunk and too weak. With all his might and anger, appellant repeatedly struck the hapless Conrado on the head with a piece of wood. Ronilo, who was shocked and confused upon seeing the grim act, ran away from the scene and proceeded to his house. Upon seeing that Conrado was already lying on the ground, bloodied and motionless, appellant fled the scene.\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing that Conrado was unarmed, \"dead drunk\" and was being carried away when the attack occurred. In such a helpless condition, it was absolutely impossible for Conrado to defend himself or retaliate against the onslaught of appellant. Appellant took advantage of the intoxication of Conrado so that the latter may not escape his deadly ire. Appellant had also deliberately and consciously adopted means and methods in insuring the cruel and painful demise of Conrado by picking up a piece of wood and using it to repeatedly hit the head of Conrado.\n\nWhile it is true that Conrado may have been warned of possible violence from appellant as the former kept on reminding the latter about an unreturned hoe, there is still treachery in the case at bar since what is decisive is that the attack was executed in such a manner as to make it impossible for the victim to retaliate. [39] As stated earlier, Conrado was unarmed, \"dead drunk\" and was therefore defenseless. Further, as Conrado's mind and body were heavily intoxicated, it was impossible or difficult for him to think and realize that appellant might retaliate against him.\n\nAnent the second issue, appellant asserted that the trial court should not have given weight on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. According to him, his own testimony deserves more credence and faith.\n\nAppellant's argument fails to sway us.\n\nJurisprudence dictates that when the credibility of a witness is in issue, the findings of fact of trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings are accorded high respect if not conclusive effect. [40] This is because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness and is in the best position to discern whether they are telling the truth. [41] In the instant case, the RTC gave credence to the \"vivid and detailed account of the incident\" of the prosecution witnesses which according to it, \"vibrates with truth and sincerity.\" It noted that the nature, number and location of the wounds sustained by Conrado bolstered the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. It also found no improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses in testifying against appellant.\n\nIt is also worth stressing that the Court of Appeals affirmed such findings of the RTC. In this regard, it is settled that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court. [42] We find no compelling reason to deviate from their findings.\n\nDuring the trial, appellant denied any liability and invoked alibi. Appellant asseverated that he was at the birthday party drinking gin at the time of the incident, and, that it was Donald and Ronilo who accompanied Conrado on the way to the latter's home.\n\nDenial is inherently a weak defense as it is negative and self-serving. [43] It cannot prevail over the positive identification and testimony of witnesses unless buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability. [44] In the case at bar, Ronilo testified that appellant had struck Conrado with a piece of wood on the head. Simplicio declared that appellant was at the crime scene during the attack while Donald stated that shortly before the incident, Conrado was in the company of appellant. Appellant had not presented any evidence to counter the afore-stated testimonies.\n\nFor alibi to prosper, it is not enough for the accused to prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed. He must likewise prove that it is physically impossible for him to be present at the crime scene or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. [45] If appellant had, as he claimed, remained at the birthday party when Donald and Ronilo allegedly brought Conrado home, it was not physically impossible for him to be present at the crime scene or in its immediate vicinity. The distance between the house where the birthday party took place and the vacant lot where the crime was committed is merely twenty meters.\n\nAs the appellant failed to substantiate his defenses of denial and alibi, the positive, categorical, and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses must prevail.\n\nWe also observed that appellant, who was a resident of Barangay Pagulingin, Lipa City, immediately left his residence after the incident. He went to the house of his brother-in-law, Ben Palma, in Barangay Masaya, Rosario, Batangas, where he was later arrested by the police of Lipa City. Appellant failed to explain his presence thereat. Thus, his flight after the incident is a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be drawn. [46] If he is truly innocent of the charge and his conscience is clear, there is no reason for him to run away and hide at the house of his brother-in-law.\n\nOn another point, we agree with the RTC and the Court of Appeals as regards the penalty imposed and damages awarded. However, in addition to these damages, exemplary damages should also be awarded to the heirs of Conrado since the qualifying circumstance of treachery was firmly established by the prosecution. [47] If a crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance, either qualifying or generic, an award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages is justified under Article 2230 of the New Civil Code. [48] This kind of damage is intended to serve as a deterrent to serious wrongdoings, and as a vindication of undue sufferings and wanton invasion of the rights of an injured or a punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct. [49]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 18 July 2005 is hereby AFFIRMED with a MODIFICATION that exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 is also awarded to the heirs of Conrado.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Celia C.

      "title": "It is, likewise, settled that the determination of whether or not an order of dismissal issued under such conditions should be maintained or reconsidered rests upon the sound discretion of the trial judge.[28] The next question to be resolved is whether there was grave abuse of discretion of the trial judge. We hold that there was none.The case of Estate of Salud Jimenez v. Philippine Export Processing Zone[29] discussed the propriety of filing a Petition for Certiorari under Section 1 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, thus:A petition for certiorari is the proper remedy when any tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law. Grave abuse of discretion is defined as the capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. An error of judgment committed in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction is not the same as \"grave abuse of discretion.\" An abuse of discretion is not sufficient by itself to justify the issuance of a writ of certiorari. The abuse must be grave and patent, and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily and despotically. As a general rule, a petition for certiorari will not lie if an appeal is the proper remedy thereto such as when an error of judgment as well as of procedure are involved. As long as a court acts within its jurisdiction and does not gravely abuse its discretion in the exercise thereof, any supposed error committed by it will amount to nothing more than an error of judgment reviewable by a timely appeal and not assailable by a special civil action of certiorari. However, in certain exceptional cases, where the rigid application of such rule will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, the provisions of the Rules of Court which are technical rules may be relaxed. Certiorari has been deemed to be justified, for instance, in order to prevent irreparable damage and injury to a party where the trial judge has capriciously and whimsically exercised his judgment, or where there may be danger of clear failure of justice, or where an ordinary appeal would simply be inadequate to relieve a party from the injurious effects of the judgment complained of.[30] (Emphasis supplied)Lack of jurisdiction and excess of jurisdiction are distinguished thus: the respondent acts without jurisdiction if he does not have the legal power to determine the case; where the respondent, being clothed with the power to determine the case, oversteps his authority as determined by law, he is performing a function in excess of his jurisdiction.[31] Thus, we now discuss whether the trial court granted the motion for reconsideration of Sui and reinstated the complaint without basis in law. Citing the case of Ace Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals,[32] the trial court held that rules of procedures are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice and must be relaxed if its strict and rigid application would frustrate rather than promote substantial justice. Thus, it lifted and set aside its order of dismissal in the interest of substantial justice, which is the legal basis for the trial court to grant the motion for reconsideration of Sui.We have repeatedly warned against the injudicious and often impetuous issuance of default orders.[33] While it is desirable that the Rules of Court be faithfully observed, courts should not be so strict about procedural lapses that do not really impair the proper administration of justice. If the rules are intended to ensure the proper and orderly conduct of litigation, it is because of the higher objective they seek which is the attainment of justice and the protection of substantive rights of the parties. Thus, the relaxation of procedural rules, or saving a particular case from the operation of technicalities when substantial justice requires it, as in the instant case, should no longer be subject to cavil.[34]When the Court of Appeals held that the case is dismissible because Sui did not attend the pre-trial conference, it failed to consider the explanation of Atty. Ferrer that Sui executed a \"Special Power of Attorney\" in his behalf and that he was not absent on the scheduled pre-trial but was only late. Under Section 4 of Rule 18 of the Rules,[35] the non-appearance of a party at the pre-trial may be excused when there is a valid cause shown or when a representative shall appear in his behalf, and is fully authorized in writing to enter into an amicable settlement, to submit to alternative modes of dispute resolution, and to enter into stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents. Although Sui was absent during the pre-trial, Atty. Ferrer alleged that he was fully authorized to represent Sui. Moreover, it is not entirely accurate to state that Atty. Ferrer was absent during the pre-trial because he was only late, the reasons for which he explained in his Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration. The circumstances attendant in the instant case compel this Court to relax the rules of procedure in the interest of substantial justice.Petitioners claim that the motion for reconsideration of Sui was procedurally defective because it was not served three days before the date of the hearing and no proof of service was given to the court, in violation of Sections 4 and 6 of Rule 15. Petitioners also aver that they received the Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration of Sui on May 27, 2004 but the hearing was scheduled on May 28, 2004. Thus, it is nothing but a scrap of paper because it violated the three-day notice rule. We are not persuaded.In the instant case, we find that the purpose of a notice of hearing had been served. In Vlason Enterprises Corporation v. Court of Appeals,[36] we enumerated the exceptions to the rule on notice of hearing, to wit:The Court has consistently held that a motion which does not meet the requirements of Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court is considered a worthless piece of paper, which the clerk of court has no right to receive and the trial court has no authority to act upon. Service of a copy of a motion containing a notice of the time and the place of hearing of that motion is a mandatory requirement, and the failure of movants to comply with these requirements renders their motions fatally defective. However, there are exceptions to the strict application of this rule. These exceptions are as follows:\"x x x Liberal construction of this rule has been allowed by this Court in cases (1) where a rigid application will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice; especially if a party successfully shows that the alleged defect in the questioned final and executory judgment is not apparent on its face or from the recitals contained therein; (2) where the interest of substantial justice will be served; (3) where the resolution of the motion is addressed solely to the sound and judicious discretion of the court; and (4) where the injustice to the adverse party is not commensurate [to] the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed.\"The present case falls under the first exception. Petitioner was not informed of any cause of action or claim against it. All of a sudden, the vessels which petitioner used in its salvaging business were levied upon and sold in execution to satisfy a supposed judgment against it. To allow this to happen simply because of a lapse in fulfilling the notice requirement \u2013 which, as already said, was satisfactorily explained \u2013 would be a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice.A notice of hearing is conceptualized as an integral component of procedural due process intended to afford the adverse parties a chance to be heard before a motion is resolved by the court. Through such notice, the adverse party is permitted time to study and answer the arguments in the motion.Circumstances in the case at bar show that private respondent was not denied procedural due process, and that the very purpose of a notice of hearing had been served. On the day of the hearing, Atty. Desierto did not object to the said Motion for lack of notice to him; in fact, he was furnished in open court with a copy of the motion and was granted by the trial court thirty days to file his opposition to it. These circumstances clearly justify a departure from the literal application of the notice of hearing rule. In other cases, after the trial court learns that a motion lacks such notice, the prompt resetting of the hearing with due notice to all the parties is held to have cured the defect.Verily, the notice requirement is not a ritual to be followed blindly. Procedural due process is not based solely on a mechanistic and literal application that renders any deviation inexorably fatal. Instead, procedural rules are liberally construed to promote their objective and to assist in obtaining a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of any action and proceeding. For the foregoing reasons, we believe that Respondent Court committed reversible error in holding that the Motion for Reconsideration was a mere scrap of paper.[37] (Emphasis supplied)When the trial court received Sui's Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration, it did not immediately resolve the motion. Instead, it allowed petitioners to file their comment and also leave to file a rejoinder if Sui files a reply.[38] These circumstances justify a departure from the literal application of the rule because petitioners were given the opportunity to study and answer the arguments in the motion.Petitioners' claim that Sui failed to attach proof of service in violation of Section 6, Rule 15 of the Rule, must fail. In Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals,[39] we held, thus:Nonetheless, considering the question raised in the appeal of the government and the amount involved in this case, we think the Court of Appeals should have considered the subsequent service of the motion for reconsideration to be a substantial compliance with the requirement in Rule 15, \u00a76. In De Rapisura v. Nicolas, the movant also failed to attach to his motion for reconsideration proof of service of a copy thereof to the other party. Nonetheless, this Court held the failure not fatal as the adverse party had actually received a copy of the motion and was in fact present in court when the motion was heard. It was held that the demands of substantial justice were satisfied by the actual receipt of said motion under those conditions.[40]Petitioners admitted that they received a copy of Sui's Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration. In fact, they had the opportunity to oppose the same. Under these circumstances, we find that the demands of substantial justice and due process were satisfied.It is the policy of the Court to afford party-litigants the amplest opportunity to enable them to have their cases justly determined, free from the constraints of technicalities.[41] It should be remembered that rules of procedure are but tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice, such that when rigid application of the rules tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, this Court is empowered to suspend their operation.[42]WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated September 22, 2005 and the Resolution dated October 27, 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 88863 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

SP No. 88863 entitled, \"Vette Industrial Sales, Company, Inc., Kenneth Tan, Estrella Cheng, Luisito Ramos, Yvette Tan, Kessenth Cheng, Vevette Cheng, and Felesavette Cheng, Petitioners versus Hon. Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 173, and Sui Soan S. Cheng a.k.a. Cheng Sui Soan, Respondents .\" Also assailed is the Resolution [3] dated October 27, 2005 denying petitioners' motion for partial reconsideration and respondent Sui's motion for reconsideration.\n\nIn his Complaint [4] for specific performance and damages filed against Vette Industrial Sales Company, Inc., Kenneth Tan, Estrella Cheng, Luisito Ramos, Yvette Tan, Kessenth Cheng, Vevette Cheng, and Felesavette Cheng (petitioners) and docketed as Civil Case No. 03-105691, Sui Soan S. Cheng a.k.a. Cheng Sui Soan (Sui) alleged that on October 24, 2001, he executed a Deed of Assignment, [5] where he transferred his 40,000 shares in the company in favor of Kenneth Tan, Vevette Cheng, Felesavette Cheng, and Yvette Tan (Petitioners-Assignees). To implement the Deed of Assignment, the company acknowledged in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), [6] that it owed him P6.8 million pesos, plus insurance proceeds amounting to P760,000.00 and a signing bonus of P300,000.00. Thereafter, he was issued 48 postdated checks but after the 11th check, the remaining checks were dishonored by the bank. Sui also claimed that petitioners did not remit to him the insurance proceeds, thus breaching their obligation under the MOA which entitled him to moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.\n\nIn their Answer With Compulsory Counterclaim, [7] petitioners alleged that Sui sold his shares for only P1.00 per share which they already paid; that the MOA was unenforceable because it was executed without authorization from the board of directors; that the MOA was void for want of consideration; and that petitioner Kenneth Tan executed the MOA after Sui issued threats and refused to sign the waiver and quitclaim.\n\nAfter the issues were joined, pre-trial was set on July 3, 2003. [8] However, the case was first submitted for mediation but it was referred back to the court for continuation of the proceedings when no settlement was arrived at during mediation.\n\nSui thereafter filed a Motion to Set Pre-trial [9] on December 16, 2003. Petitioners received the motion but they did not attend because there was no notice from the Court setting the pre-trial date. On December 29, 2003, petitioners received two orders from the trial court. The first Order [10] allowed Sui to present evidence ex-parte, while the second Order [11] revoked the first order after the trial court noted that \"what was set for consideration on December 16, 2003 was merely a motion to set pre-trial.\" Thus, the trial court reset the pre-trial on January 15, 2004 but it was postponed and moved to May 21, 2004. On said date, Sui and his counsel, Atty. Pedro M. Ferrer (Atty. Ferrer), failed to appear. Consequently, the trial court ordered the dismissal of the case without prejudice on the part of petitioners to present and prove their counterclaim and set the hearing for reception of evidence on June 22, 2004. [12]\n\nAtty. Ferrer filed a Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration [13] of the order of dismissal, explaining that he arrived late for the hearing because he had to drop by his office to get the case folder because he had just arrived from South Cotabato where he served as Chief Counsel in the Provincial Board of Canvassers for Governor Datu Pax Mangudadatu and Congressman Suharto Mangudadatu.\n\nThe trial court required petitioners to file their Comment on the Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration. In their Opposition, [14] petitioners asserted that the motion for reconsideration be denied outright because (1) Sui did not comply with the three-day notice rule which is mandatory under Section 4, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court considering that petitioners received the manifestation and motion for reconsideration only one day prior to the date of hearing of the motion for resolution, thus the same must be treated as a mere scrap of paper; (2) the trial court did not comply with Section 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules [15] when it acted on the manifestation and motion of Sui despite the latter's failure to submit proof of receipt by petitioners of the manifestation and motion; (3) the negligence of counsel binds the client, thus, when Atty. Ferrer arrived late for the hearing, the trial court correctly dismissed the complaint; and (4) the explanation of Atty. Ferrer is unacceptable because traffic gridlocks are daily events in the metropolis, thus, Atty. Ferrer should have left his place early.\n\nIn his Reply, [16] Sui averred that the motion complied with Section 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules [17] and that the setting of the hearing of the motion on May 28, 2004 was within the three day period for it was filed on May 25, 2004. He added that the same was not heard because the trial court allowed petitioners to file a comment on the manifestation and motion for reconsideration, which was received by the latter prior to the said setting.\n\nIn an Order dated December 16, 2004, [18] the trial court granted Sui's motion for reconsideration and set aside the dismissal of the complaint, the dispositive portion of which provides:\nWHEREFORE, prescinding with such ruling and in the interest of substantial justice, plaintiff's motion is GRANTED and the order dated May 21, 2004 is hereby lifted and set aside with the warning that any delay in this proceedings will not be countenanced by the Court.\n\nSet pre-trial anew on February 15, 2005.\n\nNotify the parties.\n\nSO ORDERED. [19] The trial court cited Ace Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals , [20] which held that since rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice, their strict and rigid application which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice must always be avoided \u2013 the dismissal of an appeal on purely technical ground is frowned upon especially if it will result to unfairness.\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration [21] filed by petitioners was denied by the trial court [22] hence they filed a Petition for Certiorari [23] with the Court of Appeals which granted the petition, thus:\nUPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS, the writ applied for is partly GRANTED. The assailed orders must be, as they hereby are, VACATED and SET ASIDE, and another hereby issued dismissing the instant complaint, but \"without prejudice.\" This means that the complaint can be REINSTATED. On the other hand, petitioners are hereby given leave to present before the Trial Court evidence of their counterclaim. Without costs in this instance.\n\nSO ORDERED. [24] The Court of Appeals noted that both Atty. Ferrer and Sui were not in attendance at the pre-trial conference; that Section 5 of Rule 18 mentions only the effect of the failure to appear on the part of \"the plaintiff\" but is silent on the effect of failure of the party's counsel to appear at the pre-trial; that the Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration [25] mentioned only the reasons why Atty. Ferrer was absent without stating that he was fully authorized in writing to enter into an amicable settlement, or to submit to alternative modes of dispute resolution, or to enter into stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents; and that there was no explanation for Sui's nonappearance. Thus, based on these circumstances, the Court of Appeals held that dismissal of the case is proper but without prejudice to the filing of a new action. [26]\n\nBoth parties moved for reconsideration but the same were jointly denied in a Resolution dated October 27, 2005.\n\nHence, these consolidated Petitions.\n\nIn G.R. No. 170232 , petitioners raise the following errors:\nI.\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT OF RESPONDENT CHENG IN CIVIL CASE NO. 03-105691 WITH PREJUDICE.\n\nII.\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT RESPONDENT'S COUNSEL FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE BASIC RULES ON PRE-TRIAL.\n\nIII.\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE MISTAKE OR NEGLIGENCE OF RESPONDENT'S COUNSEL AS BINDING ON THE RESPONDENT HIMSELF.\n\nIV.\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN APPLYING THE RULINGS OF THE HONORABLE COURT IN THE DE LOS REYES VS. CAPULE ( 102 PHIL. 464 ) AND SUAREZ VS. COURT OF APPEALS ( 220 SCRA 274 ) CASES.\n\nV.\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING RESPONDENT'S MANIFESTATION AND MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DATED MAY 21, 2004 FILED BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT AS A MERE SCRAP, AND A USELESS PIECE, OF PAPER AND IN NOT CONSIDERING THE ORDER DATED MAY 21, 2004 OF THE TRIAL COURT AS ALREADY FINAL IN VIEW OF THE PROCEDURAL INVALIDITY/DEFECTIVENESS (I.E. IT FAILED TO COMPLY WITH SECTIONS 4 AND 6 OF THE RULES) OF RESPONDENT'S MANIFESTATION AND MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DATED MAY 21, 2004. In G.R. No. 170301 , Sui raises the following issues, thus:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT THE NON-APPEARANCE OF PETITIONER IN THE PRE-TRIAL MAY BE EXCUSED FOR A VALID CAUSE.\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT THE CASE OF ACE NAVIGATION CO. INC. VS. COURT OF APPEALS IS SQUARELY APPLICABLE TO THE INSTANT CASE. The core issue for resolution is whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing without prejudice Civil Case No. 03-105691 and in ruling that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion when it granted Sui's motion for reconsideration to set aside the order of dismissal of the complaint.\n\nThe judge has the discretion whether or not to declare a party non-suited. [27] It is, likewise, settled that the determination of whether or not an order of dismissal issued under such conditions should be maintained or reconsidered rests upon the sound discretion of the trial judge. [28] The next question to be resolved is whether there was grave abuse of discretion of the trial judge. We hold that there was none.\n\nThe case of Estate of Salud Jimenez v. Philippine Export Processing Zone [29] discussed the propriety of filing a Petition for Certiorari under Section 1 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, thus:\nA petition for certiorari is the proper remedy when any tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law. Grave abuse of discretion is defined as the capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. An error of judgment committed in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction is not the same as \"grave abuse of discretion.\" An abuse of discretion is not sufficient by itself to justify the issuance of a writ of certiorari. The abuse must be grave and patent, and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily and despotically.\n\nAs a general rule, a petition for certiorari will not lie if an appeal is the proper remedy thereto such as when an error of judgment as well as of procedure are involved. As long as a court acts within its jurisdiction and does not gravely abuse its discretion in the exercise thereof, any supposed error committed by it will amount to nothing more than an error of judgment reviewable by a timely appeal and not assailable by a special civil action of certiorari. However, in certain exceptional cases, where the rigid application of such rule will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, the provisions of the Rules of Court which are technical rules may be relaxed. Certiorari has been deemed to be justified, for instance, in order to prevent irreparable damage and injury to a party where the trial judge has capriciously and whimsically exercised his judgment, or where there may be danger of clear failure of justice, or where an ordinary appeal would simply be inadequate to relieve a party from the injurious effects of the judgment complained of. [30] (Emphasis supplied) Lack of jurisdiction and excess of jurisdiction are distinguished thus: the respondent acts without jurisdiction if he does not have the legal power to determine the case; where the respondent, being clothed with the power to determine the case, oversteps his authority as determined by law, he is performing a function in excess of his jurisdiction. [31] Thus, we now discuss whether the trial court granted the motion for reconsideration of Sui and reinstated the complaint without basis in law. Citing the case of Ace Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, [32] the trial court held that rules of procedures are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice and must be relaxed if its strict and rigid application would frustrate rather than promote substantial justice. Thus, it lifted and set aside its order of dismissal in the interest of substantial justice, which is the legal basis for the trial court to grant the motion for reconsideration of Sui.\n\nWe have repeatedly warned against the injudicious and often impetuous issuance of default orders. [33] While it is desirable that the Rules of Court be faithfully observed, courts should not be so strict about procedural lapses that do not really impair the proper administration of justice. If the rules are intended to ensure the proper and orderly conduct of litigation, it is because of the higher objective they seek which is the attainment of justice and the protection of substantive rights of the parties. Thus, the relaxation of procedural rules, or saving a particular case from the operation of technicalities when substantial justice requires it, as in the instant case, should no longer be subject to cavil. [34]\n\nWhen the Court of Appeals held that the case is dismissible because Sui did not attend the pre-trial conference, it failed to consider the explanation of Atty. Ferrer that Sui executed a \"Special Power of Attorney\" in his behalf and that he was not absent on the scheduled pre-trial but was only late.\n\nUnder Section 4 of Rule 18 of the Rules, [35] the non-appearance of a party at the pre-trial may be excused when there is a valid cause shown or when a representative shall appear in his behalf, and is fully authorized in writing to enter into an amicable settlement, to submit to alternative modes of dispute resolution, and to enter into stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents. Although Sui was absent during the pre-trial, Atty. Ferrer alleged that he was fully authorized to represent Sui. Moreover, it is not entirely accurate to state that Atty. Ferrer was absent during the pre-trial because he was only late, the reasons for which he explained in his Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration. The circumstances attendant in the instant case compel this Court to relax the rules of procedure in the interest of substantial justice.\n\nPetitioners claim that the motion for reconsideration of Sui was procedurally defective because it was not served three days before the date of the hearing and no proof of service was given to the court, in violation of Sections 4 and 6 of Rule 15. Petitioners also aver that they received the Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration of Sui on May 27, 2004 but the hearing was scheduled on May 28, 2004. Thus, it is nothing but a scrap of paper because it violated the three-day notice rule.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nIn the instant case, we find that the purpose of a notice of hearing had been served. In Vlason Enterprises Corporation v. Court of Appeals , [36] we enumerated the exceptions to the rule on notice of hearing, to wit:\nThe Court has consistently held that a motion which does not meet the requirements of Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court is considered a worthless piece of paper, which the clerk of court has no right to receive and the trial court has no authority to act upon. Service of a copy of a motion containing a notice of the time and the place of hearing of that motion is a mandatory requirement, and the failure of movants to comply with these requirements renders their motions fatally defective. However, there are exceptions to the strict application of this rule. These exceptions are as follows:\n\"x x x Liberal construction of this rule has been allowed by this Court in cases (1) where a rigid application will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice; especially if a party successfully shows that the alleged defect in the questioned final and executory judgment is not apparent on its face or from the recitals contained therein; (2) where the interest of substantial justice will be served; (3) where the resolution of the motion is addressed solely to the sound and judicious discretion of the court; and (4) where the injustice to the adverse party is not commensurate [to] the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed.\" The present case falls under the first exception. Petitioner was not informed of any cause of action or claim against it. All of a sudden, the vessels which petitioner used in its salvaging business were levied upon and sold in execution to satisfy a supposed judgment against it. To allow this to happen simply because of a lapse in fulfilling the notice requirement \u2013 which, as already said, was satisfactorily explained \u2013 would be a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice.\n\nA notice of hearing is conceptualized as an integral component of procedural due process intended to afford the adverse parties a chance to be heard before a motion is resolved by the court. Through such notice, the adverse party is permitted time to study and answer the arguments in the motion.\n\nCircumstances in the case at bar show that private respondent was not denied procedural due process, and that the very purpose of a notice of hearing had been served. On the day of the hearing, Atty. Desierto did not object to the said Motion for lack of notice to him; in fact, he was furnished in open court with a copy of the motion and was granted by the trial court thirty days to file his opposition to it. These circumstances clearly justify a departure from the literal application of the notice of hearing rule. In other cases, after the trial court learns that a motion lacks such notice, the prompt resetting of the hearing with due notice to all the parties is held to have cured the defect.\n\nVerily, the notice requirement is not a ritual to be followed blindly. Procedural due process is not based solely on a mechanistic and literal application that renders any deviation inexorably fatal. Instead, procedural rules are liberally construed to promote their objective and to assist in obtaining a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of any action and proceeding. For the foregoing reasons, we believe that Respondent Court committed reversible error in holding that the Motion for Reconsideration was a mere scrap of paper. [37] (Emphasis supplied) When the trial court received Sui's Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration, it did not immediately resolve the motion. Instead, it allowed petitioners to file their comment and also leave to file a rejoinder if Sui files a reply. [38] These circumstances justify a departure from the literal application of the rule because petitioners were given the opportunity to study and answer the arguments in the motion.\n\nPetitioners' claim that Sui failed to attach proof of service in violation of Section 6, Rule 15 of the Rule, must fail. In Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals , [39] we held, thus:\nNonetheless, considering the question raised in the appeal of the government and the amount involved in this case, we think the Court of Appeals should have considered the subsequent service of the motion for reconsideration to be a substantial compliance with the requirement in Rule 15, \u00a76. In De Rapisura v. Nicolas, the movant also failed to attach to his motion for reconsideration proof of service of a copy thereof to the other party. Nonetheless, this Court held the failure not fatal as the adverse party had actually received a copy of the motion and was in fact present in court when the motion was heard. It was held that the demands of substantial justice were satisfied by the actual receipt of said motion under those conditions . [40] Petitioners admitted that they received a copy of Sui's Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration. In fact, they had the opportunity to oppose the same. Under these circumstances, we find that the demands of substantial justice and due process were satisfied.\n\nIt is the policy of the Court to afford party-litigants the amplest opportunity to enable them to have their cases justly determined, free from the constraints of technicalities. [41] It should be remembered that rules of procedure are but tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice, such that when rigid application of the rules tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, this Court is empowered to suspend their operation. [42]\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated September 22, 2005 and the Resolution dated October 27, 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

BALUT, PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 76 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (NCRJ, QUEZON CITY), THE SHERIFF OF RTC, BRANCH 76, ENGR. ERNESTO G. BAUTISTA/ DYNAMIC BLASTING SPECIALIST OF THE PHILIPPINES AND NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS\nD E C I S I O N\nFIRST UNITED CONSTRUCTORS CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. ALEXANDER S. BALUT, PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 76 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (NCRJ, QUEZON CITY), THE SHERIFF OF RTC, BRANCH 76, ENGR. ERNESTO G. BAUTISTA/ DYNAMIC BLASTING SPECIALIST OF THE PHILIPPINES AND NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nWe resolve the Petition [1] dated March 30, 2006 filed by First United Constructors Corporation (FUCC), seeking the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction annulling the Court of Appeals' Resolution [2] of even date, which directed respondents to file their comment on FUCC's petition in CA-G.R. SP. No. 93586 but denied the latter's prayer for the issuance of a TRO.\n\nThe factual antecedents are as follows:\n\nIn National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto , [3] the Court awarded the amount of Seventy Four Million Thirty-Five Thousand Five Hundred Three Pesos and Fifty Centavos (P74,035,503.50) plus interest to FUCC in relation to its claim against National Power Corporation (NPC). The amount represented the just compensation payable to FUCC for the blasting work it undertook in connection with its contract with NPC for the construction of power facilities. The decision became final and executory on January 4, 2005.\n\nFUCC filed a motion with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 99, Quezon City, for the appointment of a new implementing sheriff to complete the implementation of a previously issued Writ of Execution in accordance with National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto . Subsequently, a certain Engr. Ernesto Bautista (Bautista) of Dynamic Blasting Specialist of the Philippines filed a motion with the trial court asking the court to direct the branch sheriff to turn over to him the sum of Thirty Seven Million Seven Hundred Twenty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Three Pesos (P37,723,823.00), plus interest, allegedly belonging to him. The motion was set for hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing, FUCC manifested that it does not recognize the personality of Bautista to file the motion since Bautista was not a party to the case. It reiterated its manifestation in its Ex-Parte Comment Ad Cautelam praying that Bautista's motion be expunged as he does not have personality to file a motion with the court not having been a party to the proceedings in the case. NPC also filed a comment.\n\nThe trial court issued an Order [4] dated July 18, 2005, holding that it has jurisdiction to determine Bautista's claim. Citing Paman, et al. v. Hon. Seneris, et al. [5] and Yap v. Hon. Ta\u00f1ada, etc., et al., [6] the trial court ruled that it has the power to determine all issues of fact and law which may be involved in the execution of a case and that in the interest of substantial justice, one who is not a party to a case is entitled to enter the same to get his claim. The trial court found that both FUCC and NPC recognize Bautista as the sub-contractor for the blasting works. Being a privy to the case was bound by the decision in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto is binding on Bautista. Accordingly, the trial court granted Bautista's motion and directed that the respective money claims of FUCC and Bautista shall be satisfied through the release of the funds of NPC deposited with the Land Bank of the Philippines (Land Bank). It then ordered that the amount of P37,723,823.00 due Bautista shall be deducted from the amount of P74,035,503.50 adjudged to FUCC in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto . An Alias Writ of Execution [7] dated July 29, 2005 was issued pursuant to this Order of the trial court.\n\nIn a Resolution [8] dated August 8, 2005, the Court, upon FUCC's filing of an Urgent Motion for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order, directed the trial court to maintain the status quo as of August 3, 2005 until further orders from it. Subsequently, the Court granted FUCC's Motion for Leave to Withdraw Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order .\n\nFUCC then sought the annulment of the July 18, 2005 Order of the trial court. Its motion was denied in the Order [9] dated March 8, 2006 issued by Hon. Alexander S. Balut of the RTC, Branch 76, Quezon City, on the grounds that the trial court cannot interfere with an order of a judge of another branch of the same court and that the questioned order had already attained finality.\n\nFUCC questioned the Orders dated July 18, 2005 [10] and March 8, 2006, [11] as well as the Alias Writ of Execution [12] dated July 29, 2005, before the Court of Appeals via a petition for certiorari and prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a TRO and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction but the appellate court refused the issuance of a TRO for failure of FUCC to show facts that would entitle it to the relief demanded.\n\nIn this Petition, FUCC alleges that the Order dated July 18, 2005 is a patent nullity and therefore never attained finality. FUCC argues that the Order dated July 18, 2005 altered the final decision of the Court in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto . The trial court had the opportunity to correct this grievous error but the judge to whom the case was re-raffled refused to annul the order on the ground that it cannot annul an order of a judge of another branch of the same court. FUCC contends that the doctrine against intra-court interference is not violated when the judge of a branch who annuls or modifies the order issued by a judge of another branch acts in the same case and belongs to the same court. It points out that Civil Case No. Q-94-20062 was merely re-raffled to RTC, Branch 76, Quezon City upon the inhibition of the Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 99, Quezon City.\n\nIn the Resolution [13] dated April 17, 2006, the Court required respondents to comment on the petition and directed the issuance of a TRO enjoining the trial court and the Branch Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 76, from implementing the Order dated March 8, 2006 and the Alias Writ of Execution dated July 29, 2005 until further orders from the Court.\n\nA Comment [14] dated April 27, 2006 was filed by Atty. Amador F. Brioso, Jr. supposedly on behalf of Bautista. However, in a Manifestation [15] dated May 2, 2006, Bautista himself informed the Court that he had already discharged his counsel and that he intends to hire a new counsel to review the procedure adopted by his former counsel. Bautista subsequently filed a Manifestation/Motion [16] dated May 10, 2006, informing the Court that he filed Civil Case No. Q-06-57869 for specific performance with damages against FUCC, NPC and Land Bank upon the advise of his new counsel, and praying that the Court exclude the amount of P37,723,823.00 from the decision in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto pending the resolution of the case which he filed.\n\nIn his Comment [17] dated August 28, 2006, Bautista again states that he has filed the appropriate collection case with the trial court and reiterates the prayer in his Manifestation/Motion.\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Comment [18] dated August 24, 2006 on behalf of the NPC, averring that the petition should be dismissed on the ground of forum-shopping. Moreover, there is allegedly no basis for the issuance of an injunctive writ because the procedure laid down in Presidential Decree No. 1445 directing that all money claims against the government must first be filed with the Commission on Audit was not complied with.\n\nThe main question for resolution is whether the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to issue the TRO prayed for by FUCC in C.A.-G.R. SP. No. 93586. However, in order to finally settle the present controversy, and in view of the fact that this case is fundamentally just an offshoot of our decision in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto , we shall also resolve the collateral issues pertaining to the validity of the Orders of the trial court dated July 18, 2005 and March 8, 2006, and the Alias Writ of Execution dated July 29, 2005.\n\nIn denying the TRO, the appellate court held that the dissolution of this Court's status quo order dated August 8, 2005 rendered the trial court's Order dated July 18, 2005 and its Alias Writ of Execution dated July 29, 2005 enforceable. Hence, FUCC is no longer entitled to a TRO.\n\nA reading of the Resolution dated August 8, 2005 readily reveals that the Court categorically enjoined the RTC, Branch 99, Quezon City, \"from taking any further action relative to the implementation of its Order dated July 18, 2005 x x x x until further orders from this Court.\" [19] The status quo order was predicated on FUCC's allegation, which the Court deemed meritorious, that in issuing the Order dated July 18, 2005, \"the trial court effectively allowed the intervention of Bautista without any motion to intervene having been filed by the latter, re-opened the case, admitted alleged new evidence, and rendered a new decision altering the Decision of this Court.\" [20]\n\nThe subsequent withdrawal of FUCC's Urgent Motion for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order [21] upon its manifestation that it shall assail the Order dated July 18, 2005 in the Court of Appeals did not affect the basis for the issuance of the status quo order. In fact, in the Resolution [22] dated January 16, 2006 granting FUCC's motion for leave, the Court deliberately did not lift the status quo order, fully cognizant of the need to continue to enjoin the implementation of the Order dated July 18, 2005 until it shall have been finally determined that the latter does not alter, amend or modify the Court's decision in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto .\n\nSuch action by the Court should have prompted the appellate court to make its own independent evaluation of FUCC's allegations in support of its prayer for TRO instead of perfunctorily denying the same. The factual antecedents of this case should have made it obvious to the Court of Appeals that the preservation of the status quo is both desirable and essential. [23]\n\nIt is significant to note, moreover, that Bautista has chosen another avenue of redress by filing a separate complaint for specific performance with the RTC, effectively abandoning his earlier assertion that the Orders of the trial court dated July 18, 2005 and March 8, 2006 are valid. His prayer in this case that the Court exclude the amount of P37,723,823.00 from the award to FUCC in the amount of P74,035,503.50 plus interest adjudged in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto is utterly baseless.\n\nWe should reiterate, in this connection, that the decision in National Power Corporation v. Alonzo-Legasto awarded to FUCC the amount of P74,035,503.50 plus legal interest. Nowhere in the decision did we rule on Bautista's entitlement to even a portion of this amount. The trial court committed egregious error in altering the clear tenor of this decision by directing that the respective money claims of FUCC and Bautista shall be satisfied through the release of the funds of NPC deposited with the Land Bank and ordering that the amount of P37,723,823.00 be deducted from the award to FUCC. By refusing to issue a TRO, the appellate court abetted this grave error, in effect sustaining the trial court's orders amending or altering a final and executory judgment.\n\nPublic policy and sound practice demand that at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final and irrevocable at some definite date fixed by law. This is better observed if the court executing the judgment would refrain from creating further controversy by effectively modifying and altering the dispositive portion of the decision, thus further delaying the satisfaction of the judgment. No matter how just the intention of the trial court, it cannot legally reverse what has already been settled. [24]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated March 30, 2006, as well as the Order dated March 8, 2006 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 76, Quezon City, and the Order dated July 18, 2005 and Alias Writ of Execution dated July 29, 2005 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 99, Quezon City, in Civil Case No. Q-94-20062, are hereby ANNULLED AND SET ASIDE.

NO. 6517, December 06, 2006 ]\n\nMARCOS V. PRIETO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. OSCAR B. CORPUZ AND JUDGE FERDINAND A. FE, RESPONDENTS.R E S O L U T I O N\nMARCOS V. PRIETO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. OSCAR B. CORPUZ AND JUDGE FERDINAND A. FE, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nThis is an administrative complaint filed by Atty. Marcos V. Prieto, against respondent Judge Ferdinand A. Fe, both as a member of the bar and bench, and respondent Atty. Oscar B. Corpuz as a member of the bar, for dishonesty, serious misconduct prejudicial to the integrity and dignity of the Judiciary under Section 27, Rule 138 and Section 1, Rule 137 of the Revised Rules of Court relative to the latter's actuations in the handling of Civil Case No. 1081-BG entitled, Yolanda M. Roque v. Atty. Marcos V. Prieto, et al. and Civil Case No. 1518-BG entitled, Yolanda Marquez Roque v. Atty. Marcos V. Prieto, et al.\n\nComplainant implies that not only did the respondent lawyer had free access to the records of Civil Case No. 1081-BG through the help of respondent Judge, he was also given the liberty to copy what perhaps would help him in his quest to win the case.\n\nInvoking the principle of res ipsa loquitor , complainant objects to the fact that Civil Case No. 1518-BG was raffled to the respondent Judge, who was the former counsel of the plaintiff therein in Civil Case No. 1081-BG. Another reason for his objection is that, allegedly, some paragraphs in the complaint in Civil Case No. 1518-BG were obviously copied from Civil Case No. 1081-BG wherein the complaint was prepared by respondent Judge in his capacity as then lawyer of herein complainant (plaintiff therein). Complainant claims that the foregoing constitute misconduct which imply malice or wrongful intent, not just mere errors of judgment. He insists that the fact that respondent Judge will try the case upon a complaint in which the plaintiff was his former client and which complaint was copied from the complaint he himself prepared does not speak well of his intention as to the disposition of the case.\n\nComplainant maintains that the act of respondent Judge in allowing the respondent lawyer to copy the complaint in Civil Case No. 1081-BG and to present it to court as the latter's work does violence to Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which provides that a judge should be the embodiment of competence, integrity and independence. Complainant also asserts that in placing his signature in the complaint not written by him, respondent lawyer committed deceit, which serves as a ground for his disbarment.\n\nIn a Resolution dated 28 September 2005, the Second Division of this Court referred the instant administrative case to Court of Appeals Justice Josefina G. Salonga for investigation, report and recommendation within ninety (90) days from receipt thereof.\n\nPursuant thereto, Justice Salonga set the case for hearing on 13 December 2005, and directed the complainant and the respondents, and their witnesses, if any, to appear before her and to submit documents relevant to the complaint.\n\nDuring the scheduled hearing, the complainant and the respondent Judge, after the marking and offering of their respective documentary evidence, manifested that they would not be adducing any further evidence. Upon their motion, they were given a period of thirty (30) days within which to simultaneously file their Memoranda, after which the case will be deemed submitted for resolution.\n\nOn 13 December 2005, complainant filed his Memorandum. The respondent judge, on the other hand, filed his Memorandum on 18 January 2006 while the respondent lawyer filed his Memorandum on 20 January 2006.\n\nIn her report, Justice Salonga summarized the facts as follows:\nIn October 1992, Salud Andrada Marquez ( \"Marquez\" ) mortgaged six (6) parcels of land to the Rural Bank of Luna, La Union, Inc., one of which is a parcel of land with an area of Twenty Two Thousand Five Hundred Ninety Nine Square Meters (22,599 sq. meters) located at Calumbaya, Bauang, La Union covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. FP-15344 under a Free Patent granted on 5 July 1989.\n\nFailing to pay her debt, the bank foreclosed the mortgage. On 2 August 1993, the mortgaged properties were sold at public auction the highest bidder of which was the petitioner. Consequently, OCT No. FP-15344 was cancelled and in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-40223 was issued in the name of the petitioner.\n\nIn the meantime, petitioner, through his attorneys-in-fact Antonio O. Prieto and Monette O. Prieto, mortgaged the aforesaid properties to Far East Bank and Trust Company.\n\nSeeking the nullification of the mortgaged and the consequent transfer of the mortgaged properties in the name of the petitioner, Roque, Marquez' daughter, filed a complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 1081-BG with the RTC Branch 67, for Declaration of Nullity of Contracts with Damages against said petitioner, the Rural Bank of Luna, La Union, Inc. and Far East Bank and Trust Company. Respondent judge, then a practicing lawyer, was retained by Roque as her counsel of record in said case and was the one who drafted said complaint.\n\nOn 18 August 2000, the RTC Branch 67, through then Presiding Judge Jose G. Pineda, issued an order dismissing the case on the ground that Roque was not a real party in interest since her right of action has still to ripen upon the death of her mother.\n\nOn 8 November 2001, respondent judge was appointed as the presiding judge of RTC Branch 67. By reason of his appointment, he completely severed all his professional relationships with his clients, including Roque, and turned over or relinquished all case records of his office to said clients.\n\nUpon the demise of Marquez on 9 August 2002, Roque, who had now acquired by way of succession her mother's right of action to pursue the annulment of contracts executed over the property formerly covered by OCT No. 15344, engaged the legal services of respondent lawyer.\n\nThus, on 5 January 2004, respondent lawyer, as Roque's counsel, filed a complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Contracts, Reconveyance of Property, and Damages against petitioner, his attorneys-in-fact Antonio O. Prieto and Monette O. Prieto, the Rural Bank of Luna, La Union, Inc. and Far East Bank and Trust Company, Inc., now merged with the Bank of the Philippine Islands, before the Regional Trial Court of Bauang, La Union.\n\nOn 7 January 2004, the case, docketed as Civil Case No. 1518-BG, was raffled to the respondent judge. On 8 January 2004, RTC Branch 67, through Atty. Jeovannie C. Ordo\u00f1o, its Branch Clerk of Court, issued summons to the defendants. The summons and copy of the complaint was duly served upon the petitioner on 20 January 2004.\n\nGoing over the individual case folders of the newly raffled cases to his court, respondent judge came across Civil Case No. 1518-BG and discovered that the plaintiff therein was Roque, his former client. Immediately, without going over the allegations of the complaint, the respondent judge issued an Order dated 23 January 2004 inhibiting himself from the case and ordered that the record of said case be transferred to the Regional Trial Court of Bauang, La Union, Branch 33 (\"RTC Branch 33\").\n\nOn 27 January 2004, the Branch Clerk of Court of RTC Branch 67 transmitted the entire record of Civil Case No. 1518-BG to RTC Branch 33 through its Clerk of Court, Atty. Richard T. Domingo, which was duly received by the latter.\n\nOn 30 January 2004, petitioner separately filed with the RTC Branch 67, an Objection to Competency and his Answer to the Complaint. Since the records thereof were already transmitted to RTC Branch 33, RTC Branch 67's Branch Clerk of Court had said pleadings forwarded thereto. Since then, the proceedings in Civil Case No. 1518-BG have been conducted by RTC Branch 33.\n\nIn an Order dated 22 April 2004, after the parties therein filed their Answers and the issues having been joined, Presiding Judge Rose Mary R. Molina-Alim of RTC Branch 33 set the case for pre-trial conference and ordered the submission of the parties' respective pre-trial briefs.\n\nOn 24 May 2004, petitioner filed with the RTC Branch 33 an Amended Answer together with the Authority given by his co-defendants Antonio O. Prieto and Monette O. Prieto, in his favor to appear for and in their behalf, and their Pre-Trial Brief.\n\nIn a Resolution dated 28 September 2005, the Second Division of the Supreme Court referred the instant administrative case to the undersigned for investigation, report and recommendation within ninety (90) days from receipt thereof. A copy of the said Resolution was received by the undersigned on 18 November 2005.\n\nPursuant thereto, in an Order promulgated on 21 November 2005, the undersigned set the case for hearing on 13 December 2005 directing the petitioner and the respondents, and their witnesses, if any, to appear before her and to submit documents relevant to the complaint.\n\nDuring the scheduled hearing, the petitioner and the respondent judge, after the marking and offering of their respective documentary evidence, manifested that they will not be adducing any further evidence. Upon their motion, they were given a period thirty (30) days within which to simultaneously file their Memoranda, after which the case will be deemed submitted for resolution.\n\nOn 13 December 2005, petitioner filed his Memorandum. The respondent judge, on the other hand, filed his Memorandum on 18 January 2006 while the respondent lawyer filed his Memorandum on 20 January 2006. In her report, Justice Salonga recommended the dismissal of the complaint against respondents, and that complainant be admonished for filing the frivolous complaint.\nA reading of the records of this case clearly shows that the present administrative case is unfounded, as it is devoid of factual and legal basis. Stripped of all its verbosity, petitioner's allegations in support of his complaint against the respondents should be treated for what they really are, mere allegations founded on speculation and conjecture. In this connection, it must be stressed that in administrative proceedings, the burden of proof that the respondents committed the act complained of rests on the complainant. Failing in this, the complaint must be dismissed.\n\nFirst off, the allegation of the petitioner to the effect that the respondent lawyer, through the intervention and assistance of the respondent judge, had free access to the court records Civil Case No. 1081-BG fails to find evidentiary support. Without more, petitioner deduced that the court records of Civil Case No. 1081-BG were made available to the respondent lawyer at the instance of the respondent judge simply because relevant and substantial portions of the complaint filed by the latter were re-written and adopted in Civil Case No. 1518-BG. Bare and conclusory as it is, the said allegation deserves scant consideration.\n\nEmphatically, the mere fact that respondent lawyer had adopted relevant and substantial portions of the complaint filed by the respondent judge does not in any way bespeak of any illegal or unethical practice on his part.\n\nFor one, the respondent lawyer could have easily read and gained access to the case record of Civil Case No. 1081-BG. As can be gleaned from the records, respondent judge had already turned over and relinquished his case records of Civil Case No. 1081-BG to Roque after his appointment to the bench on 8 November 2001. Since she intended to re-file the case against petitioner, it is expected, if not necessary, for Roque to give the records of the previously dismissed complaint to her newly retained counsel. What is more apparent is the right of Roque and the respondent lawyer, as her retained counsel, to request access to the court records for their reproduction or certification.\n\nFor another, a perusal of the complaints separately and successively filed by the respondent judge and the respondent lawyer belies petitioner's claim that the latter merely copied, verbatim or otherwise, the original complaint. True, some allegations contained therein were substantially retained by respondent lawyer. However, these allegations are essential and crucial to the cause of action of Roque against the petitioner. Aside from the fact that there is hardly a number of ways to construct a sentence, petitioner cannot plausibly claim that respondent lawyer is legally restrained from retaining or rewriting sentences earlier constructed by the respondent judge.\n\nMore importantly, petitioner's assertion that respondent judge allowed the respondent lawyer to copy the complaint in Civil Case No. 1081-BG is unfounded. Aside from the petitioner's mere say so, there is not even an iota of evidence to support this assertion. It is all too obvious that there is a dearth of evidence that would in any way prove petitioner's accusation against the respondents.\n\nIn the same vein, petitioner's inference that respondent judge intended to try Civil Case No. 1518-BG is a blatant fabrication. The records of the case refute this. Reading his petition, it is evident that petitioner cunningly attempted to mislead this court to believe that respondent judge is still conducting the proceedings in Civil Case No. 1518-BG and had refused to inhibit himself therefrom. His intent to deceive this court to achieve his end to vex and harass the respondents is undeniable.\n\nAs asserted by the respondent judge, petitioner cannot feign ignorance in this regard. He is well aware that the respondent judge already issued an Order dated 23 January 2004 inhibiting himself from the case and ordering the transmission of the record of said case to the RTC Branch 33. In fact, petitioner has been actively participating in the proceedings of said case before the RTC Branch 33 prior to the institution of the instant administrative case as he had already filed several pleadings therewith.\n\nIf truth be told, the allegations in the instant petition was ingeniously written to deliberately and maliciously withhold and suppress the fact that the respondent judge had already inhibited himself from taking cognizance of Civil Case No. 1518-BG and that the records thereof had in fact been transmitted to RTC Branch 33.\n\nAll told, it cannot be gainsaid that the instant administrative case in itself is frivolous, calculated merely to harass, annoy, and cast groundless suspicions on the integrity and reputation of both the respondents. The only piece of evidence that the petitioner has offered in support of his claim is his bare assertions, which certainly deserves scant consideration. It must be emphasized that a mere charge or allegation of wrongdoing does not suffice. Accusation is not synonymous with guilt. There must always be sufficient evidence to support the charge. This brings to the fore the application of the age-old but familiar rule that he who alleges must prove his allegations.\n\nCounter-Petition Against the Petitioner\n\nAdopting the above-findings made in the petition against the respondents, there is merit in the separate counter-petitions filed by the latter to hold the petitioner administratively liable for filing an unfounded and frivolous suit.\n\nAs already stated, petitioner's allegations in support of his complaint against the respondents are baseless, as they are mere allegations founded on pure speculation and conjecture. Sans evidence, his petition was purposely written to mislead the Court and cast a doubt on the integrity and dignity of the respondents. Petitioner made the said administrative case as a vehicle to unduly harass or otherwise prejudice the respondents. Worse, in selfishly satisfying his own desire to vex the respondents, he had tarnished the integrity of the entire judiciary and the bar.\n\nFor this reason, the petitioner should be cited in contempt, as what the Supreme Court had pronounced in the recent case of Galman Cruz vs. Ali\u00f1o-Hormachuelos . Said the Court:\n\"Verily, this Court is once again called upon to reiterate that, although the Court will never tolerate or condone any act, conduct or omission that would violate the norm of public accountability or diminish the peoples' faith in the judiciary, neither will it hesitate to shield those under its employ from unfounded suits that only serve to disrupt rather than promote the orderly administration of justice.\n\nThe eloquent words of the late Justice Conrado V. Sanchez in Rheem of the Philippines vs. Ferrer are enlightening:\n\nBy now, a lawyer's duties to the Court have become commonplace. Really, there could hardly be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof. Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, in categorical terms, spells out one such duty: 'To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.' As explicit is the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that it is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the Court a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.\" That same canon, as corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to support the courts against \"unjust criticism and clamor.\" And more, the attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a conduct that should be \"with all good fidelity...to the courts.\" Worth remembering is that the duty of an attorney to the courts \"can only be maintained by rendering no service involving any disrespect to the judicial office which he is bound to uphold.\"\n\nWe concede that a lawyer may think highly of his intellectual endowment. That is his privilege. And, he may suffer frustration at what he feels is other's lack of it. That is his misfortune. Some such frame of mind, however, should not be allowed to harden into a belief that he may attack a court's decision in words calculated to jettison the time-honored aphorism that courts are the temples of right. He should give due allowance to the fact that judges are but men; and men are encompassed by error, fettered by fallibility.\n\nIn Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel, Justice Sanchez further elucidated:\n\nA lawyer is an officer of the courts; he is. \"like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.\" His duty is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts to which he owes fidelity, \"not to promote distrust in the administration of justice.\" Faith in the courts a lawyer should seek to preserve. For, to undermine the judicial edifice \"is disastrous to the continuity of government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people.\" Thus has it been said of a lawyer that \"as an officer of the court, it is his sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice.\" Petitioner's unfounded imputations against respondents are malicious and offend the dignity of the entire judiciary. Scandalous as his bare allegations are, the fact that petitioner maliciously insinuated that the respondent judge allowed access to and assisted the respondent lawyer in the filing of his complaint desecrates and mocks the integrity of the judiciary. Equally insolent is petitioner's baseless postulations that the respondent judge refused to inhibit himself from Civil Case No. 1518-BG purposely to give leverage to his former client and her lawyer.\n\nMoreover, in filing a frivolous suit against his opposing counsel, petitioner violated Canons 8 and 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which mandates that \"all lawyers must conduct themselves with courtesy, fairness, and candor towards their colleagues and should avoid harassing tactics against opposing counsel\" and commands all lawyers \"to observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice.\"\nWe have reviewed the records, and after careful consideration thereof, we find the conclusions of fact and the recommendations of the Investigator in the above-quoted report to be well-taken and fully supported by the evidence on record, except for the penalty imposed on complainant.\n\nAtty. Marcos V. Prieto must be sanctioned for filing this unfounded complaint. Although no person should be penalized for the exercise of the right to litigate, however, this right must be exercised in good faith. [1]\n\nAs officers of the court, lawyers have a responsibility to assist in the proper administration of justice. They do not discharge this duty by filing frivolous petitions that only add to the workload of the judiciary.\n\nA lawyer is part of the machinery in the administration of justice. Like the court itself, he is an instrument to advance its ends \u2013 the speedy, efficient, impartial, correct and inexpensive adjudication of cases and the prompt satisfaction of final judgments. A lawyer should not only help attain these objectives but should likewise avoid unethical or improper practices that impede, obstruct or prevent their realization, charged as he is with the primary task of assisting in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. [2]\nCanon 12 [3] of the Code of Professional Responsibility promulgated on 21 June 1988 is very explicit that lawyers must exert every effort and consider it their duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.\n\nThe practice of law is a sacred and noble profession. It is limited to persons of good moral character with special qualifications duly ascertained and certified. The right does not only presuppose in its possessor integrity, legal standing and attainment, but also the exercise of a special privilege, highly personal and partaking of the nature of a public trust. [4] Thus, a lawyer should not use his knowledge of law as an instrument to harass a party nor to misuse judicial processes, as the same constitutes serious transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility. [5] We cannot countenance complainant's act of misleading this Court into believing that respondent judge was still conducting the proceedings in Civil Case No. 1518-BG. What is evident is that even complainant was well aware of respondent judge's inhibition therefrom. The respondent judge, in fact, issued an Order dated 23 January 2004 inhibiting himself from the case.\n\nIn Retuya v. Gorduiz , [6] respondent-lawyer was suspended for six (6) months for filing a groundless suit against a former client in order to harass and embarrass her. In the case of Arnaldo v. Suarin , [7] complainant Atty. Arnaldo was fined P5,000.00 for filing frivolous complaint. In this case, which we find analogous to Arnaldo , we hold that a fine of P5,000.00 will suffice.\n\nACCORDINGLY , the above-quoted report of Justice Salonga is APPROVED with modification as to the penalty imposed on complainant Atty. Marcos V. Prieto. Respondents Judge Ferdinand A. Fe and Atty. Oscar B. Corpuz are exonerated and the administrative complaint against them is DISMISSED . Complainant Atty. Marcos V. Prieto is FINED P5,000.00 for filing frivolous suit with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez, and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Duduaco v.

NALLOS, CLERK II, AND LUCIA SANTILLAN, STENOGRAPHER, ALL OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, SILAY CITY, RESPONDENTS\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nSANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:\n\nFor our resolution is the verified administrative Complaint [1] filed by Mary Ann C. Ito against the following: (1) Atty. Eric B. De Vera, clerk of court VI and ex-officio sheriff, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Silay City; (2) May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as, legal researcher; (3) Mae Vercille H. Nallos, clerk II; and (4) Vicente V. Quinicot, sheriff IV, all employees of RTC, Branch 40, Silay City. They are charged with dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Later, Lucia Santillan, stenographer of same court, was charged with dereliction of duty. These charges stemmed from Cadastral Case No. 186-40, entitled \"Mary Ann C. Ito v. Spouses Analyn Nishio and Shigeo Nishio,\" for issuance of a writ of possession filed with the said court.\n\nMary Ann Ito alleged in her complaint that on March 25, 1998, spouses Analyn and Shigeo Nishio borrowed money from her. To secure the loan, they mortgaged to her their parcel of land situated in Barangay Mambulac, Silay City. The parties agreed that the obligation would be paid on or before March 25, 1999. On February 2, 1999, complainant left for Japan.\nComplaint against Eric de Vera, clerk of court, for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and his comment -- Complainant alleged that on May 11, 1999, while she was in Japan, respondent Eric De Vera went to her residence in Barangay Mambulac, Silay City and told her aunt, Julieta Alve, to call her as he has a very important thing to say. During their telephone conversation, respondent advised complainant to immediately file a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage as spouses Nishio are planning to sell the mortgaged property. When she replied that she cannot file the petition as she is still in Japan, respondent told her that there will be no problem provided she gives him the amount of P13,040.00 for the filing fee, publication fee, and sheriff's expenses. Immediately, upon complainant's instruction, her aunt delivered the amount to him.\n\nWhen complainant arrived in Silay City on May 18, 1999, she found that respondent had not yet filed the petition for extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage. Upon her inquiry, he advised her to give spouses Nishio a chance to settle their obligation. Complainant then came to know that Analyn Nishio is the cousin of respondent's wife. It was only after she demanded him to return her money, or on June 28, 1999, that respondent finally filed the petition. Being the sole and highest bidder in the foreclosure proceeding, complainant was declared the highest bidder and eventually, a Certificate of Sale was issued to her by the sheriff.\n\nOn August 17, 1999, complainant filed with the same court a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession. Again, respondent pleaded to her not to take possession of the mortgaged property.\n\nOn September 27, 1999, the trial court granted complainant's petition. Spouses Nishio filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied.\n\nIn respondents' Consolidated Comment [2] on the instant complaint, respondent Eric De Vera admitted having visited the house of complainant but only for the purpose of serving on her a notice of hearing in Civil Case No. 2059 she filed against Judge Antonio L. Jayubo of the Metropolitan Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Silay City. While there, complainant's aunt sought his advice about the unpaid loan of spouses Nishio. Respondent informed her that the mortgage can be foreclosed. A few days after, she informed him that complainant wants the mortgage foreclosed. Complainant's aunt asked him to determine the expenses involved. So he sent her an itemized list amounting to P13,040.00. Later, complainant's aunt delivered to him this amount .\nComplaint against Vicente Quinicot, sheriff, for dereliction of duty and his comment \u2013 Complainant requested respondent Vicente Quinicot to serve the writ of possession on spouses Nishio. However, he refused because the case is \"troublesome.\" This constrained complainant's lawyer [3] to write respondent May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as, officer-in-charge of Branch 40, to endorse the writ to the sheriff of RTC, Bacolod City for implementation.\n\nIn his comment, respondent claimed that he could not immediately implement the writ of possession because he had to wait for the finality of the Order directing the issuance of the writ.\nComplaint against May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as, legal researcher, and Mae Vercille H. Nallos, clerk II, for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and their joint comment \u2013 Complainant alleged that on November 22, 1999, she learned that Atty. Francisco Alisan, counsel for spouses Nishio, received a copy of the Order denying his motion for reconsideration on November 7, 1999. However, upon verification of the records, it appeared that Atty. Alisan received a copy of the said Order, not on November 7, 1999 but, on November 8. When she complained about this to respondent Mae Vercille H. Nallos, in charge of the record of the subject cadastral case, the latter replied that the change was approved by her superior, respondent May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as. Complainant claimed that respondents committed falsification.\n\nIn their joint comment, both respondents explained that November 7, 1999 was a Sunday. Therefore, the Order could not have been served upon Atty. Alisan that day. They attached to their comment the affidavit dated February 10, 2000 of respondent Lucia Santillan, court stenographer, stating that she was personally present when respondent Nallos gave a copy of the Order to Atty. Alisan on November 8, 1999. There was thus no falsification when the date of receipt was changed to let the document reflect the true and correct date of its receipt by Atty. Alisan.\nComplaint against Lucia Santillan, court stenographer and her comment \u2013 Complainant also claimed that when she asked respondent Lucia Santillan how the Order could be served upon Atty. Alisan, she answered that it can be served personally even on a holiday, Saturday or Sunday, for a fee of P500.00. Because of her assurances, complainant handed Lucia the amount. The Order was then personally served on Atty. Alisan on said date.\n\nUpon recommendation of then Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo, the Court, on March 21, 2001, issued a Resolution directing that the case be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter; that respondent Lucia Santillan, court stenographer, be impleaded as additional respondent and to require her to comment on the allegations against her; and that the case be referred to Executive Judge Reynaldo M. Alon, RTC, Silay City, for investigation, report and recommendation within 60 days from notice.\n\nIn her comment, respondent Lucia Santillan vehemently denied she received P500.00 from complainant. Being a stenographer, she has no business interfering in the work of a sheriff.\n\nBefore Executive Judge Alon could start his investigation, the complainant filed a Motion To Withdraw Complaint stating that for personal reasons, she is no longer interested in prosecuting this case against respondents.\n\nExecutive Judge Alon set the hearing of this case on June 18 and 20, 2001. During the June 18, 2001 initial hearing, all the parties appeared. Complainant reiterated her motion to withdraw the complaint, manifesting that she is fully aware of the consequences of such withdrawal.\n\nIn view of complainant's desistance from pursuing the complaint, Executive Judge Alon, in his Investigation Report, recommended the dismissal of the administrative charges against all respondents.\n\nAfter evaluating the Investigation Report of Executive Judge Alon, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) issued a Memorandum [4] recommending that the administrative charges against respondents May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as, Vicente V. Quinicot, Mae Vercille H. Nallos, and Lucia Santillan be dismissed for lack of merit. However, the OCA found respondent Eric De Vera guilty of misconduct in office and recommended that he be fined in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00).\n\nThe OCA found that:\nThe charge against respondent clerk of court Eric de Vera basically pertains to his alleged act of soliciting the amount of P13,040.00 supposedly representing the expenses for the foreclosure of the property mortgaged to herein complainant. Respondent admitted having received the amount but sought to exonerate himself from liability by claiming that the same was for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the foreclosure proceedings. This is without merit. First, it is inconceivable that respondent, with all his duties and responsibilities as clerk of court would still find time to serve a notice in connection with any case pending before the RTC of Silay City, not to mention the fact that there are several sheriffs and process servers in the Office of the Clerk of Court and the RTC branches who could serve the notice. Second, granting that the amount of P13,040.00 was given to defray the expenses of the foreclosure proceedings, the manner by which the amount was paid is highly questionable. The payment was made at complainant's house and no receipt, official or otherwise, was issued by respondent.\n\nx x x\n\nIn the case of respondent sheriff Vicente Quinicot, complainant did not present any evidence that the writ of possession had been placed in the hands of said sheriff for implementation when he allegedly refused to serve the same. In fact, not even a copy of the writ of possession had been submitted by complainant. There is thus merit in respondent's claim that at the time complainant requested the service of the writ to spouses Nishio, only the order for the issuance of the writ, not the writ itself, had been issued.\n\nWith respect to respondents May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as and Mae Vercille Nallos, the charge of misconduct for \"falsifying\" the date of receipt by Atty. Alisan of the Order denying his motion for reconsideration is without merit. It must be pointed out that the change was done in order to correct a mistake in the date written by Atty. Alisan and to thus allow the document to reflect the true date of receipt of the Order. It was not a case of altering a correct entry in order to create a deception or falsity. The claim that Atty. Alisan personally received the Order on 7 November 1999, which is a Sunday, is of doubtful veracity. Personal service of court processes are not made on weekends, especially on Sundays, because the court is not open on those days.\n\nFinally, in the case of respondent Lucia Santillan, it is worth noting that she was not included in the original complaint. Allegations against her were made by complainant only after she executed an affidavit to support the contentions of respondents Las Pi\u00f1as and Nallos in their comment. It is thus highly probable that, as claimed by Santillan herself, she was included in complainant's rejoinder only in retaliation as a result of her affidavit. The OCA is correct in disregarding the Investigating Judge's recommendation dismissing the administrative charges against all respondents on the basis of complainant's desistance to prosecute her case. In a long line of cases, we have ruled that mere withdrawal of the administrative charges by complainant does not necessarily result in the dismissal of the complaint [5] and will not free respondent from his administrative liability if warranted by the evidence. [6] For administrative actions are not made to depend upon the will of the complainant who, for one reason or another, condones a detestable act. [7] The Court is not bound by the unilateral act of a complainant who desists from prosecuting a case involving the discipline of respondents under its administrative supervision. [8]\n\nThe complaint against respondents May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as, Vicente Quinicot, Mae Vercille Nallos, and Lucia Santillan should be dismissed. As correctly found by the OCA, quoted earlier, complainant failed to substantiate her charges against them.\n\nWith respect to respondent Eric De Vera, the charges against him relate to his act of soliciting from complainant P13,040.00 representing the expenses for the foreclosure of the mortgaged. We agree with the OCA that his defense is not credible. Indeed, we find it hard to accept his claim that he went to complainant's house, not to solicit the said amount but, merely to serve on her the notice of hearing in Civil Case No. 2059 she filed against Judge Antonio L. Jayubo of the MTCC, Silay City. It is not the duty of a clerk of court, like him, to go out of his way and serve such notice upon the complainant considering that there are sheriffs and process servers to perform such function. Besides, if indeed, as he claimed, the P13,040.00 was intended to defray the expenses for the foreclosure proceedings, why did he receive the amount at complainant's residence; and why did he not issue the corresponding official receipts?\n\nRespondent Eric De Vera's actuation undermines the people's faith in the judiciary. He is reminded that the delicate nature of work of those involved in the administration of justice, from the highest judicial official to the lowest personnel, requires them to live up to the strictest standard of honesty, integrity and uprightness, [9] in order to maintain public confidence in the judiciary. [10] The image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct of its personnel. It is their sacred duty to maintain the good name and standing of the court as a true temple of justice. [11]\n\nTime and again, this Court has emphasized the heavy burden and responsibility of court personnel. They have been constantly reminded that any impression of impropriety, misdeed or negligence in the performance of their official functions must be avoided. [12] Thus, the Court does not hesitate to condemn and sanction such improper conduct, act or omission of those involved in the administration of justice that violates the norm of public accountability and diminishes or tends to diminish the faith of the public in the Judiciary [13]\n\nWe find respondent Eric De Vera guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Under Section 52, paragraph A - 20, Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules On Administrative Cases In The Civil Service, [14] such offense is classified as grave, punishable as follows:\nConduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service\n\n1st offense \u2013 Suspension (6 mos. 1 day to 1 year)\n\n2nd offense \u2013 Dismissal The Civil Service law and rules, however, do not make a concrete description of what specific acts constitute such offense. [15] Our jurisprudence, though, is instructive on this point. We have considered the following acts or omissions, inter alia , as conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service : misappropriation of public funds, abandonment of office, failure to report back to work without prior notice, [16] failure to safe keep public records and property, [17] and making false entries in public documents and falsification of court orders. [18] Undoubtedly, these acts or omissions, like respondent's conduct, violate the norm of public accountability and diminish or tend to diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary, thereby prejudicing the best interest of the administration of justice.\n\nThis being respondent Eric De Vera's first offense, he must be penalized with suspension of seven (7) months.\n\nWHEREFORE , respondent Eric B. De Vera , clerk of court VI, RTC, Silay City, is declared GUILTY of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and is SUSPENDED for SEVEN (7) MONTHS without pay . He is sternly warned that a repetition of the same act will be dealt with more severely.\n\nThe complaint against May Nene Las Pi\u00f1as, legal researcher; Vicente V. Quinicot, sheriff IV; Mae Vercille H. Nallos, clerk II; and Lucia Santillan, court stenographer III, all of Branch 40, RTC, Silay City is DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nLet a copy of this Decision be entered into respondent De Vera's personal file.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Corona, Azcuna, and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Dated November 26, 1999.\n\n[2] Dated March 27, 2000; Rollo , pp. 67-75.\n\n[3] See Annex \"J.\"\n\n[4] Submitted by Deputy Court Administrator Zenaida N.

CABAHUG, CLERK OF COURT V, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 56, MANDAUE CITY, RESPONDENT. R E S O L U T I O N\nSAGA DESIGN, INC., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. EMELINE B. CABAHUG, CLERK OF COURT V, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 56, MANDAUE CITY, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nThe instant administrative case stemmed from a verified complaint dated December 9, 2005 filed with the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) by complainant Saga Design, Inc., through its representative, Benson Chua, charging the herein respondent, Atty. Emeline B. Cabahug , Branch Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 56, Mandaue City, with violation of the norm of conduct of public servants and arbitrariness and capriciousness in connection with the pre-marking of exhibits conducted by the respondent in Civil Case No. Man-4500, entitled Saga Design, Inc. v. New Times Limited Philippines, et al.\n\nThe facts:\n\nRecord shows that complainant Saga Design, Inc., is the plaintiff in Civil Case No. Man-4500 pending before Branch 56 of the RTC, Mandaue City since December 2003. Pursuant to the new rules on pre-trial, the parties to the case and the respondent branch clerk of court agreed to have the pre-marking of exhibits on November 18, 2005.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, complainant's representative, Benson Chua, and its counsel, Atty. Francis M. Zosa, arrived at the office of the respondent at around 2:25 p.m. only to be informed that the respondent was attending her child's school function and that the scheduled pre-marking of exhibits had been reset to December 9, 2005, at 3:00 p.m.\n\nOn December 9, 2005, Chua and Atty. Zosa arrived at the respondent's office at about 3:13 p.m., which was only 13 minutes past the scheduled time. Inasmuch as by then, the defendants' representatives and counsel had already left, the respondent informed the two that she had agreed to reset the pre-marking of exhibits to January 25, 2006. Atty. Zosa refused to sign the re-setting because the case had been pending for two (2) years already.\n\nTo the complainant, the act of the respondent in unilaterally canceling the scheduled pre-marking of exhibits on November 18, 2005, violated the norm of conduct of public servants who should not put public service above personal consideration. It also averred that the respondent's act in agreeing to reset the pre-marking of exhibits just because complainant's representative and counsel were late by a few minutes constituted arbitrariness, capriciousness and contributed to the delay in the resolution of its case.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the then Court Administrator required the respondent to file her comment on the complaint, which she did on February 21, 2006.\n\nIn her comment, the respondent admitted having scheduled the pre-marking of exhibits on November 18, 2005 at 2:30 p.m. She explained, however, that at around 2:00 p.m. of that date, she received a call from her child's teacher asking her to go to the school as the guidance counselor wanted to have a talk with her about a very important matter concerning her child. With the permission of her presiding judge, she immediately proceeded to her child's school. On her way, she remembered the scheduled pre-marking of exhibits in Civil Case No. Man-4500. She then called up her officemate, Ana A\u00f1ana, instructing her to ask the parties, through counsels, if they could wait until 3:30 p.m. A\u00f1ana, however, told her that the counsels of both parties agreed to reset the pre-marking of exhibits to December 9, 2005.\n\nOn December 9, 2005, the counsel for the defendant Atty. Joseph Randi C. Torregosa and defendant Marivic Debolusan, arrived at the respondent's office at around 2:20 p.m., while the plaintiff's representative, Benson Chua, and its counsel, Atty. Zosa arrived at 3:30 p.m. By then, the defendant's counsel, and Debolusan had already left, with the scheduled pre-marking of exhibits reset to January 25, 2006. Atty. Zosa was furious upon being informed of the resetting and walked out from the respondent's office.\n\nUltimately, on motion of the plaintiff's representative, the pre-marking of exhibits was conducted and completed on January 5, 2006.\n\nIn its Memorandum Report, the OCA recommended that respondent be suspended for one (1) month and one (1) day for simple neglect of duty, saying, inter alia , thus:\nIn this case, respondent admitted to have tasked to conduct the pre-marking of exhibits in Civil Case No. Man-4500. Accordingly, she set the date for such exercise on November 18, 2005, and the parties, together, with their counsels, were duly notified therefor. At the appointed time of the pre-marking of exhibits, however, respondent hurriedly left her office to attend to a school function for her child, conveniently forgetting the task she had earlier set on that day. The parties and their counsels were, thus, left with no choice but to work out by themselves the resetting of the scheduled pre-marking of exhibits, thereby causing delay in the proceeding of the case.\n\nRespondent's excuse that she sought permission from her presiding judge to go to her child's school does not alter the fact that she failed to give proper attention to a task she herself scheduled and of which she was expected to perform. As clerk of court, respondent is expected to act speedily on her assigned task to avoid clogging of cases in court and thereby assist in the administration of justice without delay. Corollarily, under the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel, court employees are required at all times to perform their official duties properly and with diligence, and to commit themselves exclusively to the business and responsibilities of their office during working hours. Consequently, respondent's negligence in the performance of her duties warrants disciplinary action.\n\nWith respect to the alleged capricious and arbitrary resetting of the pre-marking of exhibits from December 9, 2005 to January 25, 2006, complainant's representative's own admission of arriving late on December 9, 2005 belies its accusation. The resetting was not meant to prejudice complainant but was prompted by the latter's representative's failure to arrive on time. Defendants and their counsels could not have been expected to wait beyond the scheduled time of the pre-marking of exhibits as they may have been saddled with other equally important appointments on that day. The OCA's recommendation and the premises holding it together commend our approval. Respondent is guilty of simple neglect of duty, which has been defined as the failure of an employee to give attention to a task expected of him, and signifies a disregard of duty resulting from carelessness or indifference. [1]\n\nAs branch clerk of court, respondent is the administrative assistant of the presiding judge. As such, the presiding judge may, before the start of the pre-trial conference, refer the case to the branch clerk of court for a preliminary conference to assist the parties in reaching a settlement, to mark documents or exhibits to be presented by the parties and copies thereof to be attached to the records after comparison and to consider such other matters as may aid in the prompt disposition of the case. [2] Here, respondent admitted that she was tasked to conduct the pre-marking of exhibits in Civil Case No. Man-4500, and set the date for such exercise, with notices given to both parties and their counsels. But, as it was, she was negligent in her duty. Her actuation casts suspicion on the integrity of the court and affected the efficiency of the process of administration of justice.\n\nRespondent should be the role model of her co-employees to act speedily and with dispatch on assigned tasks to avoid the clogging of the court's docket, and thereby assist in the administration of justice without undue delay. She should be reminded that prompt disposition of the court's business and expeditious disposition of cases can be attained only through efficient case-flow management by the judge and his personnel, especially the branch clerk. Considering that the main case has already been pending for more than two (2) years, respondent should, with more reason, exert extra effort to have the case resolved.\n\nTime and again, we have emphasized the heavy burden and responsibility with which court personnel are saddled in view of their exalted positions as keepers of public faith. They must be constantly reminded that any impression of impropriety, misdeed or negligence in the performance of official functions must be avoided. We condemn and would never countenance any conduct, act or omission, on the part of all those involved in the administration of justice, which would violate the norms of public accountability and diminish, or even just tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the Judiciary. [3]\n\nSimple neglect of duty is a less grave offense punishable by suspension of one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months. [4]\n\nHowever, it appearing that this is the respondent's first offense, and consistent with Civil Service Rules and current jurisprudence [5] on the subject and to prevent any undue adverse effect on the public service should respondent be meted the penalty of suspension, the Court deems it best to merely penalize her with a fine equivalent to her one month salary, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Emeline B. Cabahug , Branch Clerk of Court, RTC, Branch 56, Mandaue City, GUILTY of simple neglect of duty, and imposes upon her a FINE equivalent to her one-month salary, with a WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.\nCorona, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Zarate v.

P-06-2124, December 19, 2006 ]\n\nREPORT ON THE STATUS OF THE FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT,\nTARLAC CITY\nD E C I S I O N\nREPORT ON THE STATUS OF THE FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT,\nTARLAC CITY\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis involves a financial audit by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) conducted in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tarlac City.\n\nThe audit of the books of accounts of Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero, Clerk of Court of RTC, Tarlac City, disclosed that:\n1) Official receipts with serial nos. 8984951-8984976 remain unaccounted; and\n\n2) Reconciliation of the fiduciary fund disclosed an unaccounted amount of P6,953,714.77. [1]\nSeveral violations were likewise committed with regard to the implementation of court circulars on the timely deposit of court collections, as the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) collections from 18 to 23 November 2003 amounting to P167,835.91 were deposited only on 1 December 2003, as well as on the use of the court collections to encash personal checks. [2]\n\nClerk of Court Atty. Tuquero disputed the findings and instead ascribed liability to Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera, the cash clerk. However, due to the principle of command responsibility and being the one primarily accountable, Atty. Tuquero was required to submit the necessary documents to justify the unaccounted amount of P6,953,714.77. Atty. Tuquero's clearance was held in abeyance in the meantime, resulting in the delay in the release of his retirement benefits . [3]\n\nA final submission of compliance was made on 18 October 2005 and both Atty. Tuquero and Mr. Manguera requested that the remaining unaccounted amount be divided equally between them and the same to be deducted from their respective money value of leave credits. [4] Moreover, Mr. Manguera intimated that while he may have incurred delay in the deposit of court collections, he has not taken a single centavo from the court's money. He likewise claimed that the filing and keeping of the records were also not properly maintained because of the lack of available storage space. This deficiency, he asserted, has contributed to the loss of some documents. [5]\n\nAfter considering the documents presented, the established accountability was reduced to P573, 047.04, the composition of which is as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nParticulars | Amount\nUnauthorized withdrawals | P235,500.00*\nInterest transferred to RTC-Paniqui | 24,705.25**\nBalance of Beginning Inventory | 146,124.36***\nUnidentified Withdrawals | 169,750.00****\nOverwithdrawal of interest | 467.43*****\nOver deposit | 3,500.00******\nTOTAL | 573,047.04\n[END_TABLE]\n\nParticulars Amount Unauthorized withdrawals P235,500.00* Interest transferred to RTC-Paniqui 24,705.25** Balance of Beginning Inventory 146,124.36*** Unidentified Withdrawals 169,750.00**** Overwithdrawal of interest 467.43***** Over deposit 3,500.00****** TOTAL 573,047.04\n* Withdrawals which have no supporting documents, i.e., acknowledgment receipt and court order\n\n** Interest for cash bond deposited with RTC-Tarlac City but withdrawn together with the principal amount in violation of SC Circular No. 50-95\n\n*** Beginning inventory which appeared in the SL of Accounting but without details. Allegedly deposited with the Provincial Treasurer's Office (PTO) but the accountable officer was not able to present the official receipts issued by the PTO as proof of deposit.\n\n**** Withdrawals appearing in the passbook but could not be identified for lack of necessary documents.\n\n***** Interest on fiduciary fund deposits which was withdrawn without deducting the withholding tax\n\n****** Deposits exceeded the collections. [6]\nYet, Atty. Tuquero and Mr. Manguera could no longer account for the missing official receipts.\n\nOn 22 November 2005, the OCA submitted to then Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., a Report on the status of the Financial Audit conducted in the RTC of Tarlac City. The OCA found that Atty. Tuquero failed to perform his duties and functions as an accountable officer, especially his duty to monitor the financial transactions in the court. It also found that Mr. Manguera failed to deposit court collections on time and used court collections to encash personal checks. [7]\n\nIn our Resolution [8] dated 30 January 2006, we adopted the OCA's recommendation, quoted as follows:\n(a) to DIVIDE the shortage amounting to Five Hundred Seventy Two Thousand Five Hundred Seventy Nine Pesos and Sixty-One Centavos (P572,579.61) equally between Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero and Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera and to ALLOW the same to deducted from the money value of their respective leave credits;\n\n(b) to DEPOSIT the said amount (P572,579.61) in the Fiduciary Fund Account of RTC-Tarlac City (LBP SA#0071-0925-42) subject to refund to Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero and Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera upon submission of the required documents;\n\n(c) to DIRECT :\n\n(1) Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero to deposit the amount of P467.43 (amount of the interest overwithdrawn) to the Fiduciary Fund Account maintained by the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac City; and\n(2) Atty. Shalane Go-Palomar to assist Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero and Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera in complying with the unsubmitted documents; and\n\n(d)to RE-DOCKET this case as a regular administrative complaint against Roberto Q. Tuquero and Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera and to impose upon them a FINE in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) each, in the case of Atty. Tuquero, for his failure to perform his duties and functions as [an] accountable officer-specially his failure to monitor the financial transactions in the court and, that of Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera, for his failure to deposit court collections on time and for using of court collections in encashing personal checks. [9]\nIn our Resolution [10] dated 25 September 2006, the Court clarified that in issuing the above-cited Resolution, we merely intended to take note of and approve only recommendations of the OCA, to wit: (a) that the shortage of P572,579.61 be divided equally between Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero and Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera, to be deducted from the money value of their leave credits, (b) that the amount of P572,579.61 be deposited in the Fiduciary Fund Account of the RTC-Tarlac City subject to refund to Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero and Mr. Honorato Q. Manguera upon submission of the required documents; (c) that Atty. Roberto Q. Tuquero deposit the amount of interest overwithdrawn totaling P467.43 to the Fiduciary Fund account of the RTC, Tarlac City; and (d) that the Report be redocketed as a regular administrative complaint.\n\nThe Court never intended to rule on the question on the administrative liability of the respondents. For this reason, the Court in said resolution required respondents to comment on the recommendation of the OCA that each of them be fined. Thus, the Court in its Resolution dated 25 September 2006 required respondents to manifest their willingness to submit the case for resolution based on the pleadings filed. [11]\n\nAtty. Tuquero filed his Manifestation [12] dated 23 October 2006 stating that he has no objection to the recommendation of the OCA that he and Mr. Manguera be fined. He likewise manifested that he had already settled the fine imposed on him. Mr. Manguera similarly filed his Manifestation [13] dated 24 October 2006 stating his willingness to submit the case for resolution.\n\nThe evidence shows that Atty. Tuquero and Mr. Manguera incurred a total shortage of Five Hundred Seventy Two Thousand Five Hundred Seventy Nine Pesos and Sixty-One Centavos (P572,579.61).\n\nEven if said amount was restituted, nonetheless, its non-remittance on time deprived the Court of the interest that may be earned if the amounts were deposited in a bank as prudently required. Pertinently, Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 provides:\nx x x x\n\n3. Duty of the Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge or Accountable Officers. \u2013The Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Courts, or their accountable duly authorized representatives designated by them in writing, who must be accountable officers, shall receive the Judiciary Development Fund collections, issue the proper receipt therefor, maintain a separate cash book properly marked CASH BOOK FOR JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND, deposit such collections in the manner herein prescribed, and render the proper Monthly Report of Collections for said Fund.\n\nx x x x\n\n3. Systems and Procedures:\n\nx x x x\n\n(c) In the RTC, MeTC, MCTC, SDC and SCC. \u2014The daily collections for the Fund in these courts shall be deposited everyday with the local or nearest LBP branch for the account of the Judiciary Development Fund, Supreme Court, Manila \u2013 SAVINGS ACCOUNT No. 0591-0116-34; or if depositing daily is not possible, deposits for the Fund shall be at the end of every month, provided, however, that whenever the collections for the Fund shall reach P500.00, the same shall be deposited immediately even before the days above-indicated:\n\nx x x x\n\nCollections shall not be used for encashments of personal checks, salary checks, etc. Only Cash, Cashier's Check and Manager's Check are acceptable payments.\n\nx x x x Correlatively, Supreme Court Circular No. 50-95 [14] mandates that \"all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited within twenty four (24) hours by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof.\"\n\nAs clerk of court and cash clerk respectively, Atty. Tuquero and Mr. Manguera are accountable officers entrusted with great responsibility of collecting money belonging to the funds of the court. Both have been remiss in their duty to remit the collections within a prescribed period and are liable for keeping funds in their custody\u2014Tuquero as the one responsible for monitoring the court's financial transactions and Manguera as the one in whom such functions are reposed. Atty. Tuquero and Mr. Manguera violated the trust reposed in them as disbursement officers of the judiciary. Thus, they should be held liable for the shortages mentioned above. Moreover, as held in Re: Financial Audit of Accounts of Clerk of Court Pacita T. Sendin , [15] shortages in the amount to be remitted as well as the delay in the actual remittance constitute neglect of duty for which the responsible officers shall be administratively liable. [16]\n\nClerks of courts should be reminded that they are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts. They are judicial officers entrusted to perform delicate functions with regard to the collection of fees and are expected to correctly and effectively implement regulations such that even undue delay in the remittances of amounts collected by them at the very least constitutes misfeasance. Being the custodian of the court's funds and revenues, records, property and premises, the Clerk of Court is likewise liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of said funds and property. [17]\n\nIn Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao Del Norte , [18] we held that failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds collected to the Municipal Treasurer constitutes gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Under Rule IV, Section 52-A of the Civil Service Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, these are grave offenses punishable by dismissal even committed for the first time.\n\nHowever, considering that both Attys. Tuquero and Manguera had retired from the service, we find the Court Administrator's recommended penalty of P5,000.00 fine on both Atty. Tuquero and Mr. Manguera in order.\n\nWHEREFORE, retired Clerk of Court Roberto Q. Tuquero and Honorato Q. Manguera are each FINED in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) and ordered to jointly and equally restitute the shortage in the collections in the total amount of P572,579.61.\n\nThe Financial Management Office is DIRECTED to DEDUCT equally from Roberto Q. Tuquero and Honorato Q. Manguera's money value of their leave credits the sum of Five Hundred Seventy\n\nTwo Thousand Five Hundred Seventy Nine Pesos and Sixty-One Centavos (P572,579.61).\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio-Morales, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 3.\n\n[2] Id. at 3.\n\n[3] Atty.

NO. 02-6-373-RTC), December 06, 2006 ]\n\nRE: REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 134, MAKATI CITY \nRESOLUTION\nRE: REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 134, MAKATI CITY\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nQUISUMBING, J.:\n\nThis administrative matter stemmed from the judicial audit and inventory of cases conducted in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 134, presided by Judge Ignacio M. Capulong who was to retire on July 21, 2002.\n\nThe report of the judicial audit team of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) [1] disclosed that as of March 2002, RTC Branch 134, had an inventory of one hundred seventy nine (179) civil and criminal cases; and that there were two cases due for promulgation and seven cases already submitted for decision.\n\nIn addition, the audit team noted that there were cases listed in the RTC's docket inventory for July to December 2001 which were not audited, and there were cases that were audited but not listed in the said docket inventory.\n\nOn the recommendation of the OCA, this Court issued a resolution dated August 5, 2002 directing Atty. Leilia R. Llanes, Clerk of Court V of RTC Branch 134, to:\n(a) INFORM t he Court [through] the Office of the Court Administrator within five (5) [days] from notice, whether the decision in Criminal Case No. 99-1398 has been promulgated as scheduled and Criminal Case Nos. 99-728-29, 90-474-75 and Civil Case Nos. 97-970, 90-1277 and 93-2089 were decided within the reglementary period and the pending motions in Civil Case Nos. 99-1171, 98-1797, 00-1497, 01-919, 01-1312, 01-1689, 02-067, 02-019 and 01-1058 were resolved within the period, and SUBMIT within the same period, copies of the decisions and resolutions on the said cases;\n\n(b) SUBMIT a report on (sic) within five [5] days from notice, the latest status of the following cases: Criminal Case Nos. 99-1689, 01-2469, 01-203-204 and 01-2748, Civil Case Nos. 97-2785, 98-1048, 98-2089, 98-2505, 99-1211, 99-1450, 99-1611, 00-218, 00-321, 00-1360, 00-792, 00-957, 00-143, 01-276, 01-979, 01-1104, 01-1325, 01-484 and 01-1632, and EXPLAIN why the said cases were not presented to the audit team despite the directive to produce the records of all cases pending before said branch; and\n\n(c) RECONCILE the Semestral Docket Inventory Report for July to December 2001 by incorporating the following cases: Criminal Case Nos. 97-254, 00-446, 01-1014, Civil Case Nos. 90-1277, 01-919, 01-484, 00-284, 00-173, 01-1705, 00-698, 00-143, 95-624, 99-2122, 01-1632, 01-972, 01-1762, 00-792, 97-441, 98-1360, 99-1278, 98-2620, 98-1630 and 00-218. [2] In a letter dated September 13, 2002, Atty. Llanes submitted to the OCA the list of the cases and their status. Atty. Llanes explained that some cases were not presented to the audit team because they were no longer on active status, i.e. , they were decided, dismissed or archived, while two cases were not presented because the folders were with Judge Capulong for his review and signature. Further, Atty. Llanes manifested that she had complied with the reconciliation of the docket inventory for the second semester of 2001.\n\nThe OCA, in its Memorandum [3] dated May 6, 2003, found that Judge Capulong should be held administratively liable for failing to decide six cases within the reglementary period for deciding cases. But taking into consideration his poor health as mitigating circumstance to his inability to perform his judicial duties, the OCA recommended the imposition only of P5,000 fine.\n\nFurther, the OCA found that Atty. Llanes failed to include Criminal Case No. 01-1014 in the Docket Inventory Report for July to December 2001. For such failure, the OCA recommended that Atty. Llanes be directed to explain her failure.\n\nIn a Resolution dated July 28, 2003, this Court directed Atty. Llanes to explain within 15 days from receipt of the resolution why she failed to include Criminal Case No. 01-1014 in the docket inventory for the second semester of 2001. [4]\n\nFollowing Atty. Llanes's failure to comply with the abovecited directive, this Court issued a Resolution [5] dated September 14, 2005 requiring her to show cause why she should not be disciplinary dealt with or held in contempt for her failure to comply with the July 28, 2003 Resolution.\n\nOn November 3, 2005, Atty. Llanes manifested that she already resigned from the judiciary on October 2, 2002 and was employed with the Department of Justice as Assistant City Prosecutor. She claimed that the July 28, 2003 Resolution was received by Branch 134 on September 1, 2003 when she had left. Further she only learned of the July 28, 2003 Resolution after a staff of Branch 134 called her.\n\nAtty. Llanes averred that she could no longer remember the circumstances that led to the non-inclusion of Criminal Case No. 01-1014 in the inventory since it had been more than two years already. She asked to be excused for her failure was inadvertent and unintentional since in the succeeding inventory report, the case was included. She asked to be excused considering her heavy work load then.\n\nAfter review of the records, the OCA recommended that the instant case be re-docketed as an administrative matter against Atty. Llanes and that she be reprimanded for simple neglect of duty. The OCA also said her heavy work load and resignation from the judiciary were not acceptable excuses. [6]\n\nNow before us, two administrative matters are to be addressed, (1) the failure of Judge Capulong to decide cases within the reglementary period; and (2) the failure of Atty. Llanes to include Criminal Case No. 01-1014 in the docket inventory submitted to the Court.\n\nAs to Judge Capulong, we agree with the OCA that Judge Capulong was guilty of delay in the disposition of cases. Section 15(1), Article VIII of the Constitution is instructive. It mandates the lower courts to resolve cases within 3 months. Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct mandates judges to decide cases within the required period. Delay in the disposition of cases not only deprives litigants of their right to speedy disposition of their cases, but it also tarnishes the image of the judiciary. Failure to decide cases on time constitutes inefficiency that merits administrative sanction. [7]\n\nJudge Capulong has passed away, and even before his death, we were aware of his poor health at that time. Hence, for reason of compassion, we shall delete the imposition of the fine, and dismiss now the case against him.\n\nAs to Atty. Llanes, we again affirm the findings of OCA.\n\nIn Administrative Circular No. 10-94, dated June 29, 1994, we directed all trial courts to submit the physical inventory of their docket as required by Administrative Circular No. 1, dated January 28, 1988. Due to reports that discrepancies in the docket inventory were unavoidable and that more time to re-inventory was needed, the Court issued Administrative Circular No. 17-94 which authorized trial courts to devote one week each semester to do their audit and inventory during which period trials need not be scheduled. [8]\n\nAs a clerk of court, Atty. Llanes was specifically mandated to safeguard the integrity of the court and its proceedings, and to maintain the authenticity and correctness of court records. [9] However, Atty. Llanes failed to include Criminal Case No. 01-1014 in the July to December 2001 docket inventory. She invoked as excuses the fact that the discrepancies in the docket inventory she submitted was unintentional, and that she had a heavy case load at that time. In our view, her averments were but lame excuses that were unacceptable and did not justify her neglect of duty.\n\nSimple neglect of duty is a less grave offense penalized with suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense and dismissal for the second offense. [10]\n\nHowever, in determining the applicable penalty in this case, this Court takes into consideration the lack of bad faith and that this is the first time that this incident happened during Atty. Llanes's watch as Clerk of Court. In view of her resignation from the judiciary which makes suspension inapplicable, the proper action in her case is to impose a fine.\n\nWHEREFORE , the case against Judge Ignacio M. Capulong is hereby DISMISSED . Let the retirement benefits and other benefits of Judge Ignacio M. Capulong be released immediately, if not yet released.\n\nIn the case of Atty. Leilia R. Llanes, she is found GUILTY of simple neglect of duty, and is hereby FINED P5,000.00. Let a copy of this resolution be spread in her service record, and another copy furnished to the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, Department of Justice, where she is now employed.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, Carpio-Morales, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 3-9.\n\n[2] Id. at 56-57.\n\n[3] Id. at 247-253.\n\n[4] Id. at 254.\n\n[5] Id. at 273.\n\n[6] Id. at 279-281.\n\n[7] Report on the On-the-Spot Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Courts, Branches 45 and 53, Bacolod City , A.M.

LAWAS, CLERK III, OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENT\nD E C I S I O N\nENGRACIO M. ESCASINAS, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. GARY G. LAWAS, CLERK III, OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis treats of the letter-complaint [1] dated June 15, 2005 filed by Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff Engracio M. Escasinas, Jr. of the Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Makati City, charging Gary Lawas, Clerk III of the same office, with Frequent Unauthorized Absences and Tardiness.\n\nEscasinas reports that Lawas incurred 75 days of continuous absences without approved leave from February 18 to June 15, 2005 (except May 4 to 5, 2005), and 148 days of absences and 65 instances of tardiness in 2004. Consequently, Escasinas issued several memoranda warning Lawas that he will be sanctioned for his persistent absences and tardiness, and failure to submit his daily time record and applications for leave on time.\n\nIn his Comment [2] dated August 31, 2005, Lawas admits that he had incurred frequent unauthorized absences and had been repeatedly tardy but asks for the Court's leniency explaining that his severe rheumatic arthritis had caused his lapses. He adds that he has been able to report for work since July 4, 2005.\n\nThe Certification [3] dated August 11, 2005 issued by the Leave Division of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) shows that Lawas was tardy 65 times in 2004. That same year, he incurred a total of 146.5 absences, [4] 23 of which were unauthorized, his applications for leave for the months of June and July 2004 having been disapproved due to insufficient leave credits. He also had a total of 74 days vacation leave without pay and 31.5 days sick leave without pay.\n\nThe OCA further notes that Lawas incurred a total of 95 absences from February to June 2005, all with disapproved leave applications and therefore, unauthorized.\n\nIn its Memorandum [5] dated August 8, 2006, the OCA recommends that Lawas be suspended for a period of six (6) months without pay for Habitual Absenteeism and Tardiness.\n\nWe required the parties to manifest whether they are willing to submit the case for decision on the basis of the pleadings and records already filed with the Court. [6] Both Lawas and Escasinas expressed their willingness is contained in their Manifestations dated November 3, 2006 and October 25, 2006, respectively.\n\nWe agree with the recommendation of the OCA.\n\nSec. 23(q), Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 (Rules) provides that \"[A]n officer or employee in the civil service shall be considered habitually absent if he incurs unauthorized absences exceeding the allowable 2.5 days monthly leave credit under the Leave Law for at least three (3) months in a semester or at least three (3) consecutive months during the year.\" Paragraph (c) of the same section provides that \"[A]n employee shall be considered habitually tardy if he incurs tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes, ten times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or at two (2) consecutive months during the year.\"\n\nLawas' frequent unauthorized absences and habitual tardiness are on record and acknowledged by him. He offers the explanation that his recurrent ailment is to blame for his poor attendance but his reason does not satisfy us because it does not account for his failure to timely file his leave applications. Moreover, as correctly pointed out by the OCA, a proper sense of responsibility and courtesy should have prompted Lawas to at least notify his office on the days that he would be absent.\n\nIn not a few cases, this Court has held that habitual absenteeism and unreasonable tardiness are impermissible. The Court has emphasized the need for officials and employees of the judiciary to strictly observe official time in order to inspire public respect for the judicial system. [7]\n\nUnder the Rules, frequent unauthorized absences, loafing or frequent unauthorized absences from duty during regular office hours shall be punishable by suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and by dismissal for the second offense. On the other hand, habitual tardiness is punishable by reprimand for the first offense, suspension for one (1) day to thirty (30) days for the second offense, and dismissal for the third offense.\n\nConsidering Lawas' admission of his guilt and promise to improve his ways, we find the recommended penalty of suspension for six (6) months appropriate.\n\nWHEREFORE, Gary Lawas, Clerk III of the Office of the Clerk of Court-Regional Trial Court, Makati City, is found GUILTY of Frequent Unauthorized Absences and Habitual Tardiness and is hereby SUSPENDED for a period of Six (6) Months Without Pay, with WARNING that subsequent like infractions shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio-Morales, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 1-44, with annexes.\n\n[2] Id. at 46-53.\n\n[3] Id. at 88-89.\n\n[4] The Memorandum dated August 8, 2006 of the OCA states that the Lawas incurred 148 absences in 2004 based on the Certification of the OCA, Leave Division.\n\n[5] Rollo , pp. 96-100.\n\n[6] Resolution dated September 18, 2006.\n\n[7] Pagulayan-Torres v.

BONIFACIO, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 159, MS. ROSALIE G. SAN JUAN, CLERK IV AND MR. ARNEL D. LEYNES, CLERK III, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT-OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT, PASIG CITY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO MORALES, J.:\n\nThis administrative case against respondents stemmed from the Letter-Report [1] dated August 2, 2004 of Atty. Grace S. Belvis (Atty. Belvis), Clerk of Court of the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, to the Executive Judge, Edwin A. Villasor, who in turn submitted a Report [2] dated August 18, 2004 to this Court.\n\nFrom the records of this case, the following facts are culled:\n\nOn July 22, 2004, at about 4:25 in the afternoon, Atty. Belvis was approached by City Prosecutor Dennis Pastrana regarding the posting of a cash bond by a certain Rodolfo \"Rudy\" Lantano. No Information having been filed against Lantano, Atty. Belvis gave the prosecution time to file it. She waited until 4:40 p.m. of that day but as no information was filed, she instructed Cash Clerk III Edna Samar (Edna) to close the Cashier's Office and left.\n\nThe next day, July 23, 2004, before 8:00 a.m., she was informed by Administrative Officer II Teresita Wanason (Teresita) and Edna that 3 sets of official receipts corresponding to Fiduciary, Judiciary Development Fund, and SAJJ-Court were missing. After a fruitless search in the Cashier's Office, a call was made to respondent Clerk IV Rosalie San Juan (Rosalie) to ask her if somebody had posted a cash bond the day before. Rosalie answered in the affirmative. At around 8:25 a.m. of the same day Rosalie brought to the cashier 3 sets of receipts and the P81,200 bond she had received.\n\nIn her undated letter to Atty. Belvis, respondent Rosalie gave an account of the circumstances behind her receipt of the cash bond:\nOn or about 6:00 p.m., Thursday, July 22, 2004, while I was resting in Branch 68 after playing badminton, Mr. Arnel Leynes, Clerk III , office of the Clerk of Court together with a certain Atty. Art Naciongaling, lawyer of the detained accused Mr. Rodolfo Lantano approached me to issue a receipt on a cash bond for the release of the abovementioned accused but I refused to do so since it was past working hours . After about 30 minutes, the daughter of the accused came and pleaded that her father is very old and very sick and needs to be brought to the hospital as soon as possible. I was so touched and with compassion I reluctantly made a receipt on the cash bond .\n\nI admit that we (with the help of my friends) entered the Cashier's Office to be able to get the [o]fficial receipts and issue the corresponding receipt but not after Mr. Arnel Leynes gave me the corresponding criminal case number since I could not issue a receipt without the said docket number.\n\nI also admit that we went to the Prosecutor's Office where I received the payment personally from the daughter of the accused, who could not come to the RTC Office because she fell from the stairs of the Office of the Prosecutor and she sprained her right leg.\n\nAs a sign of good faith, I brought the payment and receipts to the Cashier's Office early in the morning the following day, Friday, July 23, 2004.\n\nx x x x [3] (Underscoring supplied) For his part, respondent Clerk III Arnel Leynes (Leynes) submitted his Incident Report dated July 23, 2004 to Atty. Belvis.\n. . . Habang ako ay naglalaro ng badminton . . .sa quadrangle ng RTC, Pasig City ay may lumapit sa akin na isang taong nagpakilalang Atty. Art. Humihingi siya ng tulong sa akin para sa kaso ng kliyente nyang si RODOLFO \"Rudy\" LANTANO na mag-ca-cash bond daw. Ang sagot ko po sa kanya ay wala ng magreresibo at wala ng pipirma ng release order kaya sabi niya ay may kakausapin daw silang judge . Kaya ang sabi ko sige po kausapin na muna ninyo yung sinasabi nyong judge . After 30 minutes bumalik si Atty. Art kasama yung anak ng akusado sinasabing meron daw taga Cashier's Office. Pero ang sabi ko ang alam ko ay naka lock na ang Cashier's office. Tapos pinakilala ko sila kay Rosalie San Juan. Tapos iniwan ko na sila sa kanilang pag-uusap. Pagkatapos mayamaya ay nakita kong umalis na si Atty. Art. Makalipas ang ilang minuto ay umalis din si Rosalie. After 30 minutes, bumalik si Rosalie at tinawag ako at nagpasama sa Rizal Prosecutor's Office. P agdating naming doon nakita ko si Judge Bonifacio at Fiscal Yson na magkausap kasama ang ibang staff ng piskalya. Tapos isang staff ang lumapit sa akin at iniabot ang information ng kaso. Tapos sinabi ko kay Judge Bonifacio na wala pa sa jurisdiction po natin ang kasong iyan. Ang sagot nya kaya nga iyan inabot na sa iyo ang information bukas na lang papapirmahan sa logbook kase wala na daw yung in-charge kaya gawin mo na kung ano ang trabaho mo. Kaya bumalik po ako sa RTC-Office at tiningnan ko sa docket book kung ano ang ilalagay kong case number. Tapos bumalik po ako sa prosecutor's office para sabihin kung anong case number ang ilalagay at pagkatapos ay gumawa na nang resibo si Rosalie. Pagkagawa ng resibo pinirmahan na ni Judge Bonifacio yung release order at naghiwahiwalay na kami .\n\nKinabukasan ng July 23, 2004 pumunta sa Criminal Docket ang isa sa staff ng piskalya dala ang logbook at ibang attachments para sa kaso ni Rodolfo \"Rudy\" Lantano para papirmahan sa akin ung na-receive kong kopya ng information nung July 22, 2004. [4] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) By Agenda Report [5] dated January 17, 2005, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) made the following Evaluation of and Recommendations on the case as follows:\nEVALUATION: This Office finds as patently highly irregular and anomalous the processing of the application for bail \u2013 the receipt of the cash bond and the issuance of the release order \u2013 on 22 July 2004 at the Pasig City RTC. Applying for bail requires compliance with a procedure intended to prevent abuses or irregularities from being committed. A case must be duly filed before the court, properly docketed thereat and the legal fees paid. If the bail is granted, certain documents and other attachments need to be appended to the records of the case before an accused may be released from custody.\n\nAfter a careful study of the reports submitted by the personnel of the Pasig City RTC-OCC involved in the incident, we deem Ms Rosalie G. San Juan and Mr. Arnel D. Leynes, in view of their admissions, liable for violation of procedural rules as well as office rules and regulations relating to the acceptance of a cash bond and the issuance of official receipts therefor.\n\nMs. San Juan contends that she acted in good faith and in the honest belief that she was merely doing her job as a public servant. We believe that in the instant case, however, she has outdone herself by going beyond the scope of her duties and responsibilities. The fact that she had to climb over the room divider separating the cash section from the other sections of the OCC, and not enter[ed] the said premises through its locked door, shows that she had no business being within the confines of the cash section. She was not the person assigned by the office to issue the official receipts for legal fees or any kind of payment. Since she was not the designated personnel with authority to receive payment, she was not a bonded official. She should answer for the improper and irregular acceptance of a cash bond and the issuance of the official receipts therefor. Her desire to help the accused does not justify non-compliance with legal procedures.\n\nMr. Leynes should be held liable for giving the case number for an information yet to be filed and docketed in order to facilitate and render regular the issuance of the official receipts by Ms. San Juan. In the matter at hand, the release of accused Rodolfo Lantano was effected without the proper filing of the information and other documentary attachments required in posting bail under the Rules of Court. The submission of the requirements the following day did not remedy the flaw in the processing of the bail application owing to Mr. Leynes' non-compliance with procedural rules.\n\nThe participation of Judge Rodolfo R. Bonifacio, presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 159) at Pasig City, in the episode involved as alleged by Mr. Leynes in his Incident Report dated 23 July 2004 should also be looked into. Judge Bonifacio, as an officer of the court, had moral ascendancy over Mr. Leynes and Ms. San Juan and his presence and utterances had greatly influenced their actuations .\n\nx x x x\n\nRECOMMENDATION[S]: The foregoing considered, we respectfully submit the following recommendations for the consideration of the Honorable Court:\nThat the Report dated 18 August 2004 of Executive Judge Edwin A. Villasor of the Regional Trial Court at Pasig City regarding the [i]ncident at the Pasig City RTC-OCC on 22 July 2004 be REDOCKETED as a regular administrative matter;\n\nThat Ms. ROSALIE G. SAN JUAN and Mr. ARNEL D. LEYNES, Clerk IV and Clerk III, respectively, at the Pasig City RTC-OCC be found liable for IMPROPER CONDUCT for acting beyond the scope of their judicial duties and responsibilities and circumventing provisions of the Rules of Court on Bail;\n\nThat Ms. San Juan and Mr. Leynes each be FINED the amount of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos and be STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely;\n\nThat Judge Rodolfo R. Bonifacio , Presiding Judge of Pasig City RTC (Branch 159) be required to show-cause why no administrative disciplinary action should be taken against him for his participation in the incident at the Pasig City RTC-OCC on 22 July 2004; and\n\nThat Atty. Grace S. Belvis, Clerk of Court of the Pasig City RTC-OCC be ADVISED to conduct closer supervision over the personnel of the Office of the Clerk of Court and to be more vigilant in the keeping of official papers, including blank and used official receipts. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Acting on the Recommendations of the OCA, this Court, by Resolution of February 14, 2005, [6] directed, among other things, respondent Judge Rodolfo R. Bonifacio to show cause why no administrative disciplinary action should be taken against him.\n\nBy Compliance [7] received on September 12, 2005, respondent Judge Bonifacio gave his side of the case.\n\nOn the Recommendation of the OCA in its December 12, 2005 Report, [8] this Court, by Resolution dated February 8, 2006, [9] dismissed the case against respondent Judge Bonifacio but warned him \"to be more careful in his actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.\"\n\nRespondents (Rosalie) and Leynes who were, by Resolution dated February 14, 2005, required to manifest within 20 days from notice whether they are willing to submit the case for resolution on the basis of the pleadings/records, failed to respond to the Resolution.\n\nThe OCA thus reiterated its recommendations numbers 2, 3 and 5 [10] in its January 17, 2005 Report by Memorandum dated July 27, 2006. [11]\n\nNo doubt, respondents Rosalie and Leynes are liable for simple misconduct. Misconduct has been defined as an unacceptable behavior that transgresses the established rules of conduct for public officers. [12]\n\nThe established norm of conduct for court employees has always been to maintain a hands-off attitude where unofficial and/or irregular dealings with party-litigants are concerned. Such an attitude is indispensable for two reasons: (1) to maintain the integrity of the courts, and (2) to free the court personnel from suspicion of any misconduct. [13] For the conduct of each employee of a court of justice must, at all times, not only be characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all, beyond suspicion. [14]\n\nIn one case where a utility worker, without authority of the trial court or branch clerk of court, and in his belief that he was doing public service, detached the bailbond and the accompanying documents from the record of the case and gave them to the representative of the therein accused, this Court found him guilty of simple misconduct. [15]\n\nAccommodating a person at the expense of the legal processes tends to frustrate and betray the public trust in the judicial system.\n\nUnder the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service , [16] simple misconduct is a less grave offense penalized with suspension from One (1) Month and One (1) Day to Six (6) Months for the first offense [17] and dismissal for the second offense. [18] While in some cases of misconduct, this Court imposed a fine in lieu of suspension, it did so upon a showing that public service would be adversely be affected if suspension is effected or that its imposition had been rendered inappropriate. [19] No such or analogous circumstance is present in this case. The penalty recommended by the OCA does not thus sit well with this Court.\n\nOne word on the Clerk of Court. This Court takes the opportunity to remind Atty. Belvis to take a closer, sustained supervision of her staff in the Office of the Clerk of Court to avoid the occurrence of similar incidents.\n\nWHEREFORE, this Court finds respondent Rosalie G. San Juan and Mr. Arnel D. Leynes, Clerk IV and Clerk III, respectively, at the Pasig City Regional Trial Court-Office of the Clerk of Court, guilty of SIMPLE MISCONDUCT for which they are SUSPENDED from office for One (1) Month and One (1) Day without pay, effective upon receipt of this Decision, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\n\n* Entitled \"Report of Executive Judge Edwin A.

COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND PAMARAN T. MATURAN, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nThis resolves the petition for certiorari seeking to set aside the Resolution [1] of the First Division of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC 1 st Division) dated October 21, 2005 granting private respondent's petition for certiorari and prohibition, and the Resolution [2] of the Commission on Elections En Banc (COMELEC En Banc ) dated December 12, 2005 affirming the aforementioned Resolution of the COMELEC 1 st Division.\n\nA thorough scrutiny of the records reveals that the narration of the antecedent facts set forth in the COMELEC 1 st Division Resolution dated October 21, 2005 is undisputed; hence, the pertinent portions thereof are reproduced hereunder: During the 2004 elections, Maturan [herein private respondent], Istarul [herein petitioner] as well Munap H. Pacio and Ahmad Atahal ran for the position of mayor of the municipality of Tipo-Tipo, Basilan.\n\nMaturan was eventually proclaimed by the Municipal Board of Canvassers as the duly elected mayor of Tipo-Tipo.\u00a0 Thereafter, private respondent Istarul filed an election protest [3] case docketed Election Case No. 01-04.\u00a0 Pacio, another losing candidate, also filed his protest case docketed as Election Case No. 26-04.\u00a0 Both cases were assigned to the public respondent [4] who, for reason of consistency, decided them jointly.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the joint decision dated August 10, 2005 is quoted as follows: \"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the court hereby ANNULS the proclamation of protestee dated May 15, 2004, and DECLARES protestant Ingatun G. Istarul as the duly elected Mayor of the Municipality of Tipo-Tipo, Basilan, having obtained the highest number of votes for the said office in the election held on May 10, 2004.\" On the same date, August 10, 2005, petitioner filed his Notice of Appeal.\u00a0 The following day, August 11, 2004, private respondent filed his Motion for Execution Pending Appeal.\u00a0 On August 17, 2005, petitioner filed his Opposition thereto.\u00a0 After the hearing, specifically on August 22, 2005, public respondent issued its Special Order granting private respondent's Motion.\u00a0 He also issued a Writ of Execution on the same day.\n\nOn August 23, 2005, the instant petition was filed.\u00a0 On the same day, this Commission (First Division) issued a Temporary Restraining/Status Quo Ante Order.\n\nAfter the hearing, both parties filed their respective memoranda.\u00a0 Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for resolution. [5] On October 21, 2005, the COMELEC 1 st Division issued a Resolution holding that there are no good reasons to justify the issuance of the Special Order granting execution pending appeal.\u00a0 The COMELEC 1 st Division ruled that Judge Danilo Bucoy's failure to establish that public interest would be served; and that a mere statement about the length of time that the case had been pending in the trial court do not support the issuance of said Order.\n\nThe COMELEC 1 st Division further noted in its Resolution that Judge Bucoy failed to state in the Joint Decision dated August 10, 2005 his explanation for crediting certain ballots in favor of either of the parties, thus, violating the principle that a decision should clearly show the basis for the judge's rulings.\u00a0 It then concluded that the decision is seriously impaired and cannot be the source of a valid execution pending appeal.\n\nThe dispositive portion of the Resolution of the COMELEC 1 st Division dated October 21, 2005 reads as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Special Order and the Writ of Execution issued by the public respondent, the Honorable Danilo Bucoy, dated August 22, 2005 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.\u00a0 Private Respondent INGATARUN G. ISTARUL is directed to immediately cease and desist from performing his functions as mayor of the municipality of Tipo-Tipo, Basilan.\u00a0 Petitioner PAMARAN MATURAN is restored to his position as Mayor of the same municipality and instructed to perform his functions as such until the final determination of the appeal case he filed.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6] Petitioner then filed a motion for reconsideration which was referred to the COMELEC En Banc .\u00a0 On December 12, 2005, it issued a Resolution affirming the Resolution of the COMELEC 1 st Division.\u00a0 The COMELEC En Banc reiterated that there were no good reasons for the issuance of execution pending appeal because a final determination of the true will of the people would be had only after the resolution of the appeal pending with the COMELEC 1 st Division.\n\nAggrieved by the actions of the COMELEC 1 st Division and the En Banc , petitioner then filed the present petition for certiorari assailing said Tribunal's Resolutions.\n\nPetitioner prayed for the issuance of a temporary restraining order which this Court granted in its Resolution dated January 17, 2006.\u00a0 Thereafter, private respondent filed a motion to lift the temporary restraining order.\u00a0 On February 28, 2006, the Court issued a Resolution dissolving the temporary restraining order because private respondent was able to prove that, at the time of the filing of the petition, he was the one acting as Mayor of Tipo-Tipo, Basilan.\n\nAs grounds for allowance of the petition, it is alleged that: 5.1.1.\u00a0 The Comelec seriously erred in wantonly disregarding the jurisprudential rule on execution pending appeal.\n5.1.2. The Comelec seriously erred in ignoring that rule that, as between two presumptive winners, the proclamation made by the court prevails over that of the board of canvassers.\n5.1.3.\u00a0 The Comelec seriously erred in not considering the fact that petitioner never filed a motion for reconsideration with the trial court.\n5.1.4.\u00a0 The assailed Resolution violated the right of the petitioner to procedural due process and the equal protection clause since it never considered the basic issues raised by petitioner in his pleadings. [7] Private respondent, on the other hand, counters that the Joint Decision of Judge Bucoy dated August 10, 2005 is null and void for failure of the trial court to state particular reasons for rejecting certain ballots and, as such, it should not be executed pending appeal.\u00a0 He further argues that in this case, the filing of a motion for reconsideration with the trial court before filing his petition for certiorari with the COMELEC could be dispensed with considering that the need for relief is extremely urgent.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that \"unless the COMELEC is shown to have committed grave abuse of discretion, its decision will not be interfered with by this Court.\" [8] In this case, petitioner fails to convince the Court that the COMELEC 1 st Division and En Banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIt is clear from the discussion in the petition that what are assigned as errors of the COMELEC 1 st Division and En Banc - i.e., that the COMELEC erred in wantonly disregarding the jurisprudential rule on execution pending appeal; in ignoring that rule that, as between two presumptive winners, the proclamation made by the court prevails over that of the board of canvassers; in not considering the fact that private respondent did not file a motion for reconsideration before the trial court; and in not considering the issues raised by petitioner in his pleadings - are merely alleged errors of judgment as they question the wisdom and legal soundness of the COMELEC's resolutions and not the jurisdiction of said body.\u00a0 In People v. Court of Appeals , [9] the Court expounded on the function of the remedy of certiorari as follows: As observed in Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, et al. \"the special civil action for certiorari is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment.\u00a0 The raison d'etre for the rule is when a court exercises its jurisdiction, an error committed while so engaged does not deprive it of the jurisdiction being exercised when the error is committed .\u00a0 If it did, every error committed by a court would deprive it of its jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment would be a void judgment.\u00a0 In such a scenario, the administration of justice would not survive. Hence, where the issue or question involved affects the wisdom or legal soundness of the decision - not the jurisdiction of the court to render said decision - the same is beyond the province of a special civil action for certiorari. x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x [10] (Emphasis supplied) Evidently, since the issues raised in this petition merely question the correctness of the COMELEC's rulings, petitioner cannot avail of the writ of certiorari .\n\nNevertheless, a close examination of the records reveals that petitioner's allegations are baseless.\n\nThere is no showing whatsoever that the COMELEC disregarded the jurisprudential rule on execution pending appeal.\u00a0 On the contrary, the COMELEC 1 st Division and the COMELEC En Banc proceeded on the premise that, indeed, execution pending appeal may be granted in election cases provided there are good reasons therefore as held in a long line of cases. [11] Unfortunately, in this case, the COMELEC 1 st Division and COMELEC En Banc found the \"good reasons\" alleged by petitioner and relied on by the trial court to be insufficient to justify the issuance of the special order granting execution pending appeal.\n\nPetitioner cites as one of the \"good reasons\" for execution pending appeal, the will of the electorate, based on the finding of the trial court that he garnered the highest number of votes for the position of mayor of Tipo-Tipo, Basilan during the May 2004 elections.\u00a0 However, the COMELEC 1st Division, in its Resolution dated October 21, 2005, found the trial court's Joint Decision to be \"seriously impaired\" for its (trial court's) failure to state any explanation as to its rulings regarding the crediting of votes in favor of the candidates and the COMELEC concluded that \"a decision suffering from grave infirmities cannot be a source of a valid execution.\" [12]\n\nA perusal of the Joint Decision of the trial court, on its face, shows that the COMELEC's observation that there was a total lack of explanation for the trial court's rulings for crediting ballots or votes in favor of the candidates, is correct. Apparently, the supposed victory of petitioner has not been clearly established. Hence, the COMELEC has a valid basis for not considering the supposed will of the electorate as a \"good reason\" to allow execution pending appeal.\u00a0 Having such a basis for its ruling, the COMELEC cannot be deemed to have gravely abused its discretion.\n\nVerily, there is, as yet, no strong evidence that it is, indeed, the will of the electorate for herein petitioner to occupy the position of mayor of Tipo-Tipo, Basilan, as said issue is still pending resolution in the appeal filed by private respondent before the COMELEC.\n\nMoreover, the length of time that the election protest has been pending, thus, leaving petitioner only 21 months as the remaining portion of the term to serve as mayor, does not constitute \"good reason\" to justify execution pending appeal.\u00a0 The case of Fermo v. Comelec , [13] which is closely analogous to the present case, is instructive.\u00a0 Therein, the Court stated thus: \"Shortness of term,\" alone and by itself cannot justify premature execution. It must be manifest in the decision sought to be executed that the defeat of the protestee and the victory of the protestant has been clearly established. [14] (Emphasis supplied) The COMELEC also did not ignore the rule that, as between two presumptive winners, the proclamation made by the trial court prevails over that of the board of canvassers.\u00a0 However, after finding that the trial court's ruling regarding which candidate garnered the highest number of votes is unreliable, the COMELEC applied the ruling in Camlian v. Comelec , [15] where the Court agreed with the COMELEC that: x\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0 while it is true that when an election protest is filed the protestee is only considered a presumptive winner until the protest is resolved, in the same way, when a protestant is adjudged the winner by a court of law but the case is on appeal with the Commission, such appeal likewise makes the protestant a presumptive winner and, unless meritorious grounds exist to execute judgment pending appeal, it is illogical to replace a presumptive winner proclaimed by a board of canvassers, by another presumptive winner so declared by a court.\u00a0 It needs no explanation that when a protestant is installed as a winner pending appeal, that in itself is already disruptive of the government service.\u00a0 How much more if the protestee wins the\u00a0 appeal in which case he will have to be reinstalled again to the office which he was forced to vacate? [16] (Emphasis supplied) With regard to petitioner's asseveration that the COMELEC did not consider the circumstance that private respondent did not file a motion for reconsideration of the Special Order before filing the petition for certiorari , the Court finds the same unmeritorious.\u00a0 Note that the COMELEC 1 st Division pointed out that \"a decision suffering from grave infirmities cannot be a source of a valid execution.\" [17] Evidently, the COMELEC found the case to be one of those falling within the exceptions to the general rule that the filing of which is an indispensable condition to the filing of a special civil action for certiorari .\u00a0 Some of the exceptions to this general rule are: (1) when public interest is involved, (2) the matter is one of urgency, and (3) the order is a patent nullity. [18] Since the COMELEC found the Joint Decision of the trial court to be seriously impaired, it then concluded that the Special Order granting execution pending appeal is invalid or a patent nullity; and that the trial court was then acting with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it issued said Special Order.\u00a0 Again, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion committed by the COMELEC in ruling so.\n\nPetitioner tries to impress upon the Court that the COMELEC acted with bias.\u00a0 He cites the speed with which the COMELEC 1 st Division issued and served the Temporary Restraining Order on the trial court in Basilan.\u00a0 However, petitioner failed to submit any proof of the alleged irregularity that the bailiff of the COMELEC was already in Basilan in the morning of August 24, 2005 to serve the TRO, while the order for him to proceed to Basilan was released only at noon of August 24, 2005.\n\nPetitioner also questions the fact that the Resolution of the COMELEC 1 st Division dated October 21, 2005 was promulgated merely four days after the submission of the parties' memoranda.\u00a0\u00a0 This circumstance does not at all show bias or grave abuse of discretion.\u00a0 Rather, it shows that the COMELEC is upholding its mandate to resolve issues before it with dispatch.\n\nLastly, petitioner questions why the COMELEC did not dismiss the petition filed by private respondent despite the fact that private respondent had allegedly been convicted of nepotism and violation of Section 4 (c ) of Republic Act No. 6713, otherwise known as the \"Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.\" Thus, argues petitioner, private respondent had lost the legal personality to pursue the case against petitioner.\u00a0 Private respondent was, however, able to present a Joint Order [19] of the Office of the Ombudsman dated January 11, 2006 stating that herein private respondent's motion for reconsideration is submitted for resolution.\u00a0 This proves that the judgment of the Ombudsman has not yet become final and executory as private respondent's motion for reconsideration of the resolution of the Ombudsman is still pending.\u00a0 Furthermore, this issue is better addressed in the appeal before the COMELEC, as the only issue in this petition for certiorari is whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion by setting aside the trial court's Special Order allowing execution pending appeal.\n\nIn sum, petitioner has not sufficiently proven that the COMELEC acted with bias or capricious and whimsical arbitrariness to warrant the issuance of the writ of certiorari .\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.\u00a0 Costs against petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., Puno, Quisumbing, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Corona, Carpio Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Garcia, and Velasco, Jr., JJ., concur.\nYnares-Santiago, J., on leave.\n\n[1] Per Curiam\n\n[2] Per Curiam\n\n[3] With the Regional Trial Court, Branch 2, Isabela City, Basilan.\n\n[4] Judge Danilo Bucoy.\n\n[5] Rollo , pp. 55-56.\n\n[6] Rollo , pp. 60-61.\n\n[7] Rollo , p. 11.\n\n[8] Sarangani v.

      "title": "Records show that the act complained of was discovered in 1992. The complaint was filed with the Office of the Ombudsman on April 5, 1995,[17] or within three (3) years from the time of discovery. Thus, the filing of the complaint was well within the prescriptive period of 15 years.On the issue of whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that no probable cause exists against respondents, it must be stressed that the Ombudsman is empowered to determine whether there exists reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and, thereafter, to file the corresponding information with the appropriate courts.[18] Settled is the rule that the Supreme Court will not ordinarily interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers without good and compelling reasons to indicate otherwise.[19] Said exercise of powers is based upon his constitutional mandate[20] and the courts will not interfere in its exercise. The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman, but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, innumerable petitions seeking dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Ombudsman will grievously hamper the functions of the office and the courts, in much the same way that courts will be swamped if they had to review the exercise of discretion on the part of public prosecutors each time they decided to file an information or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.[21] While there are certain instances when this Court may intervene in the prosecution of cases, such as, (1) when necessary to afford adequate protection to the constitutional rights of the accused; (2) when necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions; (3) when there is a prejudicial question which is sub-judice; (4) when the acts of the officer are without or in excess of authority; (5) where the prosecution is under an invalid law, ordinance or regulation; (6) when double jeopardy is clearly apparent; (7) where the court has no jurisdiction over the offense; (8) where it is a case of persecution rather than prosecution; (9) where the charges are manifestly false and motivated by the lust for vengeance; and (10) when there is clearly no prima facie case against the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has been denied, [22] none apply here.After examination of the records and the evidence presented by petitioner, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the Ombudsman.No grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the Ombudsman. Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.[23] The exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility. It must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.[24]The disquisition of GIO Diaz-Salcedo, in dismissing the criminal complaint, as approved by Ombudsman Desierto, is worth-quoting, thus: Taking into consideration the provisions of Administrative Order No. 13 and Memorandum Order No. 61, the subject transactions can not be classified as behest.Evaluation of the records of this case reveals that the loans acquired by NOCOSII are actually foreign loans from Midland Bank Ltd. of London. There were no direct loans released by PNB but merely credit accommodations to guaranty the loans from Midland Bank.Anent complainant's claim that the collaterals offered by NOCOSII are insufficient, it should be noted that under PNB Board Resolution No. 689 dated July 30, 1975, one of the conditions imposed to NOCOSII was the execution of contract assigning all NOCOSII's share of sugar and molasses to PNB. NOCOSII was also required to increase its paid up capital at P5,000,000.00 a year starting April 30, 1976 up to April 30, 1980 or a total of P25,000,000.00. In addition thereto, the stockholders of NOCOSII were required to pledge or assign all their present and future shares to PNB while the accommodation remains standing. The proposed plant site which was offered as collateral was estimated to cost P307,903,000.00. The foregoing collaterals offered by NOCOSII are more than sufficient to cover the loans of P333,465,260.00.Furthermore, since the loan was approved by PNB, it presupposes that all the required clearances were submitted by NOCOSII including the clearance from the Office of the President; and having complied with all the documentary requirements, NOCOSII became entitled to the release of the loan.Complainant further alleged that NOCOSII was undercapitalized because its paid up capital was only P50,000,000.00. Complainant, however, failed to consider the other assets of NOCOSII which also form part of its capital. x x x [25]The finding of insufficiency of evidence or lack of probable cause by the Ombudsman is borne out by the evidence presented by petitioner: firstly, there were no direct loans released by PNB but merely credit accommodations to guaranty NOCOSII's foreign loans from Midland Bank Ltd. of London; secondly, NOCOSII effectively came under government control since 1975 when PNB acquired a majority of the voting rights in NOCOSII and was given the power to appoint a comptroller therein; thirdly, PNB's credit accommodations to NOCOSII between 1975 and 1981 in the aggregate sum of P333,465,260.00 were sufficiently secured by: (1) the Assignment of Subscription Rights and/or Pledge of Shares dated September 5, 1975 whereby NOCOSII officers pledged their shares of stock, representing 90% of NOCOSII's subscribed capital stock, and assigned their subscription rights to future stocks in favor of PNB;[26] (2) the Deed of Assignment dated September 5, 1975 whereby NOCOSII assigned its share of sugar and molasses from the operation of its sugar central located at Barrio Mateo, Matalam, North Cotabato in favor of PNB;[27] (3) the Joint and Solidary Agreement dated September 5, 1975 whereby the NOCOSII officers bound themselves jointly and severally liable with the corporation for the payment of NOCOSII's obligations to PNB;[28] (4) the Real Estate Mortgage dated October 2, 1981 whereby NOCOSII mortgaged various buildings, machineries and equipments, otherwise known as the NOCOSII Sugar Mill Plant, with an estimated value of P307,593,000.00 in favor of PNB;[29] and (5) the Chattel Mortgage with Power of Attorney dated October 2, 1981 whereby NOCOSII mortgaged various transportation, agricultural and heavy equipment in favor of the PNB;[30] fourthly, PNB imposed other conditions, such as, (1) the submission by NOCOSII of the Central Bank's approval of its foreign loans; (2) the submission by NOCOSII of the required clearances from the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and/or Presidential Committee on Sugar Industry (PHILSUGIN); (3) submission by NOCOSII of its milling contracts covering a total area of not less than 14,000 hectares; (4) submission by NOCOSII of the government permit that the planters can cultivate the required hectarage; (5) further increase in NOCOSII's total paid-in capital to P25,000,000.00 at P5,000,000.00 a year starting April 30, 1976 up to April 30, 1980; (6) deposit in NOCOSII's account with the PNB of all cash proceeds of NOCOSII's foreign loans the disposition of which shall be subject to the bank's control; and, (7) designation by the PNB of its own representatives in NOCOSII's Board of Directors and its own comptroller who shall have the authority to control all disbursements and receipts of funds of NOCOSII.",

DESIERTO, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN-MANILA, CONCERNED MEMBERS OF THE PNB BOARD OF DIRECTORS, REYNALDO TUASON, CARLOS CAJELO, JOSE BARQUILLO, JR., LORETO SOLSONA, PRIMICIAS BANAGA, JOHN DOES, AND NORTHERN COTABATO SUGAR INDUSTRIES, INC. (NOCOSII), RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nThe Presidential Commission on Good Government [1] (petitioner) filed the herein Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolution [2] dated May 21, 1999 of Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto in OMB No. 0-95-0890 which dismissed petitioner's criminal complaint for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019 [3] against concerned members of Philippine National Bank (PNB) Board of Directors and Northern Cotabato Sugar Industries, Inc. (NOCOSII) officers, namely: Reynaldo Tuason, Carlos Cajelo, Jose Barquillo, Jr., Loreto Solsona, Primicias Banaga and John Does (respondents); and the Order [4] dated July 23, 1999 which denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe facts:\n\nOn October 8, 1992, then President Fidel V. Ramos issued Administrative Order No. 13 creating the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans (Committee) which was tasked to inventory all behest loans, determine the parties involved and recommend whatever appropriate actions to be pursued thereby.\n\nOn November 9, 1992, President Ramos issued Memorandum Order No. 61 expanding the functions of the Committee to include the inventory and review of all non-performing loans, whether behest or non-behest.\n\nThe Memorandum set the following criteria to show the earmarks of a \"behest loan,\" to wit: \"a) it is undercollaterized; b) the borrower corporation is undercapitalized; c) a direct or indirect endorsement by high government officials like presence of marginal notes; d) the stockholders, officers or agents of the borrower corporation are identified as cronies; e) a deviation of use of loan proceeds from the purpose intended; f) the use of corporate layering; g) the non-feasibility of the project for which financing is being sought; and, h) the extraordinary speed in which the loan release was made.\"\n\nAmong the accounts referred to the Committee's Technical Working Group (TWG) were the loan transactions between NOCOSII and PNB.\n\nAfter it had examined and studied all the documents relative to the said loan transactions, the Committee classified the loans obtained by NOCOSII from PNB as behest because of NOCOSII's insufficient capital and inadequate collaterals. Specifically, the Committee's investigation revealed that in 1975, NOCOSII obtained loans by way of Stand-By Letters of Credit from the PNB; that NOCOSII was able to get 155% loan value from the offered collateral or an excess of 85% from the required percentage limit; that the plant site offered as one of the collaterals was a public land contrary to the General Banking Act; that by virtue of the marginal note of then President Marcos in the letter of Cajelo, NOCOSII was allowed to use the public land as plant site and to dispense with the mortgage requirement of PNB; that NOCOSII's paid-up capital at the time of the approval of the guaranty was only P2,500,000.00 or only about 6% of its obligation.\n\nBased on the Sworn Statement of PCGG consultant Orlando Salvador, petitioner filed with the Office of the Ombudsman the criminal complaint against respondents. Petitioner alleges that respondents violated the following provisions of Section 3 (e) and (g) of R.A. No. 3019:\nSec. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. \u2014 In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:\n\nx x x e. Causing undue injury to any party, including the Government or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.\n\nx x x\ng. Entering, on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same, whether or not the public officer profited or will profit thereby. The respondents failed to submit any responsive pleading before the the Ombudsman, prompting Graft Investigator Officer (GIO) I Melinda S. Diaz-Salcedo to resolve the case based on the available evidence.\n\nIn a Resolution dated January 12, 1998 in OMB-0-95-0890, GIO Diaz-Salcedo recommended the dismissal of the case on the ground of insufficiency of evidence or lack of probable cause against the respondents and for prescription of the offense. Ombudsman Desierto approved the recommendation on May 21, 1999. [5]\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration [6] but it was denied by GIO Diaz-Salcedo in the Order dated July 9, 1999, which was approved by Ombudsman Desierto on July 23, 1999. [7]\n\nForthwith, petitioner elevated the case to this Court and in support of its petition alleges that:\nA)The Respondent Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion or acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in dismissing the complaint filed by the Petitioner on the ground of Prescription considering that:\nTHE RIGHT OF THE STATE TO RECOVER BEHEST LOANS AS ILL-GOTTEN WEALTH IS IMPRESCRIPTIBLE UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 15, OF THE 1987 CONSTITUTION;\n\nPRESCRIPTION DOES NOT RUN IN FAVOR OF A TRUSTEE TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE BENEFICIARY;\n\nTHE OFFENSES CHARGED ARE IN THE NATURE OF CONTINUING CRIMES AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO SUFFER INJURY ON EACH DAY OF DEFAULT IN PAYMENT. HENCE, PRESCRIPTION DOES NOT APPLY;\n\nPRESCRIPTION AS A MATTER OF DEFENSE MUST BE PLEADED, OTHERWISE, IT IS DEEMED WAIVED;\n\nPRESCRIPTION HAS NOT BEEN INVOKED IN THIS CASE. SINCE IT MAY BE WAIVED OR MAY NOT BE SET IN DEFENSE, THE OMBUDSMAN CANNOT MOTU PROPRIO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON GROUND OF PRESCRIPTION;\n\nARTICLE 91 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE WHICH ADOPTS THE \"DISCOVERY RULE\" SHALL APPLY IN THIS CASE;\n\nTHE LOAN CONTRACT AS OTHER LOAN TRANSACTIONS IN THE NATURE OF BEHEST LOANS ARE KEPT SECRET. [8]\nB) The respondent Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion or acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in not finding that a probable cause exists for violation by the private respondents of section 3 (e) and (g) of RA 3019 despite the presence of clear, overwhelming and unrebutted evidence. [9] In its Comment, the Ombudsman, without delving on the issue of prescription, in view of Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto (1999), [10] contends that its finding of insufficiency of evidence or lack of probable cause against respondents deserves great weight and respect, and must be accorded full weight and credit.\n\nNo comment was filed by the rest of the respondents.\n\nThe issue before the Court is whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling that: (a) the offense leveled against respondents has prescribed; and (b) no probable cause exists against respondents.\n\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\n\nRespondent Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the subject complaint on the ground of prescription.\n\nRespondents members of the PNB Board of Directors and Officers of NOCOSII are charged with violation of R.A. No. 3019, a special law. Amending said law, Section 4, Batas Pambansa Blg. 195, [11] increased the prescriptive period from ten to fifteen years.\n\nThe applicable law in the computation of the prescriptive period is Section 2 of Act No. 3326, [12] as amended, which provides:\nSec. 2. Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same not be known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its investigation and punishment.\n\nThe prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted against the guilty person, and shall begin to run again if the proceedings are dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy.\nThe issue of prescription has long been laid to rest in the aforementioned Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto, [13] where the Court held:\nx x x it was well-nigh impossible for the State, the aggrieved party, to have known the violations of R.A. No. 3019 at the time the questioned transactions were made because, as alleged, the public officials concerned connived or conspired with the \"beneficiaries of the loans.\" Thus, we agree with the COMMITTEE that the prescriptive period for the offenses with which respondents in OMB-0-96-0968 were charged should be computed from the discovery of the commission thereof and not from the day of such commission.\n\nThe assertion by the Ombudsman that the phrase \"if the same not be known\" in Section 2 of Act No. 3326 does not mean \"lack of knowledge\" but that the crime \"is not reasonably knowable\" is unacceptable, as it provides an interpretation that defeats or negates the intent of the law, which is written in a clear and unambiguous language and thus provides no room for interpretation but only application. [14]\nThe Court reiterated the above ruling in Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto (2001), [15] thus:\nIn cases involving violations of R.A. No. 3019 committed prior to the February 1986 Edsa Revolution that ousted President Ferdinand E. Marcos, we ruled that the government as the aggrieved party could not have known of the violations at the time the questioned transactions were made ( PCGG vs. Desierto, G.R. No. 140232, January 19, 2001, 349 SCRA 767; Domingo v. Sandiganbayan, supra, Note 14; Presidential Ad Hoc Fact Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto, supra, Note 16). Moreover, no person would have dared to question the legality of those transactions. Thus, the counting of the prescriptive period commenced from the date of discovery of the offense in 1992 after an exhaustive investigation by the Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans.\n\nAs to when the period of prescription was interrupted, the second paragraph of Section 2, Act No. 3326, as amended, provides that prescription is interrupted 'when proceedings are instituted against the guilty person. [16]\nRecords show that the act complained of was discovered in 1992. The complaint was filed with the Office of the Ombudsman on April 5, 1995, [17] or within three (3) years from the time of discovery. Thus, the filing of the complaint was well within the prescriptive period of 15 years.\n\nOn the issue of whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that no probable cause exists against respondents, it must be stressed that the Ombudsman is empowered to determine whether there exists reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and, thereafter, to file the corresponding information with the appropriate courts. [18] Settled is the rule that the Supreme Court will not ordinarily interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers without good and compelling reasons to indicate otherwise. [19] Said exercise of powers is based upon his constitutional mandate [20] and the courts will not interfere in its exercise. The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman, but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, innumerable petitions seeking dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Ombudsman will grievously hamper the functions of the office and the courts, in much the same way that courts will be swamped if they had to review the exercise of discretion on the part of public prosecutors each time they decided to file an information or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant. [21]\n\nWhile there are certain instances when this Court may intervene in the prosecution of cases, such as, (1) when necessary to afford adequate protection to the constitutional rights of the accused; (2) when necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions; (3) when there is a prejudicial question which is sub-judice; (4) when the acts of the officer are without or in excess of authority; (5) where the prosecution is under an invalid law, ordinance or regulation; (6) when double jeopardy is clearly apparent; (7) where the court has no jurisdiction over the offense; (8) where it is a case of persecution rather than prosecution; (9) where the charges are manifestly false and motivated by the lust for vengeance; and (10) when there is clearly no prima facie case against the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has been denied, [22] none apply here.\n\nAfter examination of the records and the evidence presented by petitioner, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the Ombudsman.\n\nNo grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the Ombudsman. Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. [23] The exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility. It must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law. [24]\n\nThe disquisition of GIO Diaz-Salcedo, in dismissing the criminal complaint, as approved by Ombudsman Desierto, is worth-quoting, thus:\nTaking into consideration the provisions of Administrative Order No. 13 and Memorandum Order No. 61, the subject transactions can not be classified as behest.\n\nEvaluation of the records of this case reveals that the loans acquired by NOCOSII are actually foreign loans from Midland Bank Ltd. of London. There were no direct loans released by PNB but merely credit accommodations to guaranty the loans from Midland Bank.\n\nAnent complainant's claim that the collaterals offered by NOCOSII are insufficient, it should be noted that under PNB Board Resolution No. 689 dated July 30, 1975, one of the conditions imposed to NOCOSII was the execution of contract assigning all NOCOSII's share of sugar and molasses to PNB. NOCOSII was also required to increase its paid up capital at P5,000,000.00 a year starting April 30, 1976 up to April 30, 1980 or a total of P25,000,000.00. In addition thereto, the stockholders of NOCOSII were required to pledge or assign all their present and future shares to PNB while the accommodation remains standing. The proposed plant site which was offered as collateral was estimated to cost P307,903,000.00. The foregoing collaterals offered by NOCOSII are more than sufficient to cover the loans of P333,465,260.00.\n\nFurthermore, since the loan was approved by PNB, it presupposes that all the required clearances were submitted by NOCOSII including the clearance from the Office of the President; and having complied with all the documentary requirements, NOCOSII became entitled to the release of the loan.\n\nComplainant further alleged that NOCOSII was undercapitalized because its paid up capital was only P50,000,000.00. Complainant, however, failed to consider the other assets of NOCOSII which also form part of its capital. x x x [25]\nThe finding of insufficiency of evidence or lack of probable cause by the Ombudsman is borne out by the evidence presented by petitioner: firstly, there were no direct loans released by PNB but merely credit accommodations to guaranty NOCOSII's foreign loans from Midland Bank Ltd. of London; secondly, NOCOSII effectively came under government control since 1975 when PNB acquired a majority of the voting rights in NOCOSII and was given the power to appoint a comptroller therein; thirdly, PNB's credit accommodations to NOCOSII between 1975 and 1981 in the aggregate sum of P333,465,260.00 were sufficiently secured by: (1) the Assignment of Subscription Rights and/or Pledge of Shares dated September 5, 1975 whereby NOCOSII officers pledged their shares of stock, representing 90% of NOCOSII's subscribed capital stock, and assigned their subscription rights to future stocks in favor of PNB; [26] (2) the Deed of Assignment dated September 5, 1975 whereby NOCOSII assigned its share of sugar and molasses from the operation of its sugar central located at Barrio Mateo, Matalam, North Cotabato in favor of PNB; [27] (3) the Joint and Solidary Agreement dated September 5, 1975 whereby the NOCOSII officers bound themselves jointly and severally liable with the corporation for the payment of NOCOSII's obligations to PNB; [28] (4) the Real Estate Mortgage dated October 2, 1981 whereby NOCOSII mortgaged various buildings, machineries and equipments, otherwise known as the NOCOSII Sugar Mill Plant, with an estimated value of P307,593,000.00 in favor of PNB; [29] and (5) the Chattel Mortgage with Power of Attorney dated October 2, 1981 whereby NOCOSII mortgaged various transportation, agricultural and heavy equipment in favor of the PNB; [30] fourthly, PNB imposed other conditions, such as, (1) the submission by NOCOSII of the Central Bank's approval of its foreign loans; (2) the submission by NOCOSII of the required clearances from the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and/or Presidential Committee on Sugar Industry (PHILSUGIN); (3) submission by NOCOSII of its milling contracts covering a total area of not less than 14,000 hectares; (4) submission by NOCOSII of the government permit that the planters can cultivate the required hectarage; (5) further increase in NOCOSII's total paid-in capital to P25,000,000.00 at P5,000,000.00 a year starting April 30, 1976 up to April 30, 1980; (6) deposit in NOCOSII's account with the PNB of all cash proceeds of NOCOSII's foreign loans the disposition of which shall be subject to the bank's control; and, (7) designation by the PNB of its own representatives in NOCOSII's Board of Directors and its own comptroller who shall have the authority to control all disbursements and receipts of funds of NOCOSII.<sup style=\"co</p>\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

COURT OF APPEALS, ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. \nD E C I S I O N\nPHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nIn this Petition for Review on Certiorari, Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB) impugns the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated 21 June 1995 finding it liable to Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (Atlas), as well as the Resolution [2] dated 12 September 1995 denying its Motion for Reconsideration. [3]\n\nThe antecedents follow.\n\nPCIB and, Manila Banking Corporation (MBC) were joint bidders in a foreclosure sale held on 20 December 1975 of assorted mining machinery and equipment previously mortgaged to them by the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. (PIM).\n\nFour (4) years later, Atlas agreed to purchase some of these properties owned jointly at that time by PCIB and MBC. The sale was evidenced by a Deed of Sale dated 8 February 1979, with the parties agreeing therein to an initial downpayment of P12,000,000.00 and the balance of P18,000,000.00 payable in six (6) monthly installments. It was also stipulated that the total purchase price would be finally adjusted to exclude items to be retained by the Bureau of Mines. The contract contained provisions expressly warranting the following: (1) full and sufficient title to the properties, (2) freeing the properties from all liens and encumbrances, (3) freeing Atlas from all claims and incidental actions of the National Mines and Allied Workers Union (NAMAWU), and (4) full rights and capacity of the seller to convey title to and effect peaceful delivery of the properties to Atlas. [4]\n\nThe NAMAWU claim stemmed from a labor dispute docketed as RB-VI-3322-75 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), where it obtained a favorable judgment against PIM in the amount of P4,298,307.77. This award was affirmed by the Court. [5] After the judgment became final and executory, a writ of execution was duly issued.\n\nIn compliance with the contract, on 12 February 1979, Atlas issued Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Check No. 003842 in the amount of P12,000,000.00 as downpayment, payable to both PCIB and MBC.\n\nIn a letter-agreement [6] dated 7 March 1979 between PCIB and MBC bearing the conformity of Atlas that was made a supplement to the Deed of Sale, the final purchase price was adjusted to P29,630,000.00.\n\nOn the following day, PCIB and MBC wrote Atlas requesting that subsequent installment payments of the balance be made in the following proportions: PCIB - 63.1579% and MBC - 36.8421%. The request was expressed through a letter [7] signed by Ruben G. Asedillo and Porfirio Q. Cabalu, Vice Presidents respectively of MBC and PCIB.\n\nOn 18 April 1979, Atlas paid to NAMAWU the amount of P4,298,307.77. This payment was made in compliance with the writ of garnishment issued on the same date against Atlas to satisfy the final judgment in favor of NAMAWU and against PIM.\n\nPCIB and MBC filed on 23 April 1979 a petition for certiorari with this Court, seeking to annul and set aside the order of garnishment and to enjoin Atlas from complying with it. The Court, in G.R. No. L-50402, dismissed the petition and sustained Atlas's rights as follows:\n. . . Atlas had the right to receive the properties free from any lien and encumbrance, and when the garnishment was served on it, it was perfectly in the right in slashing the P4,298,307.77 from the P30M it had to pay petitioners (PCIB, MBC) in order to satisfy the long existing and vested right of the laborers of financially moribund PIM, without any liability to petitioners for reimbursement thereof.\" [8] In the meantime, Atlas had made six (6) monthly payments in 1979 totaling P13,696,692.22, of which P8,650,543.18 or 63.1579% was received by PCIB.\n\nAccording to Atlas, apart from the downpayment of P12,000,000.00 and installment payments of P13,696,692.22, it should be credited with its payment of P4,298,307.77 to NAMAWU as a consequence of the garnishment with which the latter had secured together with corresponding P5,000.00 sheriff's fee. Thus, Atlas claims to have paid a total of P30,000,000.00, of which P370,000.00 was an overpayment. Following the payment allocations between PCIB and MBI, Atlas claimed that PCIB should reimburse it to the tune of P233,684.23. When PCIB refused to pay, Atlas sued PCIB to obtain reimbursement of the alleged overpayment.\n\nOn the other hand, PCIB contended that Atlas still owed it a total of P908,398.75. It also alleged that even before the writ of garnishment was served on Atlas, the judgment in favor of NAMAWU had already been partially satisfied in the amount of P601,260.00. On account of this earlier payment, PCIB argued that the total payments NAMAWU had received exceeded what it was entitled to by reason of the final judgment and, therefore, Atlas could not credit the full amount received by NAMAWU in satisfaction of the Atlas obligation to PCIB.\n\nThe trial court, in a Decision [9] dated 29 November 1990, upheld PCIB's position and ordered Atlas to pay P908,398.75, plus interest at the legal rate from the time of demand until payment of said amount. [10] It ruled:\nAfter a thorough analysis and evaluation of the evidence thus far adduced and remaining unrebutted, the Court is convinced that defendant only received the amount of P6,819,766.10, as its share out of the P12,000,000.00 downpayment, provided in the Deed of Sale, not P7,578,948.00 as claimed by plaintiff. The Court is furthermore convinced that plaintiff erroneously paid the amount of P4,298,307.77 to NAMAWU which payment was made pursuant to the writ of garnishment in NLRC Case No. RB-VI-3322-75. Before the service of the writ of garnishment on April 18, 1979, the judgment in NLRC Case had already been satisfied in the amount of P601,260.00 on account of several execution sales held on February 28, 1976 and October 20, 1976 and the remaining balance thereto at the time of the service of the writ of garnishment on plaintiff was only P3,697,[047].77. Certainly, this is the only amount which can be credited to plaintiff by defendant because 63.1579% of P3,697,047.77 is P2,334,977.74, according to letter-request of defendant PCIB and MBC to plaintiff dated March 8, 1979. Instead of paying NAMAWU the amount of P3,697,047.77 which is the correct amount, plaintiff paid the amount of P4,298,307.77. The Court of Appeals reversed the lower court by ordering PCIB to pay Atlas the sum of P233,654.23, plus interest at the legal rate from the date of the first demand on 3 September 1984, until fully paid, as well as the sum of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs of suit. The appellate court disposed of the case as follows:\nA careful examination of the evidences presented in the case, though, evidently show that appellee PCIB has no cause to blame appellant Atlas for its failure to receive what it maintains was a shortchange in the share of P12 Million downpayment. It must be emphasized that at the time the downpayment check was paid, the Deed of Sale did not mention any proportionate sharing of the proceeds thereof between PCIB and MBC implying a 50-50 sharing between the two (2) sellers. The 63.1579% for PCIB and 36.8421% was only made known and relayed to Atlas in a letter dated March 8, 1979 after the downpayment check of P12 Million had already been paid on February 12, 1979. Furthermore, the initial check was paid and received by Porfirio O. Cabalu, Jr., Vice-President of defendant-appellee PCIB. Apparently, after the check was deposited in the account of MBC, the latter issued its MBC Check No. 1652661 in the amount of P6,819,766.10 to PCIB, properly receipted under Official Receipt No. 466652 of PCIB. In other words, what the appellee herein receipted was the share given to it by Manilabank. Whether the same was short of what is legally entitled becomes an internal matter between MBC and PCIB, with Atlas having nothing to do with it. Legally, Atlas had effectively paid the P12 Million downpayment to both PCIB and MBC.\n\nAs regard the second item, the propriety of the P4,298,307.77 paid by Atlas to NAMAWU and incidental amount of P5,000.00 to the Sheriff by virtue of the Notice of Garnishment in the labor dispute NLRC Case No. RB-VI-331-75, had already been judicially settled in the case of \"PCIB and MBC versus NAMAWU-IMF, L-50402, August 1982, 115 SCRA 873.\" Said case is a Petition for Certiorari praying, inter-alia that the High Court orders [sic] the NLRC to stop delivery of the check of P4,298,307.77 (same check in this case) of private respondent Atlas and/or to stop payment to NAMAWU.\n\nRightfully so, with the above discussion and the conceded fact that Atlas made a P370,000.00 overpayment to PCIB and MBC, said amount should be ordered returned. And since mathematically, 63.1579% of P370,000.00 is P233,684.23, appellee PCIB should be ordered to pay back Atlas said amount with interest at the legal rate, being a forbearance of money, from the first demand until fully paid. Reasonable attorney's [fees] of P20,000.00 is likewise award[ed] to appellant Atlas for having been forced to litigate after its several prior lawful demands to collect from PCIB the overpayment, were obstinately and unjustly refused. [11] (Emphasis not ours.) PCIB moved for a reconsideration of the decision but the same was denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution dated 12 September 1995.\n\nPCIB is now before us. The instant petition is anchored on two grounds, namely: (1) the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court by disturbing the latter's factual findings and conclusions despite the absence of strong and cogent reasons: and (2) the Court of Appeals erred in finding that Atlas had complied with its obligation to PCIB. [12]\n\nPrefatorily, findings of facts of the Court of Appeals are final and conclusive and cannot be reviewed on appeal to this Court. [13] A deviation from this rule, however, is justified where the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals contradict those of the trial court. [14] In the case at bar, the contradictory findings of the courts below necessitate our review of the factual issues.\n\nThe controversy boils down into whether Atlas overpaid or underpaid PCIB. To resolve the conflicting claims, we must dispose of two issues: whether PCIB should settle for only P6,819,766.10 which it received out of the P12,000,000.00 downpayment or it is entitled to more than that, specifically 63.1579% of the downpayment; and whether Atlas should be fully credited for the amount of P4,298,307.77 it had paid to NAMAWU.\n\nLet us briefly recall the pertinent antecedents to appreciate the issues in a better light. There is no dispute that the total purchase price of the properties bought by Atlas was P29,630,000.00. Of this amount, PCIB claims that it is entitled to receive from Atlas the total of P18,713,685.77 or 63.1579% of the purchase price, pursuant to the letter dated 7 March 1979 of the P12,000,000.00 down payment made by Atlas to PCIB and MBC, and PCIB acknowledged that it had received P6,819,766.10. PCIB also admitted having received P8,650,543.18 as its share from the subsequent installment payments made by Atlas.\n\nOn the first issue, the Court of Appeals rejected PCIB's claim that it should received 63.1579% of the downpayment. It ruled in essence that PCIB cannot demand from Atlas more than what it got from MBC out of the downpayment remitted by Atlas to both PCIB and MBC.\n\nWe uphold the appellate court on this issue.\n\nThis case concerns a joint obligation, which is defined as an obligation where there is a concurrence of several creditors, or of several debtors, or of several debtors, or of several creditors and debtors, by virtue of which each of the creditors has a right to demand, and each of the debtors is bound to render, compliance with his proportionate part of the prestation which constitutes the object of the obligation. [15] Article 1208 [16] of the Civil Code mandates the equal sharing of creditors in the payment of debt in the absence of any law or stipulation to the contrary.\n\nPCIB is adamant in claiming that it only received P6,819,766.10 as its share in the downpayment. To prove its allegation, PCIB presented its own receipt [17] wherein it was clearly stated that PCIB received from Atlas the amount of P6,819,766.10.\n\nIt is beyond dispute that Atlas issued Hongkong Shanghai Bank Check No. 003842 in the sum of P12,000,000.00 with PCIB and MBC as joint payees as downpayment of the purchase price on 12 February 1979. The check was received by Porfirio Cabalu, Jr., a PCIB Vice-President. As admitted by the parties during trial, the check was afterwards deposited in the account of MBC. [18] Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the amount received by PCIB, as evidenced by the receipt, was given to it by MBC. The appellate court arrived at the same conclusion, to wit:\nApparently, after the check was deposited in the account of MBC, the latter issued its MBC Check No. 1652661 in the amount of P6,819,766.10 to PCIB, properly receipted under Official Receipt No. 466652 of PCIB. In other words, what the appellee herein receipted was the share given to it by Manilabank. Undeniably, there was yet no agreement as of that date concerning the corresponding share of each creditor. It was only on 8 March 1979 when PCIB communicated to Atlas the percentage of payments to be remitted to PCIB and MBC. Before said date, Atlas could be secure in the thought that the matter of sharing was best left to the creditors to decide.\n\nThus, we agree with the appellate court's conclusion that whatever deficiency PCIB is entitled from the P12,000,000.00 down payment had become an internal matter between it and MBC. [19] The obligation was deemed fulfilled to the extent of P12,000,000.00 on the part of Atlas when the check was received by a representative of PCIB and eventually deposited in the account of MBC.\n\nOn the second issue, PCIB posits that Atlas cannot be credited with the payment of the full amount of P4,298,307.77 because the remaining outstanding balance with respect to the NAMAWU judgment claim at the time of the service of the writ of garnishment on Atlas was only P3,697,047.77. Atlas, on the other hand, insists that the creditable payment to NAMAWU was P4,298,307.77, as upheld by the Supreme Court in NAMAWU v. PCIB . Accordingly, it is this amount which should be the basis in extracting the 63.1579% share of PCIB, which amounts to P2,714,720.92 and not P2,334,977.74 as erroneously asserted by PCIB. [20]\n\nThe appellate court upheld the position of Atlas on the second issue. We reverse the appellate court.\n\nWhile the original amount sought to be garnished was P4,298,307.77, the partial payment of P601,260.00 naturally reduced it to P3,697,047.77. Clearly, Atlas overpaid NAMAWU. It will be recalled that upon receipt of the writ of garnishment, Atlas immediately paid NAMAWU, without making any investigation or consultation with PCIB.\n\nArticle 1236 of the Civil Code applies in this instance. It provides that whoever pays for another may demand from the debtor what he has paid, except that if he paid without the knowledge or against the will of the debtor, he can recover only insofar as the payment has been beneficial to the debtor.\n\nPCIB is the debtor in this case, it having purchased along with MBC legally garnished properties, while Atlas is the third person who paid the obligation of the debtor without the latter's knowledge and consent. Since Atlas readily paid NAMAWU without the knowledge and consent of PCIB, Atlas may only recover from PCIB or, more precisely charge to PCIB, only the amount of payment which has benefited the latter.\n\nGenerally, the third person who paid another's debt is entitled to recover the full amount he had paid. The law, however, limits his recovery to the amount by which the debtor has been benefited, if the debtor has no knowledge of, or has expressed his opposition to such payment. Where the defenses that could have been set up by the debtor against the creditor were existing and perfected, a payment by a third person without the knowledge of the debtor cannot obligate the debtor to such third person to an amount more than what he could have been compelled by the creditor to pay. Thus, if the debt has been remitted, paid, compensated or prescribed, a payment by a third person would constitute a payment of what is not due; his remedy would be against the person who received the payment under such conditions, and not against the debtor who did not benefit from the payment. [21]\n\nThe trial court correctly ruled that the overpayment amounting to P601,260.00 should be recovered from NAMAWU. The remedy of Atlas in this case would be to proceed, not against PCIB, but against NAMAWU who was paid in excess, applying the principle that no person can unjustly enrich himself at the expense of another. [22]\n\nHaving established that there has been partial satisfaction of the judgment in the amount of P601,260.00, the remaining obligation of PCIB in the judgment account stood at P2,334,977.74. Consequently, this is the only amount which must be credited to Atlas.\n\nAs it stands, the total payments by Atlas amounted to only P29,398,739.99. Therefore, Atlas must settle P231,260.00, the balance of the purchase price, of which PCIB is entitled to receive P146,058.96 as its proportionate share.\n\nWHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, the petition is GRANTED in PART . The Decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and in lieu thereof Atlas is ORDERED to pay PCIB the sum of P146,058.96, with legal interest commencing from the time of first demand on 22 August 1985.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairman), Carpio, and Carpio-Morales, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] CA rollo, pp. 179-183.\n\n[2] Id. at 212.\n\n[3] Id. at 184-190.\n\n[4] RTC records, p. 8.\n\n[5] Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank and The Manila Banking Corporation v.

DE BRIGINO, P E T I T I O N E R, VS. DOMINADOR RAMOS AND FILOMENA RAMOS, R E S P O N D E N T S.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nThis petition assails the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated 25 January 1996 in CA-G.R. SP No. 38618 entitled, \"Serafin Brigino, et al. v. Dominador Ramos, et al.,\" which affirmed that of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB)-Central Office in DARAB Case No. 1968. The DARAB-Central Office had affirmed the ruling of the Provincial Adjudicator of Malolos, Bulacan, in Reg. Case No. 403-Bul-92, declaring respondents the lawful tenants of a parcel of land in Bulacan owned by Hilaria Ramos Vda. de Brigino and her spouse, the late Serafin Brigino, and thus respondents are entitled to security of tenure.\n\nThe details, as richly told by the DARAB, are beyond dispute:\n\nOn 10 July 1992, petitioner and her spouse filed a petition for Annulment and/or Cancellation of Agricultural Leasehold Contract against herein respondents Dominador Ramos and Filomena Ramos before the Provincial Adjudicator of Malolos, Bulacan.\u00a0 Petitioner and her spouse alleged that they are the registered owners of the subject landholding with an area of 11,451 square meters located at Malibong Bata, Pandi, Bulacan.\u00a0 The petition further stated that petitioner is the sister of respondent Dominador Ramos while respondent Filomena Ramos is the surviving spouse of another brother named Pedro Ramos.\u00a0 The petition likewise averred that in the early months of 1991, petitioner and her spouse discovered that respondent Dominador and Pedro Ramos were able to register with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) two documents both entitled, \"Kasunduan ng Pamumuwisan\" dated 29 June 1973, without the knowledge and consent of the petitioner and her spouse as the signature of petitioner in those documents were forged. Hence, petitioner and her spouse prayed that said documents be declared void and the subject land as untenanted. [2]\n\nOn 31 August 1993, after attempts to amicably solve the dispute failed, the DARAB Provincial Adjudicator ruled for respondents. Despite the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) finding that the signatures of petitioner in the \"Kasunduan ng Pamumuwisan\" were forgeries, the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicators (PARAD) opined that the forgery does not suffice to render said documents null and void inasmuch as petitioner and her spouse are estopped from denying the existence of said documents in view of the fact that petitioner's spouse had issued rental receipts to respondents, which receipts strongly prove that they are occupying the subject land in the concept of tenants and that implied tenancy was, accordingly, perfectly established. The PARAD further disposed that such being the case, security of tenure must be accorded respondents in tune with Section 7 of Republic Act No. 3844. [3] It held.\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring respondents as bonafide and lawful tenants and to maintain in peaceful possession and cultivation of the landholding. [4] Disgruntled, petitioner and her spouse appealed the PARAD's Decision with the DARAB in DARAB Case No. 1968 which affirmed in toto the decision of the PARAD, with the following fallo of the Decision:\nWHEREFORE, finding no reversible error in the appealed Decision the instant appeal is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed Decision, dated August 31, 1993, is hereby Affirmed IN TOTO . [5] Unfazed, petitioner and her spouse elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals, which on 25 January 1996, affirmed the ruling of the DARAB. The dispositive portion of the Decision of the Court of Appeals provides:\nACCORDINGLY, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. No pronouncement as to costs. [6] Hence, the present petition for review, petitioner faulting the appellate court in finding that there was an implied tenancy relationship between her and respondents, positing that the essential requirements of a tenancy contract did not obtain in the case. Particularly, petitioner assails the Decision of the Court of Appeals on the following argument:\nTHE DISMISSAL OF THE PETITION FOR REVIEW BY THE COURT OF APPEALS IN CA-G.R. NO. 38618 ENTITLED SPS. SERAFIN BRIGINO AND HILARIA RAMOS VERSUS DOMINADOR RAMOS AND FILOMENA RAMOS IN EFFECT IS AN AFFIRMATION OF THE ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION OF THE DARAB ON THE FINDINGS OF SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISION OF THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT AND IS BASED ON ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION FROM FACTS. [7]\nThe issue of whether or not respondents are bona fide tenants of the subject landholding is the bedrock of the petition.\n\nPetitioner ardently claims that the NBI report that the questioned signatures and the standard/sample handwriting/signatures of Hilaria Ramos were not written by one and the same person stands to mean that the signatures of petitioner in the questioned documents, i.e. , the Kasunduan sa Pamumuwisan dated 09 June 1973, are forged.\u00a0 Thus, according to petitioner, there was no consent on her part to allow respondents to till the land in question and that absent the essential element of consent and sharing between the parties, no tenancy relationship can exist between them. Petitioner contends further that the receipts allegedly signed by her husband and her daughter could not be interpreted to constitute tenancy relationship between her and respondents, these harvests being, at best, gifts from respondents.\u00a0 In sum, petitioner avers that respondents are not legitimate tenants but mere usurper of rights having falsified the signature of the petitioner.\u00a0 Accordingly, she says that mere cultivation of the land by usurper cannot confer upon him by any legal right to work the land as tenant and enjoy the protection of security of tenure of the law. [8]\n\nRepublic Act No. 1199, also known as the Agricultural Tenancy Act of the Philippines, defines \"agricultural tenancy\" as:\n[T]he physical possession by a person of land devoted to agriculture belonging to, or legally possessed by, another for the purpose of production through the labor of the former and of the members of his immediate farm household, in consideration of which the former agrees to share the harvest with the latter, or to pay a price certain, either in produce or in money, or in both. [9]\nThe essential requisites of tenancy relationship based on the foregoing definition, as cited in cases of recent vintage, [10] are:\n1) that the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; 2) that the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; 3) that there is consent between the parties to the relationship; 4) that the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; 5) that there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and 6) that the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee.\nIn the present case, there is no dispute as to the presence of the foregoing elements, but the conflict lies in the elements of consent and sharing. To prove such sharing of harvests, a receipt or any other evidence must be presented. [11]\n\nThe appellate court, the DARAB and the PARAD found that an implied tenancy was created when petitioner and her spouse acquiesced in the taking over and cultivation of the land by respondents.\u00a0 The \"sharing\" is evidenced by the receipts given by petitioner's spouse and petitioner's daughter to respondents for the period of 1991-1992.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals and the Boards went on to rule that petitioner and her spouse were estopped from denying this implied tenancy in view of the fact that they had accepted shares of harvests from respondents.\n\nAt the outset, it is a time-honored rule that the question of whether there was an implied tenancy and sharing are basically questions of fact and the findings of the Court of Appeals and the Boards a quo are, generally, entitled to respect and nondisturbance, as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. [12] And substantial evidence has been defined to be such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and its absence is not shown by stressing that there is contrary evidence on record, direct or circumstantial, and where the findings of facts of the agrarian court are supported by substantial evidence, such findings are conclusive and binding on the appellate court. [13]\n\nWe find no compelling reason to apply the exception of nonconclusiveness of their factual findings inasmuch as their findings are based on substantial evidence.\n\nMore importantly, the Boards and the appellate court distinctly found that apart from the \" Kasunduan ng Pamumuwisan, \" there exists other evidence on record, taken together, which substantially establishes the fact of \"implied tenancy\" or that the tillage of the land was with the personal knowledge of petitioner, who is thereby estopped from claiming otherwise.\n\nIt is glittering from the petition itself that petitioner had personal knowledge of the fact that her husband, the late Serafin Brigino, and their daughter, a certain \"Dra. Cinco,\" had issued receipts to respondents for the produce that they had given corresponding to petitioner's share of the harvest of the land being tilled by respondents.\u00a0 We find to be far from tenable the contention of petitioner that said shares of the harvests covered by the receipts were merely \"gifts\" from respondents. [14] Far from the gullible victim that she now claims to be, petitioner had, from the start, consented to respondents' tillage of the land in question and had unswervingly received her proper share of the harvest.\n\nThe fact that petitioner and respondents are siblings [15] and that the latter are in actual possession and cultivation of the subject farmland since the 1960s [16] \u2013 a fact which petitioner does not deny \u2013 are tell-tale signs of respondents' contention that petitioner had consented to their tillage of the land as far back as the 1960s and they have since then been giving her share of the harvest, although the practice of requiring receipts for the shares of petitioner started only in 1991, when respondents ceased to be in petitioner's good graces and in anticipation of a looming legal brawl.\n\nIndeed, as explained by respondents, it is not uncommon for siblings to balk at formalities and legalities, such as requiring receipts, it being commonly resorted to among families only in case of a brewing rift between them and in anticipation of a legal scuffle.\u00a0 And, if indeed, respondents were deforciants of the land, why did petitioner, who knew all along of respondents' possession and cultivation thereof, wait until 1992 before she sought the ejectment of respondents from the said premises?\n\nIn fine, there exists substantial evidence on record to boost the findings of the Boards and the Court of Appeals that petitioner and her husband consented to respondents' cultivation of the land in the concept of tenants and that the element of \"sharing\" is present, as shown by the receipts for the period of 1991-1992. Indeed, tenancy is not a purely factual relationship dependent on what the alleged tenant does upon the land.\u00a0 It is also a legal relationship. [17] Here, all the essential requisites of tenancy relationship are obtaining.\n\nAs adroitly enunciated by the DARAB \u2013 x x x In short, the tenancy relationship based on alleged forged documents was nonetheless legitimized by an implied contract clearly established by all the facts taken together.\n\nHaving established their status as de jure tenants, respondents are entitled to security of tenure x x x.\u00a0 As elucidated in the case of Bernardo vs. Court of Appeals x x x - \"security of tenure of a tenant is a legal concession to agricultural lessees which they value as life itself and deprivation of their landholdings is tantamount to deprivation of their only means of livelihood.\" [18]\nThe above findings of the DARAB are entitled to great weight, nay , finality considering that the findings of the Boards are unquestionably factual issues that have been discussed and ruled upon by them and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 We cannot depart from such findings.\u00a0 Findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect, but finality when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. [19] Such findings deserve full respect and, without justifiable reason, ought not to be altered, modified or reversed. [20]\n\nWHEREFORE , the present petition is hereby DENIED .\u00a0 The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 25 January 1996 in CA-G.R. SP No. 38618 is hereby AFFIRMED.

NO. 132284, February 28, 2006 ]\n\nTELENGTAN BROTHERS & SONS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. UNITED STATES LINES, INC. AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nTELENGTAN BROTHERS & SONS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. UNITED STATES LINES, INC. AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nThru this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitioner Telengtan Brothers & Sons, Inc. (Telengtan) seeks the reversal and setting aside of the decision [1] dated January 8, 1998 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 18349 which affirmed in toto the decision dated January 10, 1985 [2] of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 38, finding petitioner liable to respondent United States Lines, Inc. (U.S. Lines) for demurrage and damages.\n\nPetitioner Telengtan is a domestic corporation doing business under the name and style La Suerte Cigar & Cigarette Factory, while respondent U.S. Lines is a foreign corporation engaged in the business of overseas shipping. During the period material, the provisions of the Far East Conference Tariff No. 12 were specifically made applicable to Philippine containerized cargo from the U.S. and Gulf Ports, effective with vessels arriving at Philippine ports on and after December 15, 1978. After that date, consignees who fail to take delivery of their containerized cargo within the 10-day free period are liable to pay demurrage charges.\n\nAs recited in the decision under review, the factual antecedents may be summarized as follows:\n\nOn June 22, 1981, respondent U.S. Lines filed a suit against petitioner Telengtan seeking payment of demurrage charges plus interest and damages. Docketed as Civil Case No. R-81-1196 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila and raffled to Branch 38 thereof, the complaint alleged that between the years 1979 and 1980, goods belonging to petitioner loaded on containers aboard its (respondent's) vessels arrived in Manila from U.S. ports. After the 10-day free period, petitioner still failed to withdraw its goods from the containers wherein the goods had been shipped. Continuing, respondent U.S. Lines alleged that petitioner incurred on all those shipments a demurrage in the total amount of P94,000.00 which the latter refused to pay despite repeated demands.\n\nIn its amended answer with compulsory counterclaim, petitioner Telengtan, as defendant a quo , disclaims liability for the demanded demurrage, alleging that it has never entered into a contract nor signed an agreement to be bound by any rule on demurrage. It likewise maintains that, absent an obligation to pay respondent who made no proper or legal demands in the first place, there is justifiable reason to refuse payment of the latter's unwarranted claims. By way of counterclaim, petitioner states that, upon arrival of the conveying vessels, it presented the Bills of Lading (B/Ls) and all other pertinent documents covering seven (7) shipments and demanded from respondent delivery of all the goods covered by the aforesaid B/Ls, only to be informed that respondent had already unloaded the goods from the container vans, stripped them of their contents which contents were then stored in warehouses. Petitioner further states that respondent had refused to deliver the goods covered by the B/Ls and required petitioner to pay the amount of P123,738.04 before the goods can be released. It thus prays that respondent be ordered to pay the aforestated amount with interest.\n\nAfter due proceedings, the trial court found for respondent U.S. Lines, as plaintiff therein, and accordingly rendered judgment, as follows:\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court finds [petitioner] liable to [respondent] for demurrage incurred in the amount of P99,408.00 which sum will bear interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the complaint till full payment thereof plus attorney's fees in the amount of 20% of the total sum due, all of which shall be recomputed as of the date of payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 1250 of the Civil Code. Exemplary damages in the amount of P80,000.00 are also granted. The counterclaim is dismissed. Costs against [petitioner]. (Words in bracket ours) [3]\nParty explains the trial court in its decision: [4]\nIn other words, contrary to [petitioner's] contentions, both the provisions of the contract between the parties, in this case the bill of lading, and the interpretation given by the higher courts to these provisions are to the effect that demurrage may be lawfully collected. As a matter of fact, [respondent U.S. Lines] has submitted official receipts showing that on many other and previous occasions, [petitioner] paid demurrage to [respondent] (Exhibits \"F\", \"F-1\" to \"F-4\", \"G\", \"G-1\" to \"G-4\", \"H\", \"H-1\" to \"H-4\", and \"I\", \"I-1\" to \"I-3\"). [Petitioner] is, therefore, in estoppel to claim that it did not know of demurrage being charged by [respondent] and that it had not agreed to it since these exhibits show that [petitioner] knew of this demurrage and by paying for the same, it in effect, agreed to the collection of demurrage.\n\nx x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\n\nOn the other hand, [petitioner] claims that [respondent] company owes them the far larger sum of P123,738.04 by way of damages allegedly suffered by their goods when [respondent] company removed these goods from its cargo vans and deposited them in bonded warehouses without its consent. It is not disputed that [respondent] company did not [sic] in fact remove these goods belonging to [petitioner] from its vans and deposited them in warehouses. However, this was done by authority of the Bureau of Customs and for that purpose, [respondent] addressed a letter-request to the Collector of Customs, for permission to remove the goods of defendant from its vans (Exhibit \"L\"). xxx.\n\nx x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\n\nThe Court finds that the charges for warehousing were necessary expenses covered by the terms of the bill of lading which the consignee was responsible for. There is therefore now no necessity of discussing whether or not the counterclaim of [petitioner] had prescribed or not. Neither is there any question of bad faith on the part of [respondent]. When it requested for authority to remove [petitioner's] consigned goods from its vans and deposited them in warehouses, [respondent] had already given consignee sufficient time to take delivery of the shipment. This, [petitioner] chose not to do. Instead, it sat pat by the telephone calling without making any positive effort to check up on the shipment or arrange for its delivery to its factory. Once arrived at the port, the shipment was available to consignee for its proper delivery and receipt and the carrier discharged of its responsibility therefor. Rather, by its inaction, [petitioner] was guilty of bad faith. Once it had received the notice of arrival of the carrier in port, it was incumbent on consignee to put wheels in motion in order that the shipment could be delivered to it. The inaction of [petitioner] would only indicate that it had no intention of taking delivery except at its own convenience thus preventing carrier from taking on other shipments and from leaving port. Such unexplained and unbusiness-like delay smacks highly of bad faith on the part of [petitioner] rather than of the [respondent]. (Words in bracket, added). Appealing to the CA, whereat its recourse was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 18349 , petitioner contended that the trial court erred in (1) holding it liable for demurrage, (2) dismissing its counterclaim, and (3) awarding exemplary damages and attorney's fees to respondent.\n\nAs stated at the outset, however, the CA, in its assailed Decision dated January 8, 1998 , [5] affirmed in toto the judgment of the trial court.\n\nUndaunted, petitioner is now with this Court via the present recourse, imputing to the CA the following errors: xxx in concluding that it [petitioner] was the one at fault in not withdrawing its cargo from the container vans in which the goods were originally shipped despite documentary evidence and written admissions of private respondent to the contrary.\n\nxxx in affirming the trial court's order for the recomputation of the judgment award in accordance with Article 1250 of the Civil Code contrary to existing jurisprudence and without any evidence at all to support it. [6]\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\n\nIt is undisputed that the goods subject of petitioner's counterclaim and covered by seven (7) B/Ls with Shipper's Reference Nos. S-16844, S-16846, S-16848, S-17748, S-17750, S-17749 and S-17751 [7] were loaded for shipment to Manila on respondent's vessels in container vans on a \"House/House Containers-Shippers Load, Stowage and Count\" basis. This shipping arrangement means that the shipping company's container vans are to be brought to the shipper for loading of its goods; that from the shipper's warehouse, the goods in container vans are brought to the shipping company for shipment; that the shipping company, upon arrival of its ship at the port of destination, is to deliver the container vans to the consignee's compound or warehouse; and that the shipper (consignee) is supposed to load, stow and count the goods from the container van. [8] Likewise undisputed is the fact that the container vans containing the goods covered by three (3) of the aforesaid B/Ls, particularly those with Shipper's Reference Nos. S-17748, S-17750 and S-17751, [9] were delivered to a warehouse, stripped of their contents and the contents deposited thereat. [10]\n\nOn the argument that the respondent, upon the foregoing undisputed facts, violated its contractual obligation to deliver when, instead of delivering the goods to the petitioner as consignee thereof, it deposited the same in bonded warehouse/s, petitioner would now score the CA for finding it at fault for non-withdrawal of its cargo from the container vans within the 10-day free demurrage period. Pressing the point, petitioner argues that, since the CA drew an erroneous conclusion from an undisputed set of facts, petitioner now asserts that the matter of who is at fault - its first assigned error - could be treated as a legal issue and not a question of fact.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Court sustain the CA's stance faulting the petitioner for not taking delivery of its cargo from the container vans within the 10-day free period, an inaction which led respondent to deposit the same in warehouse/s.\n\nIt may be that, when the relevant facts are undisputed, the question of whether or not the conclusion deduced therefrom by the CA is correct is a question of law properly cognizable by this Court. [11] However, it has also been held that all doubts as to the correctness of such conclusions will be resolved in favor of the disposing court. [12] So it must be in this case.\n\nAt any rate, the Court finds that petitioner's first contention raises a question of fact rather than of law. And settled is the rule that factual findings of the CA, particularly those confirmatory of that of the trial court, as here, are binding on this Court, [13] save for the most compelling of reasons, like when they are reached arbitrarily. [14]\n\nAs it were, however, the conclusion of the CA on who contextually is the erring party was not exactly drawn from a vacuum, supported as such conclusion is by the records of the case. What the CA wrote with some measure of logic commends itself for concurrence:\nHowever, ... We find that [petitioner] was the one at fault in not withdrawing its cargo from the containers wherein the goods were shipped within the ten (10)-day free period. Had it done so, then there would not have been any need of depositing the cargo in a warehouse.\n\nIt is incumbent upon the carrier to immediately advise the consignee of the arrival of the goods for if it does not, it continues to be liable for the same until the consignee has had reasonable opportunity to remove them.\n\nSound business practice dictates that the consignee, upon notification of the arrival of the goods, should immediately get the cargo from the carrier especially since it has need of it. xxx.\n\nAppellant tries to shift the blame on the [respondent] by stating that it was not informed beforehand of the latter's intention to deliver the goods to a warehouse. It likewise alleges that it does not know where to contact [respondent] for it argues that the person manning the latter's office would only hold office for a few hours, if not always out. But had it taken the necessary steps of inquiring for the address of [respondent] from the proper government offices, then it would have succeeded in finding the latter's address.\n\nJudging from the [petitioner's] way of conducting business in the past, We come to the conclusion that it is used to paying demurrage charges. Exhibits \"H\" and \"I\" are certainly proofs of appellant's practice of not getting its cargo from the carrier immediately upon notification of the goods' arrival. [15] (Words in bracket added.)\nIt cannot be over-emphasized that the container vans were stripped of their cargo with the prior authorization of the Bureau of Customs. The trial court said as much, thus:\nIt is not disputed that [respondent] company did not [sic] in fact remove these goods belonging to [petitioner] from its vans and deposited them in warehouses. However, this was done by authority of the Bureau of Customs and for that purpose, [respondent] addressed a letter-request to the Collector of Customs, for permission to remove the goods of [petitioner] from its vans (Exhibit \"L\"). The corresponding authority was granted by the Bureau of Customs to do so as evidenced by a van permit... (Exhibit \"M\"). In other words, while [respondent] admits that it removed the goods of [petitioner] from its vans and deposited them in various warehouses, there is no question that this was done by authority of the Bureau of Customs which is the proper agency of the government charged with the supervision and regulation of maritime commerce.\nVerily, the authority secured from the Bureau of Customs is indicative of the bona fides of respondent's intention. And as held below, the authority thus acquired relieved respondent of its obligations under the B/Ls when it caused the containers to be stripped and the goods stored in bonded warehouses.\n\nNot lost on this Court is the fact that the B/Ls under which petitioner anchors its counterclaim allow the goods carried to be delivered to bonded warehouses for the shipper's and/or consignee's account if it does not take possession or delivery thereof as soon as they are at its disposal for removal. Section 17 of the Regular Long Form Inward B/L of the respondent [16] which is incorporated by reference to the Short Form of B/L [17] provides: The carrier shall not be required to give any notification whatsoever of arrival, discharge or any disposition of or action taken with respect to the goods, ... even though the goods are consigned to order with provision for notice to a named person.\n\nThe carrier or master may appoint a stevedore or any other persons to unload and take delivery of the goods and such delivery from ship's tackle shall be considered complete and all responsibility of the carrier shall then terminate.\n\nIt is agreed that when possession of the goods is received or taken by the customs or other authorities or by any operator of any lighter, craft, ... or other facilities whether selected by the carrier or master, shipper of consignee, whether public or private, such authority or person shall be considered as having received possession and delivery of the goods solely as agent of and on behalf of the shipper and consignee, .... Also if the consignee does not take possession or delivery of the goods as soon as the goods are at the disposal of the consignee for removal, the goods shall be at their own risk and expense, delivery shall be considered complete and the carrier may, subject to carrier's liens, send the goods to store, warehouse, put them on lighters or other craft, put them in possession of authorities, dump, permit to lie where landed or otherwise dispose of them, always at the risk and expense of the goods , and the shipper and consignee shall pay and indemnify the carrier for any loss, damage, fine, charge or expense whatsoever suffered or incurred in so dealing with or disposing of the goods, or by reason of the consignee's failure or delay in taking possession and delivery as provided herein. (Emphasis Ours)\nOn the second issue raised, the Court finds as erroneous the trial court's decision, as affirmed by the CA, for the recomputation of the judgment award as of the date of payment in accordance with Article 1250 of the Civil Code.\n\nIn calling for the application of the aforementioned provision, respondent urged that judicial notice be taken of the succeeding devaluations of the peso vis-\u00e1-vis the US dollar since the time the proceedings began in 1981. According to respondent, the computation of the amount thus due from the petitioner should factor in such peso devaluations. [18]\n\nArticle 1250 of the Civil Code states:\nIn case an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the currency stipulated should supervene, the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of payment, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.\nExtraordinary inflation or deflation, as the case may be, exists when there is an unusual increase or decrease in the purchasing power of the Philippine peso which is beyond the common fluctuation in the value of said currency, and such increase or decrease could not have been reasonably foreseen or was manifestly beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time of the establishment of the obligation. [19] Extraordinary inflation can never be assumed; he who alleges the existence of such phenomenon must prove the same. [20]\n\nThe Court holds that there has been no extraordinary inflation within the meaning of Article 1250 of the Civil Code. Accordingly, there is no plausible reason for ordering the payment of an obligation in an amount different from what has been agreed upon because of the purported supervention of extraordinary inflation.\n\nAs it were, respondent was unable to prove the occurrence of extraordinary inflation since it filed its complaint in 1981. Indeed, the record is bereft of any evidence, documentary or testimonial, that inflation, nay, an extraordinary one, existed. Even if the price index of goods and services may have risen during the intervening period, [21] this increase, without more, cannot be considered as resulting to \"extraordinary inflation\" as to justify the application of Article 1250. The erosion of the value of the Philippine peso in the past three or four decades, starting in the mid-sixties, is, as the Court observed in Singson vs. Caltex (Phil), Inc ., [22] characteristics of most currencies. And while the Court may take judicial notice of the decline in the purchasing power of the Philippine currency in that span of time, such downward trend of the peso cannot be considered as the extraordinary phenomenon contemplated by Article 1250 of the Civil Code. Furthermore, absent an official pronouncement or declaration by competent authorities of the existence of extraordinary inflation during a given period, as here, the effects of extraordinary inflation, if that be the case, are not to be applied.\n\nLest it be overlooked, Article 1250 of the Code, as couched, clearly provides that the value of the peso at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall control and be the basis of payment of the contractual obligation, unless there is \"a greement to the contrary.\" It is only when there is a contrary agreement that extraordinary inflation will make the value of the currency at the time of payment, not at the time of the establishment of obligation, the basis for payment. [23] The Court, in Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Fernando A. Pedrosa , [24] formulated the same rule in the following wise:\nIn other words, an agreement is needed for the effects of an extraordinary inflation to be taken into account to alter the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation which, as a rule, is always the determinative element, to be varied by agreement that would find reason only in the supervention of extraordinary inflation or deflation.\nTo be sure, neither the trial court, the CA nor respondent has pointed to any provision of the covering B/Ls whence respondent sourced its contractual right under the premises where the defining \"agreement to the contrary\" is set forth. Needless to stress, the Court sees no need to speculate as to the existence of such agreement, the burden of proof on this regard being on respondent.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the order for recomputation as of the date of payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 1250 of the Civil Code is deleted.\n\nCosts against petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez and Azcuna, JJ. , concur.\nCorona, J.

REGALADO, JR., RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nHerein petitioners, the spouses Pedro Regalado and Zanita Regalado, have come to this Court via this appeal [1] by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to nullify and set aside the following issuances of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Kalibo, Aklan, Branch 8, in its Spl. Civil Action No. 4518, to wit:\nOrder dated July 26, 1995 , [2] granting the petition for appointment of a receiver embodied in the main complaint filed by respondents, and directing such receiver to put up a bond;\n\nDecision dated November 28, 1997 , [3] declaring the parcel of fishpond land subject of the case as the common property of all the parties; ordering the partition of the same into nine (9) equal parts; requiring petitioners to render an accounting of the produce of said fishpond starting 1980 until actual partition is effected; ordering petitioners to pay jointly and severally attorney's fees and litigation expenses and other costs; and ordering the appointment of a receiver agreeable to all parties upon the filing of the bond for receivership;\n\nOrder dated January 14, 1998 , [4] dismissing the appeal filed by petitioners for failure to file their record on appeal and to pay the appellate court docket and other lawful fees; and\n\nOrder dated May 19, 1998, [5] denying petitioners' petition for relief from judgment. The facts:\n\nPetitioner Pedro M. Regalado, married to co-petitioner Zanita F. Regalado, and respondents Abraham, Cirilo, Isidro, Ciriaco, Jorge, Lucio, and Apolonio, all surnamed Regalado, and Juliana R. Abello (hereinafter collectively referred to as respondents), are the children of the deceased spouses Apolonio Regalado and Sofia Regalado.\n\nIt appears that as early as 1929, the parties' parents had been in possession of a 40-hectare fishpond which the parents developed and even leased to third persons for a time. At one time, their father leased part of the fishpond property to one Benjamin Roxas for a period of nine (9) years commencing January 6, 1972 to January 6, 1981. However, in 1980, before the termination of the lease contract with Roxas, petitioner Pedro Regalado with one of the respondents, Ciriaco Regalado, forcibly took possession of the fishpond from its lessee.\n\nUpon the death of their father, respondents demanded from petitioner-spouses who are in the possession of the entire fishpond, the partition thereof. Respondents alleged that petitioners refused and merely requested for another three (3) years to be in possession of the subject property.\n\nAgain, in 1989, respondents reiterated their demand for partition but petitioners again refused and once more requested that they be allowed to remain in possession and usufruct of the property for five (5) more years after all the litigations concerning the same shall have been terminated, reasoning out that they have not yet recovered all their expenses in developing and recovering possession of the fishpond from third persons.\n\nIn 1992, respondents again demanded for partition but as before, petitioners again refused. Hence, on August 20, 1992, in the RTC of Kalibo, Aklan, respondents filed against petitioners a complaint for Partition of Real Estate, Accounting, Damages and Appointment of a Receiver , [6] thereat docketed as Spl. Civil Action No. 4518 which was raffled to Branch 8 of the court.\n\nIn their Answer, petitioner-spouses, as defendants a quo, claimed that the fishpond in question was not part of the hereditary estate of their parents as it is a public land covered by a Fishpond Lease Agreement. They argued that even if it were to be considered as part of the hereditary estate of the parents, respondents as plaintiffs below are not entitled to share equally in the fishpond property as it was allegedly only petitioner Pedro Regalado who recovered the actual physical possession of the same from third persons. Petitioners also claimed that respondents did not keep their part in the agreement to let the spouses recover all the expenses they incurred in the development and re-possession of the subject fishpond and to enjoy sole usufruct thereof for five (5) years.\n\nOn May 31, 1993, respondents filed in Spl. Civil Case No. 4518, a verified Petition for Receivership , [7] thereunder alleging that there was a compelling need for the appointment of a receiver to safeguard the property and its produce from being wasted or materially injured on account of petitioners' failure to pay the real estate taxes and fishpond rentals due thereon. Respondents further averred that the property and the income derived therefrom are in danger of being lost or misappropriated by petitioners who were allegedly constructing their own house thereat out of the income of the fishpond, throwing lavish parties frequently and getting heavily indebted to several persons.\n\nPetitioners opposed the petition for receivership, claiming that mere co-ownership does not justify the appointment of a receiver, since it was actually petitioner Pedro Regalado who risked his own life, spent his own money and time in recovering the fishpond without the other parties contributing a single centavo. Petitioners also argued in their opposition that the subject fishpond was public property which belongs to the Government, hence it would be folly and a waste of money to pay the real property taxes thereon in addition to the fishpond rentals to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR).\n\nIn the herein first assailed Order dated July 26, 1995 , [8] the trial court granted respondents' petition for receivership, explaining that respondents had rights and interests on the subject property, which property is in danger of being foreclosed by petitioners' creditors or forfeited by the Government for non-payment of taxes.\n\nAggrieved by the aforementioned Order, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that said Order was premature as they (petitioners) were not yet finished with their presentation of evidence in opposition to respondents' petition for the appointment of a receiver.\n\nActing thereon, the trial court issued an Order [9] on August 14, 1995 holding in abeyance the resolution of the receivership issue and setting the main case for trial on the merits.\n\nEventually, in the herein assailed Decision [10] dated November 28, 1997 , the trial court rendered judgment for the respondents, as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:\na) Declaring the parcel of fishpond land located at Barangay Camanci, Batan, Aklan described under paragraph 4 of the complaint and herein referred to as the land in question, the common property of all the parties herein;\n\nb) Ordering the partition of the fishpond in question into nine (9) equal parts, each part shall represent the share of Abraham M. Regalado, Cirilo M. Regalado, Isidro M. Regalado, Ciriaco M. Regalado, Jorge M. Regalado, Juliana R. Abello, Lucio M. Regalado, Apolonio M. Regalado, Jr. and Pedro M. Regalado in the following manner: Within thirty (30) days from receipt by the parties of this decision, they may make partition among themselves, if they are able to agree, by proper instruments of conveyance to be conformed by the court, otherwise, partition would be effected in accordance with Sections 3 or 5, Rule 69 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended;\n\nc) Ordering the defendants [now petitioners] to render an accounting of the produce of the fishpond in question starting 1980 when they first actually took possession of the same until actual partition of the property is effected among the parties;\n\nd) Ordering the defendants [now petitioners], to pay jointly and severally, the plaintiffs [now respondents] the sum of P10,000.00 attorney's fees, and litigation expenses and to pay the costs;\n\ne) Ordering, upon filing of the petitioners' [plaintiffs'] bond for receivership in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P100,000.00), the appointment of a receiver agreeable to all the parties, who is likewise directed to put-up a bond before assuming his duties as such in the amount which will be fixed later by this Court. [Words in brackets supplied]\n\nSO ORDERED.\nAgainst said decision, petitioners filed a Notice of Appeal [11] on December 17, 1997, therein making known their intention to take an appellate recourse to the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn the herein other assailed Order [12] dated January 14, 1998 , the lower court denied due course to petitioners' notice of appeal, saying that while the notice was timely filed, yet petitioners did not pay the appellate court docket and other lawful fees nor a record on appeal filed by them.\n\nWith the November 28, 1997 Decision having become final and executory, respondents filed a Motion for Execution which was granted by the trial court. In time, an Entry of Judgment [13] was made on February 27, 1998.\n\nThen, on March 10, 1998, petitioners, this time thru one Atty. Pedro Icamina who was without any proof of entry of appearance in the case either as new or collaborating counsel for the petitioners, filed a Petition for Relief from Order, [14] thereto attaching an affidavit of Atty. Tirol, petitioners' counsel on record about whom there is no indication of any withdrawal of appearance. In that affidavit, Atty. Tirol alleged that while his office received on January 19, 1998 a copy of the January 14, 1998 Order (denying due course to petitioners' appeal), his law clerk did not personally inform him about it and just placed said order on his table among the piles of legal and court papers, adding that he (Atty. Tirol) had several court hearings, not to mention the fact that he was a member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Aklan which required his attendance, all of which caused him to overlook the filing of the Record on Appeal. In the same pleading, Atty. Icamina attached petitioners' Record on Appeal and a check for P400.00 as appellate court docket fee.\n\nIn the herein last assailed Order [15] dated May 19, 1998 , the trial court denied petitioners' petition for relief on the ground that the instances therein cited by counsel \"are not those excusable negligence which warrant the granting of relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.\"\n\nHence, this recourse by the petitioners.\n\nWe DENY .\n\nAt the outset, it must be stressed that in seeking the reversal and setting aside of the assailed Orders and Decision of the trial court in its Spl. Civil Action No. 4518, petitioners came to us on a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n\nUnder Section 1(b), Rule 41 of the Rules, the denial of a petition for relief from judgment or an order disallowing or dismissing an appeal may only be challenged through the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65:\nSection 1. Subject of appeal. \u2013 An appeal may be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by these Rules to be appealable.\n\nNo appeal may be taken from:\n\nx x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x (b) An order denying a petition for relief or any similar motion seeking relief from judgment;\n\nx x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\n(d) An order disallowing or dismissing an appeal;\n\nx x x \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x x x\n\nIn all the above instances where the judgment or final order is not appealable, the aggrieved party may file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65. (Emphasis supplied)\nHence, in seeking the reversal of the trial court's Order dated May 19, 1998 which denied their petition for relief from judgment, petitioners, in coming to us via the vehicle of appeal by certiorari under Rule 45, have thus clearly availed of the wrong remedy.\n\nIn any event, even if petitioners came to us by certiorari under Rule 65, still the recourse must fail. For, from a perusal of the petition itself, it is quite apparent that no allegation of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court was ever presented by them, and even assuming there was, the same would still have to be dismissed.\n\nA petition for relief from denial of an appeal is governed by Rule 38, Section 2 of the Rules of Court which provides:\n\"Section 2. Petition for relief from denial of appeal. \u2013 When a judgment or final order is rendered by any court in a case, and a party thereto, by fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, has been prevented from taking an appeal, he may file a petition in such court and in the same case praying that the appeal be given due course.\"\nIn Tuason v. Court of Appeals, [16] we ruled:\n\"A petition for relief from judgment is an equitable remedy; it is allowed only in exceptional cases where there is no other available or adequate remedy. When a party has another remedy available to him, which may be either a motion for new trial or appeal from an adverse decision of the trial court, and he was not prevented by fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence from filing such motion or taking such appeal, he cannot avail himself of this petition. Indeed, relief will not be granted to a party who seeks avoidance from the effects of the judgment when the loss of the remedy at law was due to his own negligence; otherwise the petition for relief can be used to revive the right to appeal which had been lost thru inexcusable negligence.\" (Citations omitted)\nHere, there was no fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence that prevented petitioners from filing their Record on Appeal on time and paying the necessary appellate court docket and filing fees therefor. In the precise words of the trial court:\n\"The petition for relief stresses the reasons that the clerk of Atty. Tirol, a certain Ms. Nina Temporaza, in charged (sic) of receiving and filing of office papers failed to bring to the attention of Atty. Tirol the order of denial dated January 14, 1998 and secondly, Atty. Tirol due to pressure of work and court appearances and being an incumbent Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Aklan, thinking all the time that his notice of appeal filed by him was in order (sic).\n\nOn the first excuse, the Supreme Court in an analogous case had the occasion to rule, viz;\n\"The excuse offered by respondent Santos as reason for his failure to perfect in due time his appeal from the judgment of the Municipal Court, that counsel's clerk forgot to hand him the court notice, is the most hackneyed and habitual subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe the procedural requirements prescribed by the Rules of Court. x x x in the face of the Supreme Court repeated rulings (that) they are neither credible nor constitutive of excusable negligence\" ( Phil. Airlines Inc. vs. Arca, et al. , Vol. 19 SCRA 350).\nAs to the second excuse, the Supreme Court has this to say,\n\n\"Volume and pressure of work is not an excusable negligence. Moreover, the said petition was not based on a valid ground as We have consistently ruled that volume and pressure of work does not constitute mistake or excusable negligence as to warrant relief from judgment which is available only in exceptional cases\" ( Biscarra vs. Republic , 95 SCRA 248).\n\nFurthermore, the appellate court docket fee and other lawful fees are now required to be paid within the period for taking an appeal to the clerk of court which rendered the judgment or order appealed from. Failure to pay said fees on time is also a ground for dismissal of the appeal (Sec. 1 (c) of Rule 50).\"\nTo stress, even in the matter of questioning the trial court's Order dated January 14, 1998 denying due course to petitioners' appeal, the glaring fact reveals that again, petitioners availed of the wrong remedy.\n\nIt must be remembered that a party aggrieved by an order disallowing or dismissing an appeal may file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65. Sadly, however, petitioners erroneously filed an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45.\n\nAssuming, arguendo, that petitioners are allowed to take an appeal from said Order, we find no excusable negligence to merit the grant of the petition for relief.\n\nIn this case, it is undisputed that petitioners merely filed a Notice of Appeal. The Record on Appeal was belatedly filed, as in fact it was merely attached to their March 10, 1998 Petition for Relief from Order . What is more, no appellate docket and legal fees were paid with the filing of the Notice of Appeal. Petitioners merely harp on their counsel's alleged excusable negligence resulting in their failure to seasonably file their Record on Appeal and pay the required appellate docket and other legal fees.\n\nUnfortunately for petitioners, negligence, to be \"excusable,\" must be one which ordinary diligence and prudence could not have guarded against. [17] Again, petitioners' failure to file a Record on Appeal and pay the appellate docket fees cannot be considered as excusable negligence due to counsel's pressure of work and inadvertence of his office clerk.\n\nOn a final note, we emphasize that petitioners are bound by the acts of their counsel in the conduct of the instant case. They have to bear the consequences thereof. Petitioners cannot thereafter be heard to complain that the result might have been different had their counsel proceeded differently. So it is that in Rivera v. Court of Appeal s, [18] we ruled:\n\"xxx It has been held time and again that blunders and mistakes made in the conduct of the proceedings in the trial court as a result of the ignorance, inexperience or incompetence of counsel do not qualify as a ground for new trial. If such were to be admitted as valid reasons for reopening cases, there would never be an end to litigation so long as a new counsel could be employed to allege and show that the prior counsel had not been sufficiently diligent, experienced or learned. This will put a premium on the willful and intentional commission of errors by counsel, with a view to securing new trials in the event of conviction.\"\nThere must, therefore, be an end to this litigation.\n\nWe take this occasion to require Atty. Pedro Icamina to explain within ten (10) days from receipt hereof why he should not be proceeded administratively for filing the very petition in this case and the Petition for Relief from Order in the lower court without first entering his appearance as petitioners' counsel.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nCosts against petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona and Azcuna, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 8-17.\n\n[2] Rollo , p. 20.\n\n[3] Rollo, pp. 23-35.\n\n[4] Rollo, pp. 38 and 39\n\n[5] Rollo, pp.74-75.\n\n[6] Records, pp. 1-6.\n\n[7] Records, pp. 79-82.\n\n[8] Records, p. 183.\n\n[9] Records, p. 193.\n\n[10] Rollo, pp. 23-35; Records, pp. 281-293.\n\n[11] Records, p. 305.\n\n[12] See Footnote #4, supra ; Records, p. 317.\n\n[13] Records, pp. 513-514.\n\n[14] Rollo , pp. 40-44.\n\n[15] See Note #5, supra; Records, pp. 575-576.\n\n[16] 256 SCRA 158 (1996).\n\n[17] Insular Life Savings and Trust Company v.

LUIS K. S. LIM AND CHUA SIAM, EVARISTO LIM AND FEDERAL MEDICAL & PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., PETITIONERS, VS.THE COURT OF APPEALS, BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS AND LEVY DUKA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nBy this petition [1] for review on certiorari with prayer for a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction, petitioners seek the reversal and setting aside of the decision [2] dated July 10, 1998 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 47085, sustaining an earlier order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 55, denying petitioners\u2019 application for a writ of preliminary injunction in its Civil Case No. 97-86459.\n\nIn its Resolution [3] of February 15, 1999, as\u00a0 reiterated in its subsequent Resolution [4] of February 9, 2000, the Court, thru its Third Division, denied the prayer for a temporary restraining order.\n\nThe facts:\n\nHerein petitioners, the spouses Luis K.S. Lim and Chua Siam and Evaristo Lim are the principal stockholders of co-petitioner Federal Medical & Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a corporation engaged in the sale of medical equipment and supplies.\n\nIn the pursuit of their business, petitioners secured and obtained several loans from respondent Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) amounting to P11,000,000.00, to secure which the spouses Luis K.S. Lim and Chua Siam executed a real estate mortgage over their property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 29518. Petitioners defaulted in the payment of their loan obligation which had ballooned to P18,865,509.00, inclusive of interest and surcharges. Hence, in a letter dated September 15, 1997, BPI demanded of the petitioners to pay in full their overdue account.\u00a0 Responding thereto, petitioners sent two (2) letters to BPI submitting proposals to settle their matured obligation.\u00a0 Evidently, BPI rejected petitioners\u2019 offer because it filed with the respondent Sheriff of Manila, Levy Duka, a petition for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the real estate mortgage.\n\nOn December 8, 1997, petitioners, obviously to prevent the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings from taking place, filed with the RTC, Manila a complaint [5] for Damages and Injunction With Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order against BPI and the respondent sheriff.\u00a0 Docketed in said court as Civil Case No. 97-86459 and raffled to Branch 55 thereof, the complainants prayed, inter alia, for a writ of preliminary injunction to stop the foreclosure proceedings. On the same date - December 8, 1997 \u2013 the trial court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property scheduled on December 9, 1997, and set the hearing on the application for a writ of preliminary injunction to December 12, 1997.\n\nIn an Order [6] dated December 16, 1997, the trial court denied petitioners\u2019 application for preliminary injunction and lifted its earlier temporary restraining order, saying:\nThe writ of preliminary injunction prayed for should be DENIED. The plaintiffs\u2019 [petitioners\u2019] evidence simply consisted of proposals to settle the loans, or request for the re-structuring of the same.\u00a0 Plaintiffs did not deny that the loans were already due and that they have defaulted in the payment therefor. The foreclosure of the mortgage thus becomes a matter of right on the part of the defendant [respondent] bank, for such is the security of the loans and its foreclosure is a condition of the document.\u00a0 Of course, requests for extension to pay, or proposals for re-structuring of the loans, do not novate a contract and suspend its execution.\u00a0 This is academic and fundamental. The principles of offer and acceptance must be recalled. The fundamental requisites for the existence of an enforceable contract must be remembered.\n\nPlaintiffs have not thus established, so far, a clear legal right to the relief prayed for. Their right to the suspension of the foreclosure is not in esse, free from doubt and dispute.\u00a0 Necessarily, this Court cannot grant them the relief.\u00a0 (Word in bracket ours; Emphasis in the original).\nWith their motion for reconsideration having been denied by the trial court in its subsequent Order [7] of March 6, 1998, petitioners went to the CA on a petition for certiorari, thereat docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 47085 , insisting that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its orders of December 16, 1997 and March 6, 1998, supra , and claiming that they were deprived of due process because they received a copy of BPI\u2019s petition for extrajudicial foreclosure only on November 24, 1997 and that on the following day - November 25, 1997 \u2013 they received the respondent sheriff\u2019s Notice to Parties of Sheriff\u2019s Auction Sale [8] setting the auction sale on December 9, 1997. Petitioners thus argued that they had no opportunity to comment on BPI\u2019s foreclosure petition, adding that they were misled by BPI when the latter assured them that it would study their proposals when in fact a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure was already filed with the respondent sheriff.\n\nAs stated at the threshold hereof, the CA, in its decision [9] dated July 10, 1998, upheld the trial court\u2019s questioned orders and accordingly dismissed petitioners\u2019 recourse thereto. Partly says the CA in its assailed decision:\n\u2026This Court finds the respondent court's reasoning on this point to be unassailable.\u00a0 Thus:\nThe writ of preliminary injunction prayed for should be DENIED. The plaintiffs' evidence simply consisted of proposals to settle the loans, or a request for the re-structuring of the same.\u00a0 Plaintiffs\u00a0 did not deny that the loans were already due and that they have defaulted in the payment therefor. The foreclosure of the mortgage thus becomes a matter of right on the part of the defendant bank, for such is the security of the loans and its foreclosure is a condition of the document.\u00a0 Of course, requests for extension to pay, or proposals for re-structuring of the loans do not novate a contract and suspend its execution. This is academic and fundamental. The principles of offer and acceptance must be recalled. The fundamental requisites for the existence of an enforceable contract must be remembered.\n\nPlaintiffs have not thus established, so far, a clear legal right to the relief prayed for.\u00a0 Their right to the suspension of the foreclosure is not in esse, free from doubt and dispute.\u00a0 Necessarily, this Court cannot grant them the relief.\nBut even assuming that said Orders were wrong, the petition would be dismissed just the same because the writ of certiorari is unavailing in a situation like the one at bench.\u00a0 The sole office of the prerogative writ of certiorari is to correct errors of jurisdiction including the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. ( Flores v. NLRC, 253 SCRA 494) Thus, certiorari is not issued to cure errors in proceedings or correct erroneous conclusions of law or fact.\u00a0 As long as a court acts within its jurisdiction, any alleged errors committed in the exercise of its jurisdiction will amount to nothing more than errors of judgment which are reviewable by timely appeal and not by a special civil action of certiorari.\u00a0 ( Commissioner of BIR v. Court of Appeals, 257 SCRA 200 )\n\nOne last point.\u00a0 Again, even if hypothetically, said orders are erroneous, this Court cannot see in them nor in the annexes of the petition any streak of arbitrariness, capriciousness or any shred of oppressiveness, partiality, or prejudice on the part of the respondent court.\u00a0 Therefore, there was no grave abuse of discretion and this petition must fall.\nHence, this recourse by the petitioners.\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nAs in the CA, petitioners made much of their claim that respondent BPI misled and deprived them of any opportunity to question the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings instituted by it with the respondent sheriff.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded.\n\nThe requisites for preliminary injunctive relief are: (a) the invasion of right sought to be protected is material and substantial; (b) the right of the complainant is clear and unmistakable; and (c) there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage. [10]\n\nAs such, a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued only upon clear showing of an actual existing right to be protected during the pendency of the principal action.\u00a0 The twin requirements of a valid injunction are the existence of a right and its actual or threatened violations. [11] Thus, to be entitled to an injunctive writ, the right to be protected and the violation against that right must be shown. [12]\n\nHere, petitioners failed to show their right to injunctive relief against BPI.\u00a0 There is no clear showing of a right claimed which necessitates their entitlement to an injunctive writ. As aptly pointed out by both the CA and the trial court, petitioners\u2019 evidence simply consisted of proposals to settle the loans or a request for a restructuring of the same. Petitioners not once denied that their loans were already due and that they have defaulted in the payment thereof. Thus, the foreclosure of the mortgage becomes a matter of right on the part of BPI, for such is the purpose of security of the loans. To be sure, petitioners\u2019 requests for extensions to pay and proposals for restructuring of the loans, without BPI\u2019s acceptance , remain as that. Without more, those proposals neither novated the parties\u2019 mortgage contract nor suspended its execution.\u00a0\u00a0 In fine, petitioners failed to establish a clear and unmistakable right to be protected by the injunctive writ they seek.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA when it upheld the challenged RTC orders.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nCosts against petitioners.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson) and Azcuna, JJ ., concur.\nSandoval-Gutierrez, J., on sick leave\nCorona, J. , on leave.\n\n[1] In the petition,\u00a0 the Court of Appeals was impleaded as respondent.\u00a0 This was not necessary since this is a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[2] Penned by Associate Justice Hilarion L.

NO. 148072, July 10, 2007 ]\n\nFRANCISCO MAGESTRADO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND ELENA M. LIBROJO RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N\nFRANCISCO MAGESTRADO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND ELENA M. LIBROJO RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari seeks to reverse the (1) Resolution [1] dated 5 March 2001 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 63293 entitled, \" Francisco Magestrado v. Hon. Estrella T. Estrada, in her capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court, Branch 83 of Quezon City, People of the Philippines and Elena M. Librojo,\" which dismissed petitioner Francisco Magestrado's Petition for Certiorari for being the wrong remedy; and (2) Resolution [2] dated 3 May 2001 of the same Court denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nPrivate respondent Elena M. Librojo filed a criminal complaint [3] for perjury against petitioner with the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City, which was docketed as I.S. No. 98-3900.\n\nAfter the filing of petitioner's counter-affidavit and the appended pleadings, the Office of the City Prosecutor recommended the filing of an information for perjury against petitioner. Thus, Assistant City Prosecutor Josephine Z. Fernandez filed an information for perjury against petitioner with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City. Pertinent portions of the information are hereby quoted as follows:\nThat on or about the 27 th day of December, 1997, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and knowingly make an untruthful statement under oath upon a material matter before a competent officer authorized to receive and administer oath and which the law so require, to wit: the said accused subscribe and swore to an Affidavit of Loss before Notary Public Erlinda B. Espejo of Quezon City, per Doc. No. 168, Page No. 35, Book No. CLXXIV of her notarial registry, falsely alleging that he lost Owner's Duplicate Certificate of TCT No. N-173163, which document was used in support of a Petition For Issuance of New Owner's Duplicate Copy of Certificate of Title and filed with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, docketed as LRC# Q-10052 (98) on January 28, 1998 and assigned to Branch 99 of the said court, to which said Francisco M. Mag[e]strado signed and swore on its verification, per Doc. 413 Page 84 Book No. CLXXV Series of 1998 of Notary Public Erlinda B. Espejo of Quezon City; the said accused knowing fully well that the allegations in the said affidavit and petition are false, the truth of the matter being that the property subject of Transfer Certificate of Title No. N-173163 was mortgaged to complainant Elena M. Librojo as collateral for a loan in the amount of P 758,134.42 and as a consequence of which said title to the property was surrendered by him to the said complainant by virtue of said loan, thus, making untruthful and deliberate assertions of falsehoods, to the damage and prejudice of the said Elena M. Librojo. [4] The case was raffled to the MeTC of Quezon City, Branch 43, where it was docketed as Criminal Case No. 90721 entitled, \"People of the Philippines v. Francisco Magestrado.\"\n\nOn 30 June 1999, petitioner filed a motion [5] for suspension of proceedings based on a prejudicial question. Petitioner alleged that Civil Case No. Q-98-34349, a case for recovery of a sum of money pending before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 84, and Civil Case No. Q-98- 34308, a case for Cancellation of Mortgage, Delivery of Title and Damages, pending before the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 77, must be resolved first before Criminal Case No. 90721 may proceed since the issues in the said civil cases are similar or intimately related to the issues raised in the criminal action.\n\nOn 14 July 1999, MeTC-Branch 43 issued an Order [6] denying petitioner's motion for suspension of proceedings, thus:\nActing on the \"Motion for Suspension of Proceedings\" filed by the [herein petitioner Magestrado], thru counsel, and the \"Comment and Opposition thereto, the Court after an evaluation of the same, finds the aforesaid motion without merit, hence, is hereby DENIED, it appearing that the resolution of the issues raised in the civil actions is not determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\n\nHence, the trial of this case shall proceed as previously scheduled on July 19 and August 2, 1993 at 8:30 in the morning. On 17 August 1999, a motion [7] for reconsideration was filed by petitioner but was denied by the MeTC in an Order [8] dated 19 October 1999.\n\nAggrieved, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari [9] under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, with a prayer for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction before the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 83, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-99-39358, on the ground that MeTC Judge Billy J. Apalit committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying his motion to suspend the proceedings in Criminal Case No. 90721.\n\nOn 14 March 2000, RTC-Branch 83 dismissed the petition and denied the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, reasoning thus:\nScrutinizing the complaints and answers in the civil cases abovementioned, in relation to the criminal action for PERJURY, this Court opines and so holds that there is no prejudicial question involved as to warrant the suspension of the criminal action to await the outcome of the civil cases. The civil cases are principally for determination whether or not a loan was obtained by petitioner and whether or not he executed the deed of real estate mortgage involving the property covered by TCT No. N-173163, whereas the criminal case is for perjury which imputes upon petitioner the wrongful execution of an affidavit of loss to support his petition for issuance of a new owner\"s duplicate copy of TCT No. 173163. Whether or not he committed perjury is the issue in the criminal case which may be resolved independently of the civil cases. Note that the affidavit of loss was executed in support of the petition for issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. N-173163 which petition was raffled to Branch 99 of the RTC. x x x. [10] Again, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration [11] but this was denied by RTC- Branch 83 in an Order [12] dated 21 December 2000.\n\nDissatisfied, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a Petition for Certiorari [13] under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 63293. Petitioner alleged that RTC Judge Estrella T. Estrada committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying the Petition for Certiorari in Civil Case No. Q-99-39358, and in effect sustaining the denial by MeTC-Branch 43 of petitioner's motion to suspend the proceedings in Criminal Case No. 90721, as well as his subsequent motion for reconsideration thereof.\n\nOn 5 March 2001, the Court of Appeals dismissed [14] the Petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 63293 on the ground that petitioner's remedy should have been an appeal from the dismissal by RTC-Branch 83 of his Petition for Certiorari in Q-99-39358. The Court of Appeals ruled that:\nIs this instant Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 the correct and appropriate remedy?\n\nWe rule negatively.\n\nThe resolution or dismissal in special civil actions, as in the instant petition, may be appealed x x x under Section 10, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure and not by petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the same rules. Thus, the said rule provides:\n\nSection 10. Time for filing memoranda on special cases. In certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus cases, the parties shall file in lieu of briefs, their respective memoranda within a non-extendible period of thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice issued by the clerk that all the evidence, oral and documentary, is already attached to the record x x x.\n\nWHEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the instant Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is hereby DISMISSED. [15] The Court of Appeals denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration [16] in a Resolution [17] dated 3 May 2001.\n\nHence, petitioner comes before us via a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court raising the following issues:\nWhether or not the Orders of Judge Estrella T. Estrada dated March 14, 2000 denying petitioner's Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, and her subsequent Order dated December 21, 2000, denying the Motion for Reconsideration thereafter filed can only be reviewed by the Court of Appeals thru appeal under Section 10, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nWhether or not Judge Estrella T. Estrada of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 83, Quezon City, had committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of her jurisdiction in denying the Petition for Certiorari and petitioner's subsequent motion for reconsideration on the ground of a prejudicial question pursuant to the Rules on Criminal Procedure and the prevailing jurisprudence. After consideration of the procedural and substantive issues raised by petitioner, we find the instant petition to be without merit.\n\nThe procedural issue herein basically hinges on the proper remedy which petitioner should have availed himself of before the Court of Appeals: an ordinary appeal or a petition for certiorari . Petitioner claims that he correctly questioned RTC-Branch 83's Order of dismissal of his Petition for Certiorari in Civil Case No. Q-99-39358 through a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals. Private respondent and public respondent People of the Philippines insist that an ordinary appeal was the proper remedy.\n\nWe agree with respondents. We hold that the appellate court did not err in dismissing petitioner's Petition for Certiorari , pursuant to Rule 41, Section 2 of the Revised Rules of Court (and not under Rule 44, Section 10, invoked by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution dated 5 March 2001).\n\nThe correct procedural recourse for petitioner was appeal, not only because RTC-Branch 83 did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner's Petition for Certiorari in Civil Case No. Q-99-39358 but also because RTC-Branch 83's Order of dismissal was a final order from which petitioners should have appealed in accordance with Section 2, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court.\n\nAn order or a judgment is deemed final when it finally disposes of a pending action, so that nothing more can be done with it in the trial court. In other words, the order or judgment ends the litigation in the lower court. Au contraire, an interlocutory order does not dispose of the case completely, but leaves something to be done as regards the merits of the latter. [18] RTC-Branch 83's Order dated 14 March 2001 dismissing petitioner's Petition for Certiorari in Civil Case No. Q-99-39358 finally disposes of the said case and RTC-Branch 83 can do nothing more with the case.\n\nUnder Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, an appeal may be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by the Revised Rules of Court to be appealable. The manner of appealing an RTC judgment or final order is also provided in Rule 41 as follows:\n\nSection 2. Modes of appeal. \u2014\n(a) Ordinary appeal. \u2014 The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner. Certiorari generally lies only when there is no appeal nor any other plain, speedy or adequate remedy available to petitioners. Here, appeal was available. It was adequate to deal with any question whether of fact or of law, whether of error of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion or error of judgment which the trial court might have committed. But petitioners instead filed a special civil action for certiorari .\n\nWe have time and again reminded members of the bench and bar that a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court lies only when \"there is no appeal nor plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\" [19] Certiorari cannot be allowed when a party to a case fails to appeal a judgment despite the availability of that remedy, [20] certiorari not being a substitute for lost appeal. [21]\n\nAs certiorari is not a substitute for lost appeal, we have repeatedly emphasized that the perfection of appeals in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory but jurisdictional, and that the failure to perfect an appeal renders the decision of the trial court final and executory. This rule is founded upon the principle that the right to appeal is not part of due process of law but is a mere statutory privilege to be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law. Neither can petitioner invoke the doctrine that rules of technicality must yield to the broader interest of substantial justice. While every litigant must be given the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from constraints of technicalities, the failure to perfect an appeal within the reglementary period is not a mere technicality. It raises a jurisdictional problem as it deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction over the appeal. [22]\n\nThe remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive. [23] A party cannot substitute the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court for the remedy of appeal. The existence and availability of the right of appeal are antithetical to the availability of the special civil action for certiorari . [24] As this Court held in Fajardo v. Bautista [25] :\nGenerally, an order of dismissal, whether right or wrong, is a final order, and hence a proper subject of appeal, not certiorari. The remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive. Accordingly, although the special civil action of certiorari is not proper when an ordinary appeal is available, it may be granted where it is shown that the appeal would be inadequate, slow, insufficient, and will not promptly relieve a party from the injurious effects of the order complained of, or where appeal is inadequate and ineffectual. Nevertheless, certiorari cannot be a substitute for the lost or lapsed remedy of appeal, where such loss is occasioned by the petitioner's own neglect or error in the choice of remedies. On 21 December 2000, petitioner received a copy of the Order of the RTC-Branch 83 denying his motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his Petition for Certiorari in Civil Case No. Q-99-39358; hence, he had until 18 January 2001 within which to file an appeal with the Court of Appeals. The Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioner on 19 February 2001 with the Court of Appeals cannot be a substitute for the lost remedy of appeal. As petitioner failed to file a timely appeal, RTC-Branch 83's dismissal of his Petition for Certiorari had long become final and executory.\n\nFor this procedural lapse, the Court of Appeals correctly denied outright the Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioner before it.\n\nMoreover, there are even more cogent reasons for denying the instant Petition on the merits.\n\nIn the Petition at bar, petitioner raises several substantive issues. Petitioner harps on the need for the suspension of the proceedings in Criminal Case No. 90721 for perjury pending before MeTC-Branch 43 based on a prejudicial question still to be resolved in Civil Case No. Q-98-34308 (for cancellation of mortgage) and Civil Case No. Q-98-34349 (for collection of a sum of money) which are pending before other trial courts.\n\nFor clarity, we shall first discuss the allegations of petitioner in his complaint in Civil Case No. Q-98-34308 (for cancellation of mortgage) and that of private respondent in her complaint in Civil Case No. Q-98-34349 (for collection of a sum of money).\n\nCivil Case No. Q-98-34308 is a complaint for Cancellation of Mortgage, Delivery of Title and Damages filed on 8 May 1988 by petitioner against private respondent with RTC-Branch 77. Petitioner alleges that he purchased a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. N-173163 thru private respondent, a real estate broker. In the process of negotiation, petitioner was pressured to sign a Deed of Sale prepared by private respondent. Upon signing the Deed of Sale, he noticed that the Deed was already signed by a certain Cristina Gonzales as attorney-in-fact of vendor Spouses Guillermo and Amparo Galvez. Petitioner demanded from private respondent a special power of attorney and authority to sell, but the latter failed to present one. Petitioner averred that private respondent refused to deliver the certificate of title of the land despite execution and signing of the Deed of Sale and payment of the consideration. Petitioner was thus compelled to engage the services of one Modesto Gazmin, Jr. who agreed, for P100,000.00 to facilitate the filing of cases against private respondent; to deliver to petitioner the certificate of title of the land; and/or to cancel the certificate of title in possession of private respondent. However, Mr. Gazmin, Jr., did nothing upon receipt of the amount of P100,000.00 from petitioner. In fact, petitioner was even charged with perjury before the Office of the City Prosecutor, all because of Mr. Gazmin, Jr.'s wrongdoing. Petitioner further alleged that he discovered the existence of a spurious Real Estate Mortgage which he allegedly signed in favor of private respondent. Petitioner categorically denied signing the mortgage document and it was private respondent who falsified the same in order to justify her unlawful withholding of TCT No. N-173163 from petitioner. Thus, petitioner prayed for:\nThe cancellation of Real Estate Mortgage dated August 2, 1997 as null and void;\n\nAs well as to order [herein private respondent] to DELIVER the Owner's Duplicate Copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. N-173163 to [herein petitioner];\n\nCondemning [private respondent] to pay [petitioner] the sums of\n\na) P100,000.00 as MORAL DAMAGES;\n\nb) P50,000.00 as EXEMPLARY DAMAGES;\n\nc) P50,000.00 as Attorney's fees and\n\nd) Cost of suit.\n\nA general relief is likewise prayed for (sic) just and equitable under the premises. Civil Case No. Q-98-34349, [26] on the other hand, is a complaint for a sum of money with a motion for issuance of a writ of attachment filed by private respondent against petitioner on 14 May 1988 before RTC-Branch 84. Private respondent alleges that petitioner obtained a loan from her in the amount of P758,134.42 with a promise to pay on or before 30 August 1997. As security for payment of the loan, petitioner executed a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage covering a parcel of land registered under TCT No. N-173163. Petitioner pleaded for additional time to pay the said obligation, to which respondent agreed. But private respondent discovered sometime in February 1998 that petitioner executed an affidavit of loss alleging that he lost the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. N-173163, and succeeded in annotating said affidavit on the original copy of TCT No. N-173163 on file with the Registry of Deeds of Quezon City. Private respondent further alleges that she also discovered that petitioner filed a petition for issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. N-173163 with the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 98, docketed as LRC Case No. Q-10052. Private respondent demanded that petitioner pay his obligation, but the latter refused to do so. Resultantly, private respondent prayed for the following:\nThat upon filing of this Complaint as well as the Affidavit of attachment and a preliminary hearing thereon, as well as bond filed, a writ of preliminary attachment is (sic) by the Honorable Court ordering the Sheriff to levy [herein petitioner] property sufficient to answer [herein private respondent's] claim in this action;\n\nThat after due notice and hearing, judgment be rendered in [private respondent's] favor as against [petitioner], ordering the latter to pay the former the sum of P758,134.42 plus interest thereon at 5% per month from September 1997 up to the date of actual payment; actual damages in the sums of P70,000.00 each under paragraphs 11 and 12 of the complaint; P200,000.00 as moral damages; P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; twenty (20%) of the principal claim as attorney's fees plus P2,500.00 per appearance honorarium; and P60,000.00 as litigation expense before this Honorable Court.\n\n[Petitioner] prays for such further relief in law, justice and equity. As to whether it is proper to suspend Criminal Case No. 90721 for perjury pending final outcome of Civil Case No. Q-98-34349 and Civil Case No. Q-98-34308, we take into consideration Sections 6 and 7, Rule 111 of the Revised Rules of Court, which read:\nSec. 6. Suspension by reason of prejudicial question. \u2014 A petition for suspension of the criminal action based upon the pendency of a prejudicial question in a civil action may be filed in the office of the prosecutor or the court conducting the preliminary investigation. When the criminal action has been filed in court for trial, the petition to suspend shall be filed in the same criminal action at any time before the prosecution rests.\n\nSec. 7. Elements of prejudicial question. \u2014 The elements of a prejudicial question are: (a) the previously instituted civil action involves an issue similar or intimately related to the issue raised in the subsequent criminal action; and (b) the resolution of such issue determines whether or not the criminal action may proceed. The rationale behind the principle of suspending a criminal case in view of a prejudicial question is to avoid two conflicting decisions. [27]\n\nA prejudial question is defined as that which arises in a case the resolution of which is a logical antecedent of the issue involved therein, and the cognizance of which pertains to another tribunal. The prejudicial question must be determinative of the case before the court but the jurisdiction to try and resolve the question must be lodged in another court or tribunal. It is a question based on a fact distinct and separate from the crime but so intimately connected with it that it determines the guilt or innocence of the accused. [28]\n\nFor a prejudicial question in a civil case to suspend criminal action, it must appear not only that said case involves facts intimately related to those upon which the criminal prosecution would be based but also that in the resolution of the issue or issues raised in the civil case, the guilt or innocence of the accused would necessarily be determined.\n\nThus, for a civil action to be considered prejudicial to a criminal case as to cause the suspension of the criminal proceedings until the final resolution of the civil case, the following requisites must be present: (1) the civil case involves facts intimately related to those upon which the criminal prosecution would be based; (2) in the resolution of the issue or issues raised in the civil action, the guilt or innocence of the accused would necessarily be determined; and (3) jurisdiction to try said question must be lodged in another tribunal. [29]\n\nIf the resolution of the issue in the civil action will not determine the criminal responsibility of the accused in the criminal action based on the same facts, or there is no necessity \"that the civil case be determined first before taking up the criminal case,\" therefore, the civil case does not involve a prejudicial question. [30] Neither is there a prejudicial question if the civil and the criminal action can, according to law, proceed independently of each other. [31]\n\nHowever, the court in which an action is pending may, in the exercise of sound discretion, and upon proper application for a stay of that action, hold the action in abeyance to abide by the outcome of another case pending in another court, especially where the parties and the issues are the same, for there is power inherent in every court to control the disposition of cases on its dockets with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants. Where the rights of parties to the second action cannot be properly determined until the questions raised in the first action are settled, the second action should be stayed. [32]\n\nThe power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the cases on its dockets, considering its time and effort, those of counsel and the litigants. But if proceedings must be stayed, it must be done in order to avoid multiplicity of suits and prevent vexatious litigations, conflicting judgments, confusion between litigants and courts. It bears stressing that whether or not the trial court would suspend the proceedings in the criminal case before it is submitted to its sound discretion. [33]\n\nIndeed, a judicial order issued pursuant to the court's discretionary authority is not subject to reversal on review unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion. As the United States Supreme Court aptly declared in Landis v. North American Co., \"the burden of making out the justice and wisdom from the departure from the beaten truck lay heavily on the petitioner, less an unwilling litigant is compelled to wait upon the outcome of a controversy to which he is a stranger. It is, thus, stated that only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one case is compelled to stand aside, while a litigant in another, settling the rule of law that will define the rights of both is, after all, the parties before the court are entitled to a just, speedy and plain determination of their case undetermined by the pendency of the proceedings in another case. After all, procedure was created not to hinder and delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice.\" [34]\n\nAs stated, the determination of whether the proceedings may be suspended on the basis of a prejudicial question rests on whether the facts and issues raised in the pleadings in the civil cases are so related with the issues raised in the criminal case such that the resolution of the issues in the civil cases would also determine the judgment in the criminal case.\n\nA perusal of the allegations in the complaints show that Civil Case No. Q-98-34308 pending before RTC-Branch 77, and Civil Case No. Q-98-34349, pending before RTC-Branch 84, are principally for the determination of whether a loan was obtained by petitioner from private respondent and whether petitioner executed a real estate mortgage involving the property covered by TCT No. N-173163. On the other hand, Criminal Case No. 90721 before MeTC-Branch 43, involves the determination of whether petitioner committed perjury in executing an affidavit of loss to support his request for issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. N-173163.\n\nIt is evident that the civil cases and the criminal case can proceed independently of each other. Regardless of the outcome of the two civil cases, it will not establish the innocence or guilt of the petitioner in the criminal case for perjury. The purchase by petitioner of the land or his execution of a real estate mortgage will have no bearing whatsoever on whether petitioner knowingly and fraudulently executed a false affidavit of loss of TCT No. N-173163.\n\nMeTC-Branch 43, therefore, did not err in ruling that the pendency of Civil Case No. Q-98-34308 for cancellation of mortgage before the RTC-Branch 77; and Civil Case No. Q-98-34349 for collection of a sum of money before RTC-Branch 84, do not pose a prejudicial question in the determination of whether petitioner is guilty of perjury in Criminal Case No. 90721. RTC-Branch 83, likewise, did not err in ruling that MeTC-Branch 43 did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's motion for suspension of proceedings in Criminal Case No. 90721.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Resolutions dated 5 March 2001 and 3 May 2001of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 63293 are hereby AFFIRMED and the instant petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit. Accordingly, the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 43, is hereby directed to proceed with the hearing and trial on the merits of Criminal Case No. 90721, and to expedite proceedings therein, without prejudice to the right of the accused to due process.

NO. 135992, January 31, 2006 ]\n[ G.R. NO. 135992, January 31, 2006 ]\n\nEASTERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PHILIPPINES, INC. AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nEASTERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PHILIPPINES, INC. AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nOn July 23, 2004, the Court promulgated its Decision in the above-captioned case with the following dispositive portion:\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Order of the National Telecommunications Commissions dated November 10, 1997 in NTC Case No. 96-195 is AFFIRMED with the following modifications:\n\nRespondent International Communication Corporation, in accordance with Section 27 of NTC MC No. 11-9-93, is required to:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | Deposit in escrow in a reputable bank 20% of the investment required for the first two years of the implementation of the proposed project; and\n | \n(2) | Post a performance bond equivalent to 10% of the investment required for the first two years of the approved project but not to exceed P500 Million.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) Deposit in escrow in a reputable bank 20% of the investment required for the first two years of the implementation of the proposed project; and (2) Post a performance bond equivalent to 10% of the investment required for the first two years of the approved project but not to exceed P500 Million.\nwithin such period to be determined by the National Telecommunications Commission.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [1] Respondent now seeks a partial reconsideration of the portion of the Court's decision requiring it to make a 20% escrow deposit and to post a 10% performance bond. Respondent claims that Section 27 of NTC MC No. 11-9-93, which required the foregoing amounts, pertains only to applications filed under Executive Order No. 109 (E.O. No. 109) and not to applications voluntarily filed. In its Manifestation in support of the motion for partial reconsideration, respondent attached a letter from Deputy Commissioner and Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Kathleen G. Heceta, of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), stating thus:\nx x x\n\nPlease be informed that the escrow deposit and performance bond were required to public telecommunications entities to ensure that the mandated installation of local exchange lines are installed within three (3) years pursuant to EO 109 and RA 7925. Since your company has already complied with its obligation by the installation of more than 300,000 lines in Quezon City, Malabon City and Valenzuela City in the National Capital Region and Region V in early 1997, the escrow deposit and performance bond were not required in your subsequent authorizations. [2] In a Resolution dated October 4, 2004, the Court required petitioners and the NTC to file their respective comments on the motion. [3]\n\nSubsequently, in its Manifestation/Comment filed on January 11, 2005, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), in behalf of the NTC, likewise referred to the same letter of OIC Heceta and declared that it fully agrees with respondent that the escrow deposit and performance bond are not required in subsequent authorizations for additional/new areas outside its original roll-out obligation under the Service Area Scheme of E.O. No. 109.\n\nPetitioners did not file any comment and it was only after the Court issued a show cause and compliance Resolution on October 19, 2005 that petitioners manifested in their Entry of Special Appearance, Manifestation and Compliance dated November 25, 2005 that they have no further comments on respondent's motion for partial reconsideration. [4]\n\nThe Court has observed in its Decision that Section 27 of NTC MC No. 11-9-93 is silent as to whether the posting of an escrow deposit and performance bond is a condition sine qua non for the grant of a provisional authority. The NTC, through the OSG, explicitly clarified, which was not disputed by petitioners, that the escrow deposit and performance bond are not required in subsequent authorizations for additional/new areas outside its original roll-out obligation under E.O. No. 109. The OSG agreed with respondent's stance that since the provisional authority in this case involves a voluntary application not covered by the original service areas created by the NTC under E.O. No. 109, then it is not subject to the posting of an escrow deposit and performance bond as required by E.O. No. 109, but only to the conditions provided in the provisional authority. Further, the OSG adapted the ratiocination of the Court of Appeals on this matter, i.e., respondent was not subjected to the foregoing escrow deposit and performance bond requirement because the landline obligation is already outside its original roll-out commitment under E.O. No. 109. [5]\n\nThe NTC, being the government agency entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under its special and technical forte, and possessing the necessary rule-making power to implement its objectives, [6] is in the best position to interpret its own rules, regulations and guidelines. The Court has consistently yielded and accorded great respect to the interpretation by administrative agencies of their own rules unless there is an error of law, abuse of power, lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion clearly conflicting with the letter and spirit of the law. [7]\n\nIn City Government of Makati vs. Civil Service Commission, [8] the Court cited cases where the interpretation of a particular administrative agency of a certain rule was adhered to, viz.:\nAs properly noted, CSC was only interpreting its own rules on leave of absence and not a statutory provision in coming up with this uniform rule. Undoubtedly, the CSC like any other agency has the power to interpret its own rules and any phrase contained in them with its interpretation significantly becoming part of the rules themselves. As observed in West Texas Compress & Warehouse Co. v. Panhandle & S.F. Railing Co. -\n\nx x x\n\nThis principle is not new to us. In Geukeko v. Araneta this Court upheld the interpretation of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce of its own rules of procedure in suspending the period of appeal even if such action was nowhere stated therein. We said -\n\nx x x\n\nx x x It must be remembered that Lands Administrative Order No. 6 is in the nature of procedural rules promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources pursuant to the power bestowed on said administrative agency to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the proper discharge and management of the functions imposed by law upon said office. x x x x Recognizing the existence of such rule-making authority, what is the weight of an interpretation given by an administrative agency to its own rules or regulations? Authorities sustain the doctrine that the interpretation given to a rule or regulation by those charged with its execution is entitled to the greatest weight by the Court construing such rule or regulation, and such interpretation will be followed unless it appears to be clearly unreasonable or arbitrary (42 Am. Jur. 431). It has also been said that:\n\nx x x\n\nThe same precept was enunciated in Bagatsing v. Committee on Privatization where we upheld the action of the Commission on Audit (COA) in validating the sale of Petron Corporation to Aramco Overseas Corporation on the basis of COA's interpretation of its own circular that set bidding and audit guidelines on the disposal of government assets -\n\nThe COA itself, the agency that adopted the rules on bidding procedure to be followed by government offices and corporations, had upheld the validity and legality of the questioned bidding. The interpretation of an agency of its own rules should be given more weight than the interpretation by that agency of the law it is merely tasked to administer (underscoring supplied) .\n\nGiven the greater weight accorded to an agency's interpretation of its own rules than to its understanding of the statute it seeks to implement, we simply cannot set aside the former on the same grounds as we would overturn the latter. More specifically, in cases where the dispute concerns the interpretation by an agency of its own rules, we should apply only these standards: \"Whether the delegation of power was valid; whether the regulation was within that delegation; and if so, whether it was a reasonable regulation under a due process test.\" An affirmative answer in each of these questions should caution us from discarding the agency's interpretation of its own rules. (Emphasis supplied) Thus, the Court holds that the interpretation of the NTC that Section 27 of NTC MC No. 11-9-93 regarding the escrow deposit and performance bond shall pertain only to a local exchange operator's original roll-out obligation under E.O. No. 109, and not to roll-out obligations made under subsequent or voluntary applications outside E.O. No. 109, should be sustained.\n\nIN VIEW THEREOF, respondent's Motion for Partial Reconsideration is GRANTED . The Court's Decision dated July 23, 2004 is AMENDED , the dispositive portion of which should read as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The Order of the National Telecommunications Commission dated November 10, 1997 in NTC Case No. 96-195 is AFFIRMED.\n\nthereby deleting the order requiring respondent to make a 20% escrow deposit and to post a 10% performance bond.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno,\u00a0 Callejo, Sr ., Tinga, and Chico-Nazario , JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, p. 312.\n\n[2] Id., p. 327.\n\n[3] Id., p. 329.\n\n[4] Id., p. 355.\n\n[5] Id., pp. 339-340.\n\n[6] Section 11, Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended; Section 15, Executive Order No. 546.\n\n[7] Melendres, Jr. vs. COMELEC, 377 Phil. 275.\n\n[8] 426 Phil. 631, 646-649.\n\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

THE CITY OF PASIG, HON. MARIETTA A. LEGASPI, IN HER CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PASIG CITY, BRANCH 165 AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nSANDOVAL GUTIERREZ, J.:\n\nWhere the taking by the State of private property is done for the benefit of a small community which seeks to have its own sports and recreational facility, notwithstanding that there is such a recreational facility only a short distance away, such taking cannot be considered to be for public use. Its expropriation is not valid. In this case, the Court defines what constitutes a genuine necessity for public use.\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari assails the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated October 31, 1997 in CA-G.R. SP No. 41860 affirming the Order [2] of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 165, Pasig City, dated May 7, 1996 in S.C.A. No. 873. Likewise assailed is the Resolution [3] of the same court dated November 20, 1998 denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThe facts of the case are:\n\nPetitioner Lourdes Dela Paz Masikip is the registered owner of a parcel of land with an area of 4,521 square meters located at Pag-Asa, Caniogan, Pasig City, Metro Manila.\n\nIn a letter dated January 6, 1994, the then Municipality of Pasig, now City of Pasig, respondent, notified petitioner of its intention to expropriate a 1,500 square meter portion of her property to be used for the \"sports development and recreational activities\" of the residents of Barangay Caniogan. This was pursuant to Ordinance No. 42, Series of 1993 enacted by the then Sangguniang Bayan of Pasig.\n\nAgain, on March 23, 1994, respondent wrote another letter to petitioner, but this time the purpose was allegedly \"in line with the program of the Municipal Government to provide land opportunities to deserving poor sectors of our community.\"\n\nOn May 2, 1994, petitioner sent a reply to respondent stating that the intended expropriation of her property is unconstitutional, invalid, and oppressive, as the area of her lot is neither sufficient nor suitable to \"provide land opportunities to deserving poor sectors of our community.\"\n\nIn its letter of December 20, 1994, respondent reiterated that the purpose of the expropriation of petitioner's property is \"to provide sports and recreational facilities to its poor residents.\"\n\nSubsequently, on February 21, 1995, respondent filed with the trial court a complaint for expropriation, docketed as SCA No. 873. Respondent prayed that the trial court, after due notice and hearing, issue an order for the condemnation of the property; that commissioners be appointed for the purpose of determining the just compensation; and that judgment be rendered based on the report of the commissioners.\n\nOn April 25, 1995, petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint on the following grounds:\n\nI\nPLAINTIFF HAS NO CAUSE OF ACTION FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, CONSIDERING THAT:\n\n(A) THERE IS NO GENUINE NECESSITY FOR THE TAKING OF THE PROPERTY SOUGHT TO BE EXPROPRIATED.\n\n(B) PLAINTIFF HAS ARBITRARILY AND CAPRICIOUSLY CHOSEN THE PROPERTY SOUGHT TO BE EXPROPRIATED.\n\n(C) EVEN ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT DEFENDANT'S PROPERTY MAY BE EXPROPRIATED BY PLAINTIFF, THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY TO BE EXPROPRIATED FAR EXCEEDS SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND PESOS (P78,000.00)\n\nII\n\nPLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT IS DEFECTIVE IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, CONSIDERING THAT:\n\n(A) PLAINTIFF FAILS TO ALLEGE WITH CERTAINTY THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPROPRIATION.\n\n(B) PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE PREREQUISITES LAID DOWN IN SECTION 34, RULE VI OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE; THUS, THE INSTANT EXPROPRIATION PROCEEDING IS PREMATURE.\n\nIII\n\nTHE GRANTING OF THE EXPROPRIATION WOULD VIOLATE SECTION 261 (V) OF THE OMNIBUS ELECTION CODE.\n\nIV\n\nPLAINTIFF CANNOT TAKE POSSESSION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY BY MERELY DEPOSITING AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIFTEEN PERCENT (15%) OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY BASED ON THE CURRENT TAX DECLARATION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY. [4] On May 7, 1996, the trial court issued an Order denying the Motion to Dismiss, [5] on the ground that there is a genuine necessity to expropriate the property for the sports and recreational activities of the residents of Pasig. As to the issue of just compensation, the trial court held that the same is to be determined in accordance with the Revised Rules of Court.\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the trial court in its Order of July 31, 1996. Forthwith, it appointed the City Assessor and City Treasurer of Pasig City as commissioners to ascertain the just compensation. This prompted petitioner to file with the Court of Appeals a special civil action for certiorari, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 41860. On October 31, 1997, the Appellate Court dismissed the petition for lack of merit. Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated November 20, 1998.\n\nHence, this petition anchored on the following grounds:\nTHE QUESTIONED DECISION DATED 31 OCTOBER 1997 (ATTACHMENT \"A\") AND RESOLUTION DATED 20 NOVEMBER 1998 (ATTACHMENT \"B\") ARE CONTRARY TO LAW, THE RULES OF COURT AND JURISPRUDENCE CONSIDERING THAT:\n\nI\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THERE IS GENUINE NECESSITY FOR THE TAKING OF THE PETITIONER'S PROPERTY.\n\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE PUBLIC USE REQUIREMENT FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN HAS BEEN COMPLIED WITH.\n\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT RESPONDENT CITY OF PASIG HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN.\nTHE COURT A QUO'S ORDER DATED 07 MAY 1996 AND 31 JULY 1996, WHICH WERE AFFIRMED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS, EFFECTIVELY AMOUNT TO THE TAKING OF PETITIONER'S PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW:\n\nII\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN APPLYING OF RULE ON ACTIONABLE DOCUMENTS TO THE DOCUMENTS ATTACHED TO RESPONDENT CITY OF PASIG'S COMPLAINT DATED 07 APRIL 1995 TO JUSTIFY THE COURT A QUO'S DENIAL OF PETITIONER'S RESPONSIVE PLEADING TO THE COMPLAINT FOR EXPROPRIATION (THE MOTION TO DISMISS DATED 21 APRIL 1995).\n\nIII\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN APPLYING THE RULE ON HYPOTHETICAL ADMISSION OF FACTS ALLEGED IN A COMPLAINT CONSIDERING THAT THE MOTION TO DISMISS FILED BY PETITIONER IN THE EXPROPRIATION CASE BELOW WAS THE RESPONSIVE PLEADING REQUIRED TO BE FILED UNDER THE THEN RULE 67 OF THE RULES OF COURT AND NOT AN ORIDNARY MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER RULE 16 OF THE RULES OF COURT.\nThe foregoing arguments may be synthesized into two main issues - one substantive and one procedural. We will first address the procedural issue.\n\nPetitioner filed her Motion to Dismiss the complaint for expropriation on April 25, 1995. It was denied by the trial court on May 7, 1996. At that time, the rule on expropriation was governed by Section 3, Rule 67 of the Revised Rules of Court which provides:\n\"SEC. 3. Defenses and objections. \" Within the time specified in the summons, each defendant, in lieu of an answer, shall present in a single motion to dismiss or for other appropriate relief, all his objections and defenses to the right of the plaintiff to take his property for the use or purpose specified in the complaint. All such objections and defenses not so presented are waived. A copy of the motion shall be served on the plaintiff's attorney of record and filed with the court with proof of service.\" The motion to dismiss contemplated in the above Rule clearly constitutes the responsive pleading which takes the place of an answer to the complaint for expropriation. Such motion is the pleading that puts in issue the right of the plaintiff to expropriate the defendant's property for the use specified in the complaint. All that the law requires is that a copy of the said motion be served on plaintiff's attorney of record. It is the court that at its convenience will set the case for trial after the filing of the said pleading. [6]\n\nThe Court of Appeals therefore erred in holding that the motion to dismiss filed by petitioner hypothetically admitted the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint, \"specifically that there is a genuine necessity to expropriate petitioner's property for public use.\" Pursuant to the above Rule, the motion is a responsive pleading joining the issues. What the trial court should have done was to set the case for the reception of evidence to determine whether there is indeed a genuine necessity for the taking of the property, instead of summarily making a finding that the taking is for public use and appointing commissioners to fix just compensation. This is especially so considering that the purpose of the expropriation was squarely challenged and put in issue by petitioner in her motion to dismiss.\n\nSignificantly, the above Rule allowing a defendant in an expropriation case to file a motion to dismiss in lieu of an answer was amended by the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect on July 1, 1997. Section 3, Rule 67 now expressly mandates that any objection or defense to the taking of the property of a defendant must be set forth in an answer.\n\nThe fact that the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 41860 on October 31, after the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure took effect, is of no moment. It is only fair that the Rule at the time petitioner filed her motion to dismiss should govern. The new provision cannot be applied retroactively to her prejudice.\n\nWe now proceed to address the substantive issue.\n\nIn the early case of US v. Toribio , [7] this Court defined the power of eminent domain as \"the right of a government to take and appropriate private property to public use, whenever the public exigency requires it, which can be done only on condition of providing a reasonable compensation therefor.\" It has also been described as the power of the State or its instrumentalities to take private property for public use and is inseparable from sovereignty and inherent in government. [8]\n\nThe power of eminent domain is lodged in the legislative branch of the government. It delegates the exercise thereof to local government units, other public entities and public utility corporations, [9] subject only to Constitutional limitations. Local governments have no inherent power of eminent domain and may exercise it only when expressly authorized by statute. [10] Section 19 of the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) prescribes the delegation by Congress of the power of eminent domain to local government units and lays down the parameters for its exercise, thus:\n\"SEC. 19. Eminent Domain . - A local government unit may, through its chief executive and acting pursuant to an ordinance, exercise the power of eminent domain for public use, purpose or welfare for the benefit of the poor and the landless, upon payment of just compensation, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and pertinent laws: Provided, however, That, the power of eminent domain may not be exercised unless a valid and definite offer has been previously made to the owner and such offer was not accepted: Provided, further, That, the local government unit may immediately take possession of the property upon the filing of expropriation proceedings and upon making a deposit with the proper court of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of the property based on the current tax declaration of the property to be expropriated: Provided, finally, That, the amount to be paid for expropriated property shall be determined by the proper court, based on the fair market value at the time of the taking of the property.\" Judicial review of the exercise of eminent domain is limited to the following areas of concern: (a) the adequacy of the compensation, (b) the necessity of the taking, and (c) the public use character of the purpose of the taking. [11]\n\nIn this case, petitioner contends that respondent City of Pasig failed to establish a genuine necessity which justifies the condemnation of her property. While she does not dispute the intended public purpose, nonetheless, she insists that there must be a genuine necessity for the proposed use and purposes. According to petitioner, there is already an established sports development and recreational activity center at Rainforest Park in Pasig City, fully operational and being utilized by its residents, including those from Barangay Caniogan. Respondent does not dispute this. Evidently, there is no \"genuine necessity\" to justify the expropriation.\n\nThe right to take private property for public purposes necessarily originates from \"the necessity\" and the taking must be limited to such necessity. In City of Manila v. Chinese Community of Manila, [12] we held that the very foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is a genuine necessity and that necessity must be of a public character. Moreover, the ascertainment of the necessity must precede or accompany and not follow, the taking of the land. In City of Manila v. Arellano Law College, [13] we ruled that \"necessity within the rule that the particular property to be expropriated must be necessary, does not mean an absolute but only a reasonable or practical necessity, such as would combine the greatest benefit to the public with the least inconvenience and expense to the condemning party and the property owner consistent with such benefit.\"\n\nApplying this standard, we hold that respondent City of Pasig has failed to establish that there is a genuine necessity to expropriate petitioner's property. Our scrutiny of the records shows that the Certification [14] issued by the Caniogan Barangay Council dated November 20, 1994, the basis for the passage of Ordinance No. 42 s. 1993 authorizing the expropriation, indicates that the intended beneficiary is the Melendres Compound Homeowners Association, a private, non-profit organization, not the residents of Caniogan. It can be gleaned that the members of the said Association are desirous of having their own private playground and recreational facility. Petitioner's lot is the nearest vacant space available. The purpose is, therefore, not clearly and categorically public. The necessity has not been shown, especially considering that there exists an alternative facility for sports development and community recreation in the area, which is the Rainforest Park, available to all residents of Pasig City, including those of Caniogan.\n\nThe right to own and possess property is one of the most cherished rights of men. It is so fundamental that it has been written into organic law of every nation where the rule of law prevails. Unless the requisite of genuine necessity for the expropriation of one's property is clearly established, it shall be the duty of the courts to protect the rights of individuals to their private property. Important as the power of eminent domain may be, the inviolable sanctity which the Constitution attaches to the property of the individual requires not only that the purpose for the taking of private property be specified. The genuine necessity for the taking, which must be of a public character, must also be shown to exist.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition for review is GRANTED. The challenged Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 41860 are REVERSED. The complaint for expropriation filed before the trial court by respondent City of Pasig, docketed as SCA No. 873, is ordered DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J ., Puno, Corona, Azcuna, and Garcia, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo at 75-86.

NO. 144723, February 27, 2006 ]\n\nLARRY ESTACION, PETITIONER, VS. NOE BERNARDO, THRU AND HIS GUARDIAN AD LITEM ARLIE BERNARDO, CECILIA BANDOQUILLO AND GEMINIANO QUINQUILLERA, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nLARRY ESTACION, PETITIONER, VS. NOE BERNARDO, THRU AND HIS GUARDIAN AD LITEM ARLIE BERNARDO, CECILIA BANDOQUILLO AND GEMINIANO QUINQUILLERA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore us is a petition for review on certiorari filed by Larry Estacion (petitioner) seeking to annul the Decision dated April 17, 2000 [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 41447 which affirmed in toto the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dumaguete City, Branch 41, Negros Oriental, holding petitioner and his driver Bienvenido Gerosano (Gerosano) liable for damages for the injury sustained by Noe Bernardo (respondent Noe). Also assailed is the appellate court's Resolution dated August 16, 2000 [2] denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nIn the afternoon of October 16, 1982, respondent Noe was going home to Dumaguete from Cebu, via Bato and Tampi. At Tampi, he boarded a Ford Fiera passenger jeepney with plate no. NLD 720 driven by respondent Geminiano Quinquillera (Quinquillera), owned by respondent Cecilia Bandoquillo (Bandoquillo), and was seated on the extension seat placed at the center of the Fiera. From San Jose, an old woman wanted to ride, so respondent Noe offered his seat. Since the Fiera was already full, respondent Noe hung or stood on the left rear carrier of the vehicle. Somewhere along Barangay Sto. Ni\u00f1o, San Jose, Negros Oriental, between kilometers 13 and 14, the Fiera began to slow down and then stopped by the right shoulder of the road to pick up passengers. Suddenly, an Isuzu cargo truck, owned by petitioner and driven by Gerosano, which was traveling in the same direction, hit the rear end portion of the Fiera where respondent Noe was standing. Due to the tremendous force, the cargo truck smashed respondent Noe against the Fiera crushing his legs and feet which made him fall to the ground. A passing vehicle brought him to the Silliman University Medical Center where his lower left leg was amputated.\n\nPolice investigation reports showed that respondent Noe was one of the 11 passengers of the Fiera who suffered injuries; that when the Fiera stopped to pick up a passenger, the cargo truck bumped the rear left portion of the Fiera; that only one tire mark from the front right wheel of the cargo truck was seen on the road. A sketch of the accident was drawn by investigator Mateo Rubia showing the relative positions of the two vehicles, their distances from the shoulder of the road and the skid marks of the right front wheel of the truck measuring about 48 feet.\n\nOn February 18, 1993, respondent Noe, through his guardian ad litem Arlie Bernardo, filed with the RTC of Dumaguete City a complaint [3] for damages arising from quasi delict against petitioner as the registered owner of the cargo truck and his driver Gerosano. He alleged that the proximate cause of his injuries and suffering was the reckless imprudence of Gerosano and petitioner's negligence in the selection of a reckless driver and for operating a vehicle that was not roadworthy. He prayed for actual damages, loss of income, moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and costs of suit.\n\nPetitioner and his driver Gerosano filed their Answer [4] denying the material allegations in the complaint. They, in turn, filed a third party complaint [5] against respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera, as owner and driver respectively of the Fiera. They alleged that it was the reckless imprudence of respondent driver Quinquillera and his clear violation of the traffic rules and regulations which was the proximate cause of the accident and asked for indemnification for whatever damages they would be sentenced to pay. Respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera filed their Answer to the third party complaint asking for the dismissal of the third party complaint and for payment of attorney's fees.\n\nDriver Gerosano was charged criminally for reckless imprudence resulting to multiple physical injuries with damage to property before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Pamplona-Amlan and San Jose, Negros Oriental. On November 16, 1987, the MCTC rendered its decision [6] finding him guilty of the crime charged and was sentenced to four months and one day to two years and four months and to pay the costs.\n\nOn February 18, 1993, the RTC rendered its judgment in the civil case, [7] the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering defendants Gerosano and Estacion, to pay plaintiff, jointly or solidarily, the following:\nP129,584.20 for actual damages in the form of medical and hospitalization expenses;\n\nP50,000.00 for moral damages, consisting of mental anguish, moral shock, serious anxiety and wounded feelings;\n\nP10,000.00 for attorney's fees; and\n\nP5,000.00 for litigation expenses\nSO ORDERED. [8] The trial court ruled that the negligence of Gerosano, petitioner's driver, is the direct and proximate cause of the incident and of the injuries suffered by respondent Noe; that Gerosano's gross negligence and reckless imprudence had been confirmed by the Judgment in Criminal Case No. 463; that based on the findings of the police investigator, the faulty brakes caused the cargo truck to bump the Fiera; that the Traffic Accident Report showed that the tire mark of the cargo truck measuring 48 feet is visibly imprinted on the road where the incident took place indicating that the said vehicle was speeding fast; that the existence of one tire mark of the cargo truck proved that the said vehicle had a faulty brake, otherwise, it would have produced two tire marks on the road; and that the photographs taken right after the incident also showed who the guilty party was.\n\nThe trial court did not give credence to the argument of petitioner and his driver that the truck was properly checked by a mechanic before it was dispatched for a trip. It found that petitioner is negligent in maintaining his vehicle in good condition to prevent any accident to happen; that petitioner is liable under Article 2180 of the Civil Code as employer of driver Gerosano for being negligent in the selection and supervision of his driver as well as for maintaining and operating a vehicle that was not roadworthy; and that petitioner and his driver are solidarily liable for all the natural and probable consequences of their negligent acts or omissions. The trial court dismissed the third party complaint filed by petitioner and his driver against respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera.\n\nDissatisfied, only petitioner appealed to the CA. On April 17, 2000, the CA rendered the assailed decision which affirmed in toto the decision of the trial court. Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated August 16, 2000.\n\nHence, the herein petition for review.\n\nPetitioner submits the following issues for resolution: [9]\nWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT PETITIONER LARRY ESTACION EXERCISED THE DUE DILIGENCE OF A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY TO PREVENT DAMAGE DESPITE ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT;\n\nWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT PETITIONER LARRY ESTACION EXERCISED DUE DILIGENCE IN THE SELECTION AND SUPERVISION OF HIS EMPLOYEE AND IN MAINTAINING HIS CARGO TRUCK ROADWORTHY AND IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION;\n\nWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN EXONERATING RESPONDENTS CECILIA BANDOQUILLO AND GEMINIANO QUINQUILLERA.\nIn his Memorandum, petitioner contends that he was able to establish that he observed the diligence of a good father of a family not only in the selection of his employees but also in maintaining his truck roadworthy and in good operating condition; that the CA erred in exonerating respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera, owner and driver, respectively of the Fiera from liability when their negligence was the proximate cause of respondent Noe's injuries; that respondent Noe's act of standing in the rear carrier of the Fiera is in itself negligence on his part which was aggravated by the fact that respondent Quinquillera overtook the cargo truck driven by Gerosano on the curve and suddenly cut into the latter's lane; that due to the overloading of passengers, Gerosano was not able to see the brake lights of the Fiera when it suddenly stopped to pick up passengers; that overloading is in violation of the applicable traffic rules and regulations and Article 2185 is explicit when it provides that \"unless there is proof to the contrary, it is presumed that a person driving a motor vehicle has been negligent if at the time of the mishap, he was violating any traffic regulation\"; that since the Fiera driver was negligent, there arises a presumption that respondent Bandoquillo, as owner of the Fiera, is negligent in the selection and supervision of her employee; that assuming petitioner Estacion and his driver are not entirely blameless, the negligence of Quinquillera is sufficient basis why the respective liabilities should be delineated vis-\u00e1-vis their degree of negligence consistent with Article 2179 [10] of the Civil Code.\n\nRespondent Noe filed his Memorandum alleging that the first and second issues raised are factual in nature which are beyond the ambit of a petition for review; that petitioner failed to overcome the presumption of negligence thus he is liable for the negligence of his driver Gerosano; and that the third issue is best addressed to respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera.\n\nRespondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera failed to file their memorandum despite receipt of our Resolution requiring them to submit the same.\n\nWe find it apropos to resolve first the third issue considering that the extent of the liability of petitioner and his driver is dependent on whether respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera are the ones negligent in the vehicular mishap that happened in the afternoon of October 16, 1982 where respondent Noe was injured, resulting in the amputation of his left leg.\n\nAt the outset, the issue raised is factual in nature. Whether a person is negligent or not is a question of fact which we cannot pass upon in a petition for review on certiorari, as our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing errors of law. [11] As a rule, factual findings of the trial court, affirmed by the CA, are final and conclusive and may not be reviewed on appeal. The established exceptions are: (1) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (2) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (3) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (4) when the judgment of the CA is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the CA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (8) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; and (9) when the findings of fact of the CA are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record. [12]\n\nOn the basis of the records of this case, we find that there is cogent reason for us to review the factual findings of the lower courts to conform to the evidence on record and consider this case as an exception to the general rule.\n\nThe trial court and the appellate court had made a finding of fact that the proximate cause of the injury sustained by respondent Noe was the negligent and careless driving of petitioner's driver, Gerosano, who was driving at a fast speed with a faulty brake when the accident happened. We see no cogent reason to disturb the trial court's finding in giving more credence to the testimony of respondent Noe than the testimony of Gerosano, petitioner's truck driver.\n\nThe correctness of such finding is borne by the records. In his testimony, Gerosano said that he was driving the truck at a speed of about 40 kilometers per hour; [13] that the Fiera was behind him but upon reaching the curve, i.e. , after passing San Jose going to Dumaguete, the Fiera overtook him and blocked his way; [14] that he was 10 meters from the Fiera prior to the impact [15] when he applied the brakes [16] and tried to evade the Fiera but he still hit it. [17]\n\nWe agree with the trial court and the appellate court when they found that the truck was running at a fast speed because if Gerosano was really driving at a speed of 40 kilometers per hour and considering that the distance between the truck and the Fiera in front was about 10 meters, he had more than enough time to slacken his speed and apply his break to avoid hitting the Fiera. However, from the way the truck reacted to the application of the brakes, it showed that Gerosano was driving at a fast speed because the brakes skidded a lengthy 48 feet as shown in the sketch of police investigator Rubia of the tire marks visibly printed on the road.\n\nMoreover, the photographs taken after the incident and the testimony of Gerosano as to the extent of damage to the truck, i.e. the truck's windshield was broken and its hood was damaged after the impact, [18] further support the finding of both courts that Gerosano was driving at a fast pace.\n\nThe accident was further caused by the faulty brakes of the truck. Based on the sketch report, there was only one tire mark of the right tire of the cargo truck during the incident which, as testified to by police investigator Rubia, meant that the brakes of the truck were not aligned otherwise there would be two tire marks impressions on the road. [19] Although petitioner contends that there are other factors to explain why only one skid mark was found at the place of the incident, such as the angle and edges of the road as well as the balance of the weight of the cargo laden in the truck, he failed to show that indeed those factors were present to prove his defense. Such claim cannot be given credence considering that investigator Rubia testified that the body of the truck was very much on the road, i.e ., not over the shoulder of the road, [20] and the road was straight. [21] Indeed, it is the negligent act of petitioner's driver of driving the cargo truck at a fast speed coupled with faulty brakes which was the proximate cause of respondent Noe's injury.\n\nPetitioner's claim that right after overtaking the cargo truck, the Fiera driver suddenly stopped to pick up three passengers from the side of the road; that the overloading of passengers prevented his truck driver from determining that the Fiera had pulled over to pick up passengers as the latter's brakelights were obstructed by the passengers standing on the rear portion of the Fiera were not substantiated at all. Respondent Quinquillera, the driver of the Fiera, testified that the distance from the curve of the road when he stopped and picked up passengers was estimated to be about 80 to 90 feet. [22] In fact, from the sketch drawn by investigator Rubia, it showed a distance of 145 feet from the curve of the road to the speed tire mark (which measured about 48 feet) visibly printed on the road to the Fiera. This means that the Fiera driver did not stop immediately after the curve as what petitioner claims. Moreover, Gerosano admitted that his truck was at a distance of 10 meters prior to the impact. The distance between the two vehicles was such that it would be impossible for Gerosano not to have seen that the Fiera had pulled over to pick up passengers.\n\nHowever, we agree with petitioner that respondent Noe's act of standing on the rear carrier of the Fiera exposing himself to bodily injury is in itself negligence on his part. We find that the trial court and the CA erred when they failed to consider that respondent Noe was also guilty of contributory negligence. Contributory negligence is conduct on the part of the injured party, contributing as a legal cause to the harm he has suffered, which falls below the standard to which he is required to conform for his own protection. [23]\n\nIt has been established by the testimony of respondent Noe that he was with four or five other persons standing on the rear carrier of the Fiera since it was already full. Respondent Noe's act of standing on the left rear carrier portion of the Fiera showed his lack of ordinary care and foresight that such act could cause him harm or put his life in danger. It has been held that \"to hold a person as having contributed to his injuries, it must be shown that he performed an act that brought about his injuries in disregard of warning or signs of an impending danger to health and body. [24] Respondent Noes act of hanging on the Fiera is definitely dangerous to his life and limb.\n\nWe likewise find merit in petitioner's contention that respondent Quinquillera, the Fiera driver, was also negligent. There is merit to petitioner's claim that there was overloading which is in violation of traffic rules and regulations. Respondent Noe himself had testified that he was standing at the rear portion of the Fiera because the Fiera was already full. Respondent Quinquillera should not have taken more passengers than what the Fiera can accommodate. If the Fiera was not overloaded, respondent Noe would not have been standing on the rear carrier and sustained such extent of injury.\n\nFurthermore, we find that respondent Quinquillera was negligent in allowing respondent Noe to stand on the Fiera's rear portion. Section 32(c) of Article III of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as \"The Land Transportation and Traffic Code\" provides:\n(c) Riding on running boards - No driver shall allow any person to ride on running board, step board or mudguard of his motor vehicle for any purpose while the vehicle is in motion.\nRespondent Quinquillera's act of permitting respondent Noe to hang on the rear portion of the Fiera in such a dangerous position creates undue risk of harm to respondent Noe. Quinquillera failed to observe that degree of care, precaution and vigilance that the circumstances justly demand. Thus, respondent Noe suffered injury. [25] Since respondent Quinquillera is negligent, there arises a presumption of negligence on the part of his employer, respondent Bandoquillo, in supervising her employees properly. Such presumption was not rebutted at all by Bandoquillo. Thus, the CA erred in affirming the dismissal of the third party complaint filed by petitioner against respondents Quinquillera and Bandoquillo.\n\nPetitioner contends that he was able to establish that he exercised the due diligence of a good father of a family in the selection of his employees as well as in the maintenance of his cargo truck in good operating condition. He claims that in addition to looking at Gerosano's driver's license, he accompanied the latter in his first two trips, during which he ascertained Gerosano's competence as a driver, petitioner being a driver himself; that the truck driven by Gerosano has never figured in any accident prior to the incident involved; that upon his acquisition of the cargo truck on March 16, 1982, only 7 months prior to the incident, the same was thoroughly checked up and reconditioned; and that he had in his employ a mechanic who conducted periodic check-ups of the engine and brake system of the cargo truck.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nArticle 2180 of the Civil Code provides:\nArt. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.\n\nx x x\n\nEmployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.\n\nx x x\n\nThe responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage.\nAs the employer of Gerosano, petitioner is primarily and solidarily liable for the quasi-delict committed by the former. Petitioner is presumed to be negligent in the selection and supervision of his employee by operation of law and may be relieved of responsibility for the negligent acts of his driver, who at the time was acting within the scope of his assigned task, only if he can show that he observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage. [26]\n\nIn Yambao v. Zuniga , [27] we have clarified the meaning of the diligence of a good father of a family, thus:\nThe \"diligence of a good father\" referred to in the last paragraph of the aforecited statute means diligence in the selection and supervision of employees. Thus, when an employee, while performing his duties, causes damage to persons or property due to his own negligence, there arises the juris tantum presumption that the employer is negligent, either in the selection of the employee or in the supervision over him after the selection. For the employer to avoid the solidary liability for a tort committed by his employee, an employer must rebut the presumption by presenting adequate and convincing proof that in the selection and supervision of his employee, he or she exercises the care and diligence of a good father of a family. x x x\n\nPetitioner's claim that she exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of her driver, Venturina, deserves but scant consideration. Her allegation that before she hired Venturina she required him to submit his driver's license and clearances is worthless, in view of her failure to offer in evidence certified true copies of said license and clearances. Bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof under the rules of evidence. x x x\n\nIn any case, assuming arguendo that Venturina did submit his license and clearances when he applied with petitioner in January 1992, the latter still fails the test of due diligence in the selection of her bus driver. Case law teaches that for an employer to have exercised the diligence of a good father of a family, he should not be satisfied with the applicant's mere possession of a professional driver's license; he must also carefully examine the applicant for employment as to his qualifications, his experience and record of service. Petitioner failed to present convincing proof that she went to this extent of verifying Venturina's qualifications, safety record, and driving history. The presumption juris tantum that there was negligence in the selection of her bus driver, thus, remains unrebutted.\n\nNor did petitioner show that she exercised due supervision over Venturina after his selection. For as pointed out by the Court of Appeals, petitioner did not present any proof that she drafted and implemented training programs and guidelines on road safety for her employees. In fact, the record is bare of any showing that petitioner required Venturina to attend periodic seminars on road safety and traffic efficiency. Hence, petitioner cannot claim exemption from any liability arising from the recklessness or negligence of Venturina.\n\nIn sum, petitioner's liability to private respondents for the negligent and imprudent acts of her driver, Venturina, under Article 2180 of the Civil Code is both manifest and clear. Petitioner, having failed to rebut the legal presumption of negligence in the selection and supervision of her driver, is responsible for damages, the basis of the liability being the relationship of pater familias or on the employer's own negligence. x x x [28] (Emphasis supplied)\nPetitioner failed to show that he examined driver Gerosano as to his qualifications, experience and service records. In fact, the testimony of driver Gerosano in his cross-examination showed the non-observance of these requirements. Gerosano testified that petitioner was his first employer in Dumaguete and that he was accepted by petitioner on the very day he applied for the job; [29] that his driver's license was issued in Mindanao where he came from [30] and that while petitioner asked him about his driving record in Mindanao, he did not present any document of his driving record. [31] Such admission clearly established that petitioner did not exercise due diligence in the selection of his driver Gerosano.\n\nMoreover, the fact that petitioner's driver Gerosano was driving in an efficient manner when petitioner was with him in his first two trips would not conclusively establish that Gerosano was not at all reckless. It could not be considered as due diligence in the supervision of his driver to exempt petitioner from liability. In the supervision of his driver, petitioner must show that he had formulated training programs and guidelines on road safety for his driver which the records failed to show. We find that petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of negligence in the selection and supervision of his employees.\n\nMoreover, there was also no proof that he exercised diligence in maintaining his cargo truck roadworthy and in good operating condition. While petitioner's mechanic driver testified that he made a routine check up on October 15, 1982, one day before the mishap happened, and found the truck operational, there was no record of such inspection.\n\nTurning now to the award of damages, since there was contributory negligence on the part of respondent Noe, petitioner's liability should be mitigated in accordance with Article 2179 of the Civil Code which provides:\nWhen the plaintiff's own negligence was the immediate and proximate cause of his injury, he cannot recover damages. But if his negligence was only contributory, the immediate and proximate cause of the injury being the defendant's lack of due care, the plaintiff may recover damages, but the courts shall mitigate the damages to be awarded.\nThe underlying precept of the above article on contributory negligence is that a plaintiff who is partly responsible for his own injury should not be entitled to recover damages in full but must bear the consequences of his own negligence. The defendant must thus be held liable only for the damages actually caused by his negligence. [32]\n\nIn Phoenix Construction, Inc., v. Intermediate Appellate Court , [33] where we held that the legal and proximate cause of the accident and of Dionisio's injuries was the wrongful and negligent manner in which the dump truck was parked but found Dionisio guilty of contributory negligence on the night of the accident, we allocated most of the damages on a 20-80 ratio. In said case, we required Dionisio to bear 20% of the damages awarded by the appellate court, except as to the award of exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs.\n\nIn the present case, taking into account the contributing negligence of respondent Noe, we likewise rule that the demands of substantial justice are satisfied by distributing the damages also on a 20-80 ratio excluding attorney's fees and litigation expenses. [34] Consequently, 20% should be deducted from the actual and moral damages awarded by the trial court in favor of respondent Noe, that is: 20% of P129,584.20 for actual damages is P25,916.84 and 20% of P50,000.00 for moral damages is P10,000.00. Thus, after deducting the same, the award for actual damages should be P103,667.36 and P40,000.00 for moral damages or 80% of the damages so awarded.\n\nPetitioner and respondents Bandoquillo and Quinquillera are jointly and severally liable for the 80% of the damages as well as attorney's fees and litigation expenses conformably with our pronouncement in Tiu v. Arriesgado [35] where we held:\nThe petitioners, as well as the respondents Benjamin Condor and Sergio Pedrano are jointly and severally liable for said amount, conformably with the following pronouncement of the Court in Fabre, Jr. v. Court of Appeals :\n\nThe same rule of liability was applied in situations where the negligence of the driver of the bus on which plaintiff was riding concurred with the negligence of a third party who was the driver of another vehicle, thus causing an accident. In Anuran v. Bu\u00f1o, Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. v. Intermediate Appellate Court , and Metro Manila Transit Corporation v. Court of Appeals , the bus company, its driver, the operator of the other vehicle and the driver of the vehicle were jointly and severally held liable to the injured passenger or the latter's heirs. The basis of this allocation of liability was explained in Viluan v. Court of Appeals , thus:\n\"Nor should it make difference that the liability of petitioner [bus owner] springs from contract while that of respondents [owner and driver of other vehicle] arises from quasi delict . As early as 1913, we already ruled in Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, 56 Phil. 177, that in case of injury to a passenger due to the negligence of the driver of the bus on which he was riding and of the driver of another vehicle, the drivers as well as the owners of the two vehicles are jointly and severally liable for damages. Some members of the Court, though, are of the view that under the circumstances they are liable on quasi delict .\" [36]\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED . The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals dated April 17, 2000 as well as its Resolution dated August 16, 2000 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION to the effect that the dispositive portion of the Decision dated February 18, 1993 of the Regional Trial Court of Dumaguete City in Civil Case No. 8122, should read as follows:\n\"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering defendants Gerosano and Estacion, as well as third party defendants Bandoquillo and Quinquillera, to pay plaintiff, jointly and solidarily, the following:\nP103,667.36 for actual damages in the form of medical and hospitalization expenses;\n\nP40,000.00 for moral damages, consisting of mental anguish, moral shock, serious anxiety and wounded feelings;\n\nP10,000.00 for attorney's fees; and\n\nP5,000.00 for litigation expenses.\nSO ORDERED.\"\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairman) and Callejo, Sr., JJ. , concur.\nYnares-Santiago, J ., no part.\nChico-Nazario, J. , on leave.\n\n[1] Penned by Justice Renato C.

[4] (Emphasis supplied).\nThe case was docketed as Criminal Case No. L-4303.\n\nOn August 12, 1991, Ramon and Tommy were arraigned and pleaded not guilty in Criminal Case No. L-4302. [5] On the same day, Ramon, Tommy and Che-Che were also arraigned and pleaded not guilty in Criminal Case No. L-4303. [6] Accused Robert Tan remained at large. [7] Both cases were subsequently consolidated. Thereafter, trial ensued.\n\nThe prosecution's version of the facts of the two criminal cases is as follows: Around 7:00 p.m. of April 14, 1990, brothers Roque Ferrer (Roque) and Ricardo Ferrer (Ricardo) were on their way to the house of their father in Barangay Olo-Cafabrosan, Mangatarem, Pangasinan. [8] When they were near the house of their father, they heard someone shout the words, \" Dumating na ang mga mayabang. \" [9] They discovered that it was their cousin, Ramon, who uttered said words. [10] Ramon was in the yard fronting his father's house which is adjacent to the house of the father of Roque and Ricardo. [11] Ramon was then in the middle of a drinking spree with his brother Tommy, the latter's wife Che-Che and two other companions whom Roque and Ricardo did not recognize. [12] Upon hearing the words uttered by Ramon, Roque stopped and asked him who he was referring to. [13] In the meantime, Ricardo proceeded to the house of their father. [14] After asking Ramon and without getting a response from him, Roque followed Ricardo. [15] Upon reaching their father's house, Roque was met at the door by Ricardo and was told by the latter that he is going to ask Ramon why he made those remarks. [16] Roque proceeded to enter their father's house but later went out and followed his brother. [17] In the meantime, Ricardo was able to confront Ramon.\u00a0 However, Ramon did not answer when Ricardo asked him why he spoke words apparently referring to them as \" mayabang\" . [18] Since Ramon did not answer his question, Ricardo was about to go away when Roque approached them. [19] Without any warning, Ramon stabbed Roque with a kitchen knife hitting his stomach. [20] Ricardo immediately held Ramon's right arm to prevent him from further stabbing Roque. [21] At that instant, Tommy and Che-Che moved toward them. [22] Tommy suddenly stabbed Ricardo's back twice with an ice pick causing him to release his hold on Ramon's arm. [23] After stabbing Ricardo, Tommy proceeded to stab Roque twice on his \"right side\". [24] Che-Che then started hitting Roque's back with a bamboo pole. [25] Ramon, on the other hand, stabbed Ricardo twice on the right side of his waist. [26] After stabbing Ricardo, he resumed attacking Roque and again stabbed him twice on his chest. [27] When Ramon, Tommy and Che-Che noticed Roque to be bloody, they ran away. [28] It was then that Roque and Ricardo's sister-in-law, Leonila Ferrer (Leonila), summoned them to board the jeepney parked near their father's house in order for them to be brought to the hospital. [29] Roque proceeded to board the vehicle but when he was near the jeepney he was hit on the forehead by a drinking glass thrown by Robert Tan. [30] Roque was eventually able to get on the jeepney.\u00a0 Ricardo drove the vehicle. [31] They were able to reach their uncle's house half a kilometer away. [32] From there they were rushed to Mangatarem Hospital where first aid was administered to them. [33] They were then brought to Tarlac Provincial Hospital where they were further treated and confined for four days. [34] Thereafter, Ricardo was discharged from the hospital while Roque was transferred to the Chinese General Hospital where he stayed for another four days before being released. [35]\n\nOn the other hand, the following is the account of the defense:\u00a0 Between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. of April 14, 1990, Ramon and his brother Tommy, together with their wives Lucia and Che-Che, respectively, and a visitor, Tommy Gallano, were gathered in front of the house of Ramon and Tommy's father at Olo-Cafabrosan, Mangatarem, Pangasinan. [36] They were in the midst of merrymaking and were being entertained by Tommy's son who was dancing. [37] While watching his nephew dance, Ramon remarked, \" Ang yabang talaga ng aking pamangkin .\" [38] At that moment, it happened that brothers Roque and Ricardo were passing by. [39] They proceeded directly to their house. [40] A few minutes later, Roque went out of their house and went towards the group of Ramon and Tommy. [41] When Roque was approaching, Tommy stood up and asked him what the problem was. [42] Roque did not answer, and instead suddenly boxed Tommy on the face. [43] Tommy fell to the ground. [44] Thereupon, Roque proceeded to box him further. [45] Seeing his brother being mauled, Ramon approached Roque to pacify him. [46] However, Roque turned to Ramon and also boxed him on his face. [47] Ramon fought back.\u00a0 Thereafter, Ricardo arrived, armed with a jungle bolo. [48] Upon seeing that Ricardo was armed, Ramon, Tommy and Che-Che ran and went inside their father's house. [49] Their other companions followed suit.\u00a0 Tommy Gallano and Ricardo's wife closed the main door while Tommy proceeded to the back door to keep watch. [50] Meanwhile, Ricardo gave the jungle bolo to Roque who proceeded to follow Ramon and Tommy's group. [51] The entrance to the main door is through a stairs which is about five feet high. [52] Roque went up the stairs and, despite seeing the main door closed, insisted on entering the house. [53] By pushing, he was able to pry the door open and half of his body was able to enter the house. [54] At that moment, Ramon went to their kitchen, took a knife and stabbed Roque's stomach. [55] Despite being stabbed, Roque still insisted on getting inside the house.\u00a0 Ramon then went out of the house through the back door and proceeded to go to the main door where Roque was. [56] When he saw that Roque was still trying to force his way inside the house, he stabbed him, hitting his back. [57] When Ramon noticed Ricardo approaching, he also stabbed him. [58] After wounding Roque and Ricardo, Ramon went inside his father's house and closed the door. [59] Thereafter, they heard that Roque and Ricardo were brought to the hospital. [60] Fearing that they might be the victims of retaliation, Ramon and Tommy together with their other companions proceeded to the house of a certain Councilor Sabado and spent the night there. [61] The following morning, Tommy went to Manila. [62]\n\nAfter trial, the lower court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\nWHEREFORE IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, it is the Judgment of this Court:\n\nIn Criminal Case No. L-4302 for Frustrated Homicide, the Court finds the accused Ramon Ferrer and Tommy Ferrer GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Attempted Homicide without the attendance of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law hereby sentences each of the accused to suffer imprisonment [of] 6 months of arresto mayor as minimum to 2 years 4 months and 1 day of prision correccional as maximum;\n\nIn Criminal Case No. L-4303 for frustrated homicide, the Court finds the accused Ramon Ferrer and Tommy Ferrer GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide without the attendance of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law hereby sentences each of the accused to suffer imprisonment of 2 years 4 months and 1 day of prision correcciona l as minimum to 8 years and 1 day of prision mayor as maximum.\n\nThe said accused Ramon Ferrer and Tommy Ferrer are ordered to pay solidarily the following amounts:\nTo Roque Ferrer \u2013 The sum of P1,809.45 representing medical expenses; P11,979.60 representing unrealized earnings; P5,000.00 as expenses of litigation; and moral damages of P10,000.00 for a total of P28,789.05;\n\nTo Ricardo Ferrer \u2013 The sum of P2,000.00 as hospitalization and medical expenses; P10,000.00 as unrealized earnings; P5,000.00 as expenses in attending the hearings; and P8,000.00 as moral damages; for [a total of] P25,000.00 without subsidiary liability in case of insolvency and to pay the costs. With respect to the accused Cheche Ferrer, the Court finds her Not Guilty for lack of evidence.\n\nSO ORDERED. [63]\nAggrieved by the trial court's decision, Ramon and Tommy appealed to the CA.\n\nIn the presently assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC.\u00a0 The CA denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Ramon and Tommy. [64]\n\nHence, the present petition for review on certiorari filed by Tommy Ferrer (petitioner) only, raising the following issues:\nI\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS OVERLOOKED CERTAIN FACTS OF SUBSTANCE AND VALUE THAT, IF CONSIDERED, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE ACQUITTAL OF THE PETITIONER HEREIN.\n\nII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION CAN SUSTAIN THE CONVICTION OF THE PETITIONER HEREIN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. [65]\nAs in their appeal filed with the CA, the issues presented by petitioner in the instant petition boil down to the question of credibility of the witnesses.\u00a0 In both issues, petitioner contends that Ricardo and Roque's claim that he (petitioner) stabbed them should not be given credence because their testimonies are devoid of any factual basis.\u00a0 To support his contention, petitioner asserts that there are inconsistencies between the testimonies of Ricardo and Roque, on one hand, and the testimony of Dr.\u00a0 Ta\u00f1edo, the physician who treated their wounds, on the other.\u00a0 Petitioner cites the separate testimonies of Roque and Ricardo wherein they claimed that petitioner stabbed both of them; and that based on the testimony of Ricardo, petitioner used an ice pick in stabbing them.\u00a0 Petitioner alleges that the testimonies of Ricardo and Roque were directly contradicted by the testimony of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo when the latter testified that the injuries sustained by Ricardo and Roque were caused by a \"sharp instrument\" or \"sharp bladed instrument.\"\u00a0 Petitioner argues that an ice pick is neither a \"sharp instrument\" nor a \"sharp bladed instrument.\"\u00a0 Concluding that a wound caused by an ice pick is a puncture wound, he then cites Dr. Ta\u00f1edo's testimony that the latter did not see any puncture wounds when he treated Ricardo and Roque.\u00a0 In other words, petitioner makes much of the fact that none of the wounds of Ricardo and Roque were found by the examining physician as puncture wounds vis-\u00e0-vis Ricardo's testimony that petitioner used an ice pick in stabbing him.\u00a0 Petitioner also reasons out that the trial court did not give credence to the testimony of Roque Ferrer that he was hit on his right ear with a bamboo pole by Che-Che Ferrer; instead it (the trial court) relied on the testimony of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo that the injury on the right ear of Roque is a stab wound caused by a sharp instrument; consequently, it exonerated Che-Che for lack of evidence to prove her liability.\u00a0 Based on this premise, petitioner proceeds to argue that since Dr. Ta\u00f1edo testified that none of the injuries sustained by Ricardo and Roque is a puncture wound, the claims of the latter that petitioner stabbed them with an ice pick should not also be given credence and, thus, petitioner should also be acquitted.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nFirst, while Ricardo testified that the weapon used by petitioner is an ice pick, Roque did not claim that petitioner used an ice pick in stabbing him or his brother, Ricardo.\u00a0 In fact, Roque testified that he did not notice the weapon used by petitioner when the latter stabbed Ricardo. [66]\n\nSecond, Dr. Ta\u00f1edo testified that the injuries sustained by Ricardo and Roque were probably caused by a \"sharp instrument\", contrary to petitioner's claim that the wounds were caused by a \"sharp-bladed instrument.\"\u00a0 While Dr. Ta\u00f1edo admits that a knife could produce the kinds of wounds sustained by Ricardo and Roque there is nothing in the testimony of the doctor which discounts the possibility that said injuries could have also been caused by other weapons such as an ice pick. In fact, the testimony of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo is consistent with the definition cited by petitioner and his brother in their appeal brief filed with the CA, which, however, is omitted in their present petition, that \"an ice pick is a sharp , pointed kitchen or bar implement for cracking ice.\" [67] Moreover, Dr. Ta\u00f1edo did not testify nor did the defense present any evidence to prove that an ice pick could only cause a puncture wound.\n\nThird, we cannot give credit to petitioner's reliance on the case of People v. Mozar , [68] wherein this Court held that the nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased demolishes the credibility of the prosecution witness' story that he saw the other accused hack the deceased because it was found out later that the victim did not sustain any hack wound.\u00a0 In the present case, there is no dispute that Ricardo and Roque sustained multiple stab wounds.\u00a0 Together with prosecution witness Leonila, they unanimously identified Ramon and Tommy as their assailants.\n\nGranting that Ricardo erred in claiming that Tommy used an ice pick in stabbing him and Roque, it is a settled rule that witnesses are not expected to remember every single detail of an incident with perfect or total recall. [69] Even if the offended party may have erred in some aspects of his testimony, the same does not necessarily impair his testimony nor corrode his credibility. [70] Where a part of the testimony of a witness runs counter to the medical evidence submitted, it is within the sound discretion of the court to determine which portions of the testimony to reject as false and which to consider worthy of belief. [71] In the case of People v. Lucena , [72] we held that:\nModern trend in jurisprudence favors more flexibility when the testimony of a witness may be partly believed and partly disbelieved depending on the corroborative evidence presented at the trial.\u00a0 Thus, where the challenged testimony is sufficiently corroborated in its material points, or where the mistakes arise from innocent lapses and not from an apparent desire to pervert the truth, the rule may be relaxed. It is a rule that is neither absolute nor mandatory and binding upon the court, which may accept or reject portions of the witness' testimony based on its inherent credibility or on the corroborative evidence in the case. [73] (Emphasis supplied).\nIn the present case, Ricardo's testimony \u2013 that it was Tommy and Ramon who assaulted him and Roque and that they sustained various injuries by reason of such attack \u2013 is corroborated in its material points by the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses.\u00a0 Roque testified as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFISCAL ABELON\n | \nxxx | \n | \nQ | With whom was your brother talk (sic) in front of the house of Delfin Ferrer?\nA | Ramon Ferrer, maam.\n | \nQ | When you saw your brother Ricardo Ferrer and Ramon Ferrer talking, what did you do?\nA | I went near them, maam.\n | \nQ | What happened next when you went near them?\nA | Upon getting near them, Ramon Ferrer immediately stab (sic) me, maam or suddenly stabbed me.\n | \nQ | What part of your body was stabbed by Ramon Ferrer?\nA | I was first stabbed or hit in the stomach, maam.

The trial court gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.\u00a0 Verily, we reiterate the jurisprudential doctrine that great weight is accorded to the factual findings of the trial court particularly on the ascertainment of the credibility of witnesses; this can only be discarded or disturbed when it appears in the record that the trial court overlooked, ignored or disregarded some fact or circumstance of weight or significance which if considered would have altered the result. [76] In the present case, we find no cogent reason to depart from the findings of the trial court.\u00a0 Besides, Ricardo and Roque's testimonies as to the location and number of wounds they sustained by reason of petitioner and his brother's assault on them are materially consistent with the findings of the physician who examined and treated them.\n\nMoreover, there is nothing in the records to show that Ricardo, Roque and Leonila were ill-motivated in pointing the finger at petitioner and his brother, Ramon.\u00a0 In fact, in his testimony, Ricardo remained clueless as to why petitioner and his brother stabbed them considering that they never had any quarrel prior to the stabbing incident. [77] Roque also testified that he could not remember any instance where they quarreled with petitioner and his brother. [78] On the other hand, he claims that their relationship with one another is amiable. [79] It is not expected that a witness would prevaricate and aid in the criminal conviction of one who did not bring him any harm or injury. [80] Prosecution witness Leonila's relationship to the victims Ricardo and Roque as their sister-in-law would even render her testimony more credible because it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime to accuse somebody else other than the\u00a0real culprit. [81]\n\nFourth, we agree with the trial court that there is reasonable doubt as to the liability of Che-Che in view of the conflicting testimony of Roque that he was hit on the right ear by Che-Che with a bamboo pole and the finding of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo that the injury he found on the right ear of Roque was a stab wound caused by a sharp instrument.\u00a0 As testified upon by Dr. Ta\u00f1edo, the injuries that can be produced when a person is repeatedly hit with a blunt instrument such as a piece of wood are contusions. [82] Since a bamboo pole is a blunt instrument, it is expected that the injuries that can be sustained when one is beaten by this object are contusions.\u00a0 The wound on the right ear of Roque was found to be a stab wound caused by a sharp instrument.\u00a0 In short, the nature of the wound found on the right ear of Roque is not consistent with the kind of weapon alleged to have been used by Che-Che in inflicting said wound.\u00a0 However, we cannot use the same line of reasoning to exonerate petitioner. Dr. Ta\u00f1edo testified that all the injuries sustained by Roque and Ricardo were stab wounds caused by a sharp instrument.\u00a0 This finding is not negated by Ricardo's testimony that the weapon used by petitioner in stabbing him was an ice pick.\u00a0 Rather, this finding is consistent with the positive statements of Roque and Leonila that petitioner stabbed Ricardo and Roque.\u00a0 In other words, insofar as the criminal liability of petitioner is concerned, we find nothing inconsistent between the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, on one hand, and the medical findings of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo, on the other.\n\nAgainst the positive identification of Ricardo, Roque and Leonila, all that petitioner could interpose as defense is denial, which, under settled jurisprudence, could not prevail over the positive testimony of witnesses. [83] Denial is intrinsically a weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility. [84] To be sure, it is negative, self-serving evidence that cannot be given evidentiary weight greater than that of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters. [85] Time-tested is the rule that between the positive assertions of prosecution witnesses and the negative averments of the accused, the former indisputably deserve more credence and evidentiary weight. [86]\n\nPetitioner insists that his defense does not consist of bare denial.\u00a0 He claims that his testimony is corroborated by the testimonies of prosecution witness Dr. Ta\u00f1edo and of his (petitioner's) brother, Ramon.\n\nWe do not agree.\n\nThe testimony of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo does not corroborate petitioner's defense of denial because, as we have earlier discussed, it does not disregard the possibility that the stab wounds sustained by Ricardo and Roque were caused by an ice pick.\u00a0 There is nothing in the testimony of Dr. Ta\u00f1edo that an ice pick can only produce a puncture wound.\u00a0 It is only petitioner's assumption and conclusion that an ice pick can only cause a puncture wound.\n\nRamon attempted to corroborate petitioner's denial by testifying that he (Ramon) alone stabbed Ricardo and Roque and that he inflicted two wounds on Roque and only one wound on Ricardo. [87] However, the same does not inspire belief.\u00a0 The physical evidence does not support Ramon's testimony because the medical certificates issued by Dr. Ta\u00f1edo showed that Roque sustained six stab wounds [88] while Ricardo had four stab wounds. [89] It follows that someone else must have inflicted the other wounds of Roque and Ricardo.\u00a0 Based on the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Roque, Ricardo and Leonila, both petitioner and Ramon stabbed Roque and Ricardo.\u00a0 The physical evidence taken together with the testimonies of Ramon, Roque, Ricardo and Leonila point to the inevitable conclusion that petitioner inflicted stab wounds on Roque and Ricardo.\n\nIn other words, the prosecution sufficiently established the fact that petitioner was seen stabbing Ricardo and Roque with a weapon and that they sustained stab wounds by reason of such attack.\n\nMoreover, as to the location of the wounds, it must be noted that most of the stab wounds sustained by Roque (on the right and left sides of his chest and on the right side of his abdomen) and Ricardo (on the left side of the abdomen and on the left and right lower back) are located either at the thoracic or abdominal areas, which are delicate portions of the body.\u00a0 It is in these areas that vital organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, gall bladder, spleen, and pancreas are located. [90] A penetrating wound in any of these spots may cause grave injuries that can lead to death. [91]\n\nIn the case of Ricardo, while Dr. Ta\u00f1edo testified that the wounds sustained by the former are classified as minor injuries and that these wounds would not normally cause death, he also declared that it is possible that complications which could be fatal would have arisen if no medical intervention was made. [92] The nature of the weapons used as well as the nature and location of the wounds inflicted upon Ricardo and Roque undoubtedly established petitioner's and Ramon's intent to kill the victims.\u00a0 Thus, the CA did not err in finding petitioner and Ramon guilty of Attempted Homicide in Criminal Case No. L-4302 and Frustrated Homicide in Criminal Case No. L-4303.\n\nIt is a well-settled rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case wide open for review and that it becomes the duty of the Court to correct such errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from, whether they are assigned as errors or not. [93]\n\nBased on the evidence adduced, we find that the lower courts erred in awarding some of the damages in favor of the victims, insofar as herein petitioner is concerned.\n\nFirst, we find the award of P10,000.00 in favor of Roque and P10,000.00 in favor of Ricardo, as compensation for unrealized earnings, improper for lack of evidence to prove the same.\u00a0\u00a0 Compensation\u00a0 for\u00a0 lost income is in the nature of damages and\u00a0 requires\u00a0 due\u00a0 proof\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 damage\u00a0 suffered. [94] In the present case, aside from the self-serving testimony of Ricardo, the prosecution failed to present any other proof to substantiate his claim of lost earnings.\n\nSecond, the award of P2,000.00 in favor of Ricardo, representing hospitalization and medical expenses is likewise improper for lack of proof to substantiate the same.\u00a0 As correctly held by the trial court, Ricardo failed to present receipts of payment when he claimed the amount of P2,000.00 as his expenses for hospitalization. [95] On the other hand, Roque was able to present receipts to prove his medical expenses.\n\nThird, the award of P8,000.00 as moral damages in favor of Ricardo is also unsubstantiated and, therefore, should be deleted, as he did not testify on any emotional distress, mental anguish or even physical suffering which he suffered as a result of the crime.\u00a0 While no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary, it is essential that the claimant should satisfactorily provide factual basis for the alleged moral injury. [96] Nonetheless, we find the award of moral damages in favor of Roque to be in order since he testified that he suffered pain even at the time that he was being discharged from the hospital. [97]\n\nFourth, we find the award of P5,000.00, as \"expenses of litigation\" and \"expenses in attending the hearings\" in favor of Roque and Ricardo, respectively, to be without basis.\u00a0 Article 2208 of the Civil Code provides, among others, that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, may be recovered in cases where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.\u00a0 However, considering that the grant of attorney's fees and litigation expenses under this provision of law is in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, it is necessary for the court to make findings of fact and law and give good reasons in granting such an award.\u00a0 Thus, in People v. Colonia , [98] we disallowed the award of litigation expenses and ruled as follows:\nRegarding the attorney's fees and litigation expenses, Article 2208 of the New Civil Code enumerates the instances where such may be awarded and, in any event, it must be reasonable, just and equitable.\u00a0 Attorney's fees as part of damages are not meant to enrich the winning party at the expense of the losing litigant.\u00a0 They are not awarded every time a party prevails in a suit because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.\u00a0 The award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the rule.\u00a0 As such, it is necessary for the court to make findings of fact and law that would bring the case within the exception and justify the grant of such award.\u00a0 Aside from the dispositive portion, nothing was ever said by the trial court in the body of the decision to justify the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses.\u00a0 Hence, we disallow them. [99]\nIn the instant case, a perusal of the trial court's decision shows that the trial court did not make any findings or discussions to justify the award of litigation expenses.\u00a0 Moreover, a review of the records indicates that while Roque testified that he and his brother spent money in attending the hearings before the trial court, [100] no documentary evidence was presented to prove the actual expenses that they incurred.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 18293 is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION that the award of P11,979.60 for unrealized earnings and P5,000.00 as expenses of litigation in favor of Roque Ferrer; and the award of P10,000.00 for unrealized earnings, P2,000.00 for hospitalization and medical expenses, P5,000.00 as expenses in attending hearings, and P8,000.00 for moral damages, in favor of Ricardo Ferrer, are DELETED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson) Ynares-Santiago, Callejo, Sr ., and Chico-Nazario, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez (now Associate Justice of this Court) and concurred in by Justices Salvador J.

      "title": "ANITA CHENG, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES WILLIAM SY AND TESSIE SY, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N NACHURA, J.: This is a petition[1] for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of the Order dated January 2, 2006[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 18, Manila in Civil Case No. 05-112452 entitled Anita Cheng v. Spouses William Sy and Tessie Sy.The antecedents are as follows--Petitioner Anita Cheng filed two (2) estafa cases before the RTC, Branch 7, Manila against respondent spouses William and Tessie Sy (Criminal Case No. 98-969952 against Tessie Sy and Criminal Case No. 98-969953 against William Sy) for issuing to her Philippine Bank of Commerce (PBC) Check Nos. 171762 and 71860 for P300,000.00 each, in payment of their loan, both of which were dishonored upon presentment for having been drawn against a closed account.Meanwhile, based on the same facts, petitioner, on January 20, 1999, filed against respondents two (2) cases for violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang (BP Blg.) 22 before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 25, Manila (Criminal Case Nos. 341458-59).On March 16, 2004, the RTC, Branch 7, Manila dismissed the estafa cases for failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of the crime. The Order dismissing Criminal Case No. 98-969952 contained no declaration as to the civil liability of Tessie Sy.[3] On the other hand, the Order in Criminal Case No. 98-969953 contained a statement, \"Hence, if there is any liability of the accused, the same is purely `civil,' not criminal in nature.\"[4]Later, the MeTC, Branch 25, Manila, dismissed, on demurrer, the BP Blg. 22 cases in its Order[5] dated February 7, 2005 on account of the failure of petitioner to identify the accused respondents in open court. The Order also did not make any pronouncement as to the civil liability of accused respondents.On April 26, 2005, petitioner lodged against respondents before the RTC, Branch 18, Manila, a complaint[6] for collection of a sum of money with damages (Civil Case No. 05-112452) based on the same loaned amount of P600,000.00 covered by the two PBC checks previously subject of the estafa and BP Blg. 22 cases.In the assailed Order[7] dated January 2, 2006, the RTC, Branch 18, Manila, dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ratiocinating that the civil action to collect the amount of P600,000.00 with damages was already impliedly instituted in the BP Blg. 22 cases in light of Section 1, paragraph (b) of Rule 111 of the Revised Rules of Court.Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration[8] which the court denied in its Order[9] dated June 5, 2006. Hence, this petition, raising the sole legal issue -Whether or not Section 1 of Rule 111 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure and Supreme Court Circular No. 57-97 on the Rules and Guidelines in the filing and prosecution of criminal cases under BP Blg. 22 are applicable to the present case where the nature of the order dismissing the cases for bouncing checks against the respondents was [based] on the failure of the prosecution to identify both the accused (respondents herein)?[10]Essentially, petitioner argues that since the BP Blg. 22 cases were filed on January 20, 1999, the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure promulgated on December 1, 2000 should not apply, as it must be given only prospective application. She further contends that that her case falls within the following exceptions to the rule that the civil action correspondent to the criminal action is deemed instituted with the latter--(1) additional evidence as to the identities of the accused is necessary for the resolution of the civil aspect of the case;(2) a separate complaint would be just as efficacious as or even more expedient than a timely remand to the trial court where the criminal action was decided for further hearings on the civil aspect of the case;(3) the trial court failed to make any pronouncement as to the civil liability of the accused amounting to a reservation of the right to have the civil liability litigated in a separate action;(4) the trial court did not declare that the facts from which the civil liability might arise did not exist;(5) the civil complaint is based on an obligation ex-contractu and not ex-delicto pursuant to Article 31[11] of the Civil Code; and(6) the claim for civil liability for damages may be had under Article 29[12] of the Civil Code.Petitioner also points out that she was not assisted by any private prosecutor in the BP Blg. 22 proceedings.The rule is that upon the filing of the estafa and BP Blg. 22 cases against respondents, where the petitioner has not made any waiver, express reservation to litigate separately, or has not instituted the corresponding civil action to collect the amount of P600,000.00 and damages prior to the criminal action, the civil action is deemed instituted with the criminal cases.[13]This rule applies especially with the advent of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. Thus, during the pendency of both the estafa and the BP Blg. 22 cases, the action to recover the civil liability was impliedly instituted and remained pending before the respective trial courts. This is consonant with our ruling in Rodriguez v. Ponferrada[14] that the possible single civil liability arising from the act of issuing a bouncing check can be the subject of both civil actions deemed instituted with the estafa case and the prosecution for violation of BP Blg. 22, simultaneously available to the complaining party, without traversing the prohibition against forum shopping.[15] Prior to the judgment in either the estafa case or the BP Blg. 22 case, petitioner, as the complainant, cannot be deemed to have elected either of the civil actions both impliedly instituted in the said criminal proceedings to the exclusion of the other.[16]The dismissal of the estafa cases for failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt--where in Criminal Case No. 98-969952 there was no pronouncement as regards the civil liability of the accused and in Criminal Case No. 98-969953 where the trial court declared that the liability of the accused was only civil in nature--produced the legal effect of a reservation by the petitioner of her right to litigate separately the civil action impliedly instituted with the estafa cases, following Article 29 of the Civil Code.[17]However, although this civil action could have been litigated separately on account of the dismissal of the estafa cases on reasonable doubt, the petitioner was deemed to have also elected that such civil action be prosecuted together with the BP Blg. 22 cases in light of the Rodriguez v. Ponferrada ruling.With the dismissal of the BP Blg. 22 cases for failure to establish the identity of the accused, the question that arises is whether such dismissal would have the same legal effect as the dismissed estafa cases. Put differently, may petitioner's action to recover respondents' civil liability be also allowed to prosper separately after the BP Blg. 22 cases were dismissed?Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure states -Section 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions. -x x x(b) The criminal action for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil action. No reservation to file such civil action separately shall be allowed.Upon filing of the joint criminal and civil actions, the offended party shall pay in full the filing fees based on the amount of the check involved, which shall be considered as the actual damages claimed. Where the complaint or information also seeks to recover liquidated, moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary damages, the offended party shall pay the filing fees based on the amounts alleged therein. If the amounts are not so alleged but any of these damages [is] subsequently awarded by the court, the filing fees based on the amount awarded shall constitute a first lien on the judgment.Where the civil action has been filed separately and trial thereof has not yet commenced, it may be consolidated with the criminal action upon application with the court trying the latter case. If the application is granted, the trial of both actions shall proceed in accordance with section 2 of this Rule governing consolidation of the civil and criminal actions.Petitioner is in error when she insists that the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure should not apply because she filed her BP Blg. 22 complaints in 1999. It is now settled that rules of procedure apply even to cases already pending at the time of their promulgation. The fact that procedural statutes may somehow affect the litigants' rights does not preclude their retroactive application to pending actions. It is axiomatic that the retroactive application of procedural laws does not violate any right of a person who may feel that he is adversely affected, nor is it constitutionally objectionable. The reason for this is that, as a general rule, no vested right may attach to, nor arise from, procedural laws.[18]Indeed, under the present revised Rules, the criminal action for violation of BP Blg. 22 includes the corresponding civil action to recover the amount of the checks. It should be stressed, this policy is intended to discourage the separate filing of the civil action. In fact, the Rules even prohibits the reservation of a separate civil action, i.e., one can no longer file a separate civil case after the criminal complaint is filed in court. The only instance when separate proceedings are allowed is when the civil action is filed ahead of the criminal case. Even then, the Rules encourages the consolidation of the civil and criminal cases. Thus, where petitioner's rights may be fully adjudicated in the proceedings before the court trying the BP Blg. 22 cases, resort to a separate action to recover civil liability is clearly unwarranted on account of res judicata, for failure of petitioner to appeal the civil aspect of the cases. In view of this special rule governing actions for violation of BP Blg. 22, Article 31 of the Civil Code is not applicable.[19]Be it remembered that rules governing procedure before the courts, while not cast in stone, are for the speedy, efficient, and orderly dispensation of justice and should therefore be adhered to in order to attain this objective.[20]However, in applying the procedure discussed above, it appears that petitioner would be left without a remedy to recover from respondents the P600,000.00 allegedly loaned from her. This could prejudice even the petitioner's Notice of Claim involving the same amount filed in Special Proceedings No. 98-88390 (Petition for Voluntary Insolvency by Kolin Enterprises, William Sy and Tessie Sy), which case was reportedly archived for failure to prosecute the petition for an unreasonable length of time.[21] Expectedly, respondents would raise the same defense that petitioner had already elected to litigate the civil action to recover the amount of the checks along with the BP Blg. 22 cases.It is in this light that we find petitioner's contention that she was not assisted by a private prosecutor during the BP Blg. 22 proceedings critical. Petitioner indirectly protests that the public prosecutor failed to protect and prosecute her cause when he failed to have her establish the identities of the accused during the trial and when he failed to appeal the civil action deemed impliedly instituted with the BP Blg. 22 cases. On this ground, we agree with petitioner.Faced with the dismissal of the BP Blg. 22 cases, petitioner's recourse pursuant to the prevailing rules of procedure would have been to appeal the civil action to recover the amount loaned to respondents corresponding to the bounced checks. Hence, the said civil action may proceed requiring only a preponderance of evidence on the part of petitioner. Her failure to appeal within the reglementary period was tantamount to a waiver altogether of the remedy to recover the civil liability of respondents. However, due to the gross mistake of the prosecutor in the BP Blg. 22 cases, we are constrained to digress from this rule.It is true that clients are bound by the mistakes, negligence and omission of their counsel.[22] But this rule admits of exceptions - (1) where the counsel's mistake is so great and serious that the client is prejudiced and denied his day in court, or (2) where the counsel is guilty of gross negligence resulting in the client's deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law.[23] Tested against these guidelines, we hold that petitioner's lot falls within the exceptions.It is an oft-repeated exhortation to counsels to be well-informed of existing laws and rules and to keep abreast with legal developments, recent enactments and jurisprudence. Unless they faithfully comply with such duty, they may not be able to discharge competently and diligently their obligations as members of the Bar.[24] Further, lawyers in the government service are expected to be more conscientious in the performance of their duties as they are subject to public scrutiny. They are not only members of the Bar but are also public servants who owe utmost fidelity to public service.[25] Apparently, the public prosecutor neglected to equip himself with the knowledge of the proper procedure for BP Blg. 22 cases under the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure such that he failed to appeal the civil action impliedly instituted with the BP Blg. 22 cases, the only remaining remedy available to petitioner to be able to recover the money she loaned to respondents, upon the dismissal of the criminal cases on demurrer. By this failure, petitioner was denied her day in court to prosecute the respondents for their obligation to pay their loan.Moreover, we take into consideration the trial court's observation when it dismissed the estafa charge in Criminal Case No. 98-969953 that if there was any liability on the part of respondents, it was civil in nature. Hence, if the loan be proven true, the inability of petitioner to recover the loaned amount would be tantamount to unjust enrichment of respondents, as they may now conveniently evade payment of their obligation merely on account of a technicality applied against petitioner.There is unjust enrichment when (1) a person is unjustly benefited, and (2) such benefit is derived at the expense of or with damages to another. This doctrine simply means that a person shall not be allowed to profit or enrich himself inequitably at another's expense. One condition for invoking this principle of unjust enrichment is that the aggrieved party has no other recourse based on contract, quasi-contract, crime, quasi-delict or any other provision of law.[26]Court litigations are primarily designed to search for the truth, and a liberal interpretation and application of the rules which will give the parties the fullest opportunity to adduce proof is the best way to ferret out the truth. The dispensation of justice and vindication of legitimate grievances should not be barred by technicalities.[27] For reasons of substantial justice and equity, as the complement of the legal jurisdiction that seeks to dispense justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and want of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, are incompetent to do so,[28] we thus rule, pro hac vice, in favor of petitioner.WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.

When the accused in a criminal prosecution is acquitted on the ground that his guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, a civil action for damages for the same act or omission may be instituted. Such action requires only a preponderance of evidence. Upon motion of the defendant, the court may require the plaintiff to file a bond to answer for damages in case the complaint should be found to be malicious.[13] Section 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions. - When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability is impliedly instituted with the criminal action, unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves his right to institute it separately, or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.Such civil action includes recovery of indemnity under the Revised Penal Code, and damages under Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil Code of the Philippines arising from the same act or omission of the accused.A waiver of any of the civil actions extinguishes the others. The institution of, or the reservation of the right to file, any of said civil actions separately waives the others.The reservation of the right to institute the separate civil actions shall be made before the prosecution starts to present its evidence and under circumstances affording the offended party a reasonable opportunity to make such reservation.In no case may the offended party recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the accused.When the offended party seeks to enforce civil liability against the accused by way of moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary damages, the filing fees for such civil action as provided in these Rules shall constitute a first lien on the judgment except in an award for actual damages.In cases wherein the amount of damages, other than actual, is alleged in the complaint or information, the corresponding filing fees shall be paid by the offended party upon the filing thereof in court for trial.

SPOUSES WILLIAM SY AND TESSIE SY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nNACHURA, J.:\n\nThis is a petition [1] for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of the Order dated January 2, 2006 [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 18, Manila in Civil Case No. 05-112452 entitled Anita Cheng v. Spouses William Sy and Tessie Sy .\n\nThe antecedents are as follows--\n\nPetitioner Anita Cheng filed two (2) estafa cases before the RTC, Branch 7, Manila against respondent spouses William and Tessie Sy (Criminal Case No. 98-969952 against Tessie Sy and Criminal Case No. 98-969953 against William Sy) for issuing to her Philippine Bank of Commerce (PBC) Check Nos. 171762 and 71860 for P300,000.00 each, in payment of their loan, both of which were dishonored upon presentment for having been drawn against a closed account.\n\nMeanwhile, based on the same facts, petitioner, on January 20, 1999, filed against respondents two (2) cases for violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang (BP Blg.) 22 before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 25, Manila (Criminal Case Nos. 341458-59).\n\nOn March 16, 2004, the RTC, Branch 7, Manila dismissed the estafa cases for failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of the crime. The Order dismissing Criminal Case No. 98-969952 contained no declaration as to the civil liability of Tessie Sy. [3] On the other hand, the Order in Criminal Case No. 98-969953 contained a statement, \"Hence, if there is any liability of the accused, the same is purely `civil,' not criminal in nature.\" [4]\n\nLater, the MeTC, Branch 25, Manila, dismissed, on demurrer, the BP Blg. 22 cases in its Order [5] dated February 7, 2005 on account of the failure of petitioner to identify the accused respondents in open court. The Order also did not make any pronouncement as to the civil liability of accused respondents.\n\nOn April 26, 2005, petitioner lodged against respondents before the RTC, Branch 18, Manila, a complaint [6] for collection of a sum of money with damages (Civil Case No. 05-112452) based on the same loaned amount of P600,000.00 covered by the two PBC checks previously subject of the estafa and BP Blg. 22 cases.\n\nIn the assailed Order [7] dated January 2, 2006, the RTC, Branch 18, Manila, dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ratiocinating that the civil action to collect the amount of P600,000.00 with damages was already impliedly instituted in the BP Blg. 22 cases in light of Section 1, paragraph (b) of Rule 111 of the Revised Rules of Court.\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration [8] which the court denied in its Order [9] dated June 5, 2006. Hence, this petition, raising the sole legal issue -\nWhether or not Section 1 of Rule 111 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure and Supreme Court Circular No. 57-97 on the Rules and Guidelines in the filing and prosecution of criminal cases under BP Blg. 22 are applicable to the present case where the nature of the order dismissing the cases for bouncing checks against the respondents was [based] on the failure of the prosecution to identify both the accused (respondents herein)? [10]\nEssentially, petitioner argues that since the BP Blg. 22 cases were filed on January 20, 1999, the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure promulgated on December 1, 2000 should not apply, as it must be given only prospective application. She further contends that that her case falls within the following exceptions to the rule that the civil action correspondent to the criminal action is deemed instituted with the latter--\n(1) additional evidence as to the identities of the accused is necessary for the resolution of the civil aspect of the case;\n\n(2) a separate complaint would be just as efficacious as or even more expedient than a timely remand to the trial court where the criminal action was decided for further hearings on the civil aspect of the case;\n\n(3) the trial court failed to make any pronouncement as to the civil liability of the accused amounting to a reservation of the right to have the civil liability litigated in a separate action;\n\n(4) the trial court did not declare that the facts from which the civil liability might arise did not exist;\n\n(5) the civil complaint is based on an obligation ex-contractu and not ex-delicto pursuant to Article 31 [11] of the Civil Code; and\n\n(6) the claim for civil liability for damages may be had under Article 29 [12] of the Civil Code.\nPetitioner also points out that she was not assisted by any private prosecutor in the BP Blg. 22 proceedings.\n\nThe rule is that upon the filing of the estafa and BP Blg. 22 cases against respondents, where the petitioner has not made any waiver, express reservation to litigate separately, or has not instituted the corresponding civil action to collect the amount of P600,000.00 and damages prior to the criminal action, the civil action is deemed instituted with the criminal cases. [13]\n\nThis rule applies especially with the advent of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. Thus, during the pendency of both the estafa and the BP Blg. 22 cases, the action to recover the civil liability was impliedly instituted and remained pending before the respective trial courts. This is consonant with our ruling in Rodriguez v. Ponferrada [14] that the possible single civil liability arising from the act of issuing a bouncing check can be the subject of both civil actions deemed instituted with the estafa case and the prosecution for violation of BP Blg. 22, simultaneously available to the complaining party, without traversing the prohibition against forum shopping. [15] Prior to the judgment in either the estafa case or the BP Blg. 22 case, petitioner, as the complainant, cannot be deemed to have elected either of the civil actions both impliedly instituted in the said criminal proceedings to the exclusion of the other. [16]\n\nThe dismissal of the estafa cases for failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt--where in Criminal Case No. 98-969952 there was no pronouncement as regards the civil liability of the accused and in Criminal Case No. 98-969953 where the trial court declared that the liability of the accused was only civil in nature--produced the legal effect of a reservation by the petitioner of her right to litigate separately the civil action impliedly instituted with the estafa cases, following Article 29 of the Civil Code. [17]\n\nHowever, although this civil action could have been litigated separately on account of the dismissal of the estafa cases on reasonable doubt, the petitioner was deemed to have also elected that such civil action be prosecuted together with the BP Blg. 22 cases in light of the Rodriguez v. Ponferrada ruling.\n\nWith the dismissal of the BP Blg. 22 cases for failure to establish the identity of the accused, the question that arises is whether such dismissal would have the same legal effect as the dismissed estafa cases. Put differently, may petitioner's action to recover respondents' civil liability be also allowed to prosper separately after the BP Blg. 22 cases were dismissed?\n\nSection 1 (b), Rule 111 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure states -\nSection 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions. -\n\nx x x\n\n(b) The criminal action for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil action. No reservation to file such civil action separately shall be allowed.\n\nUpon filing of the joint criminal and civil actions, the offended party shall pay in full the filing fees based on the amount of the check involved, which shall be considered as the actual damages claimed. Where the complaint or information also seeks to recover liquidated, moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary damages, the offended party shall pay the filing fees based on the amounts alleged therein. If the amounts are not so alleged but any of these damages [is] subsequently awarded by the court, the filing fees based on the amount awarded shall constitute a first lien on the judgment.\n\nWhere the civil action has been filed separately and trial thereof has not yet commenced, it may be consolidated with the criminal action upon application with the court trying the latter case. If the application is granted, the trial of both actions shall proceed in accordance with section 2 of this Rule governing consolidation of the civil and criminal actions.\nPetitioner is in error when she insists that the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure should not apply because she filed her BP Blg. 22 complaints in 1999. It is now settled that rules of procedure apply even to cases already pending at the time of their promulgation. The fact that procedural statutes may somehow affect the litigants' rights does not preclude their retroactive application to pending actions. It is axiomatic that the retroactive application of procedural laws does not violate any right of a person who may feel that he is adversely affected, nor is it constitutionally objectionable. The reason for this is that, as a general rule, no vested right may attach to, nor arise from, procedural laws. [18]\n\nIndeed, under the present revised Rules, the criminal action for violation of BP Blg. 22 includes the corresponding civil action to recover the amount of the checks. It should be stressed, this policy is intended to discourage the separate filing of the civil action. In fact, the Rules even prohibits the reservation of a separate civil action, i.e. , one can no longer file a separate civil case after the criminal complaint is filed in court. The only instance when separate proceedings are allowed is when the civil action is filed ahead of the criminal case. Even then, the Rules encourages the consolidation of the civil and criminal cases. Thus, where petitioner's rights may be fully adjudicated in the proceedings before the court trying the BP Blg. 22 cases, resort to a separate action to recover civil liability is clearly unwarranted on account of res judicata, for failure of petitioner to appeal the civil aspect of the cases. In view of this special rule governing actions for violation of BP Blg. 22, Article 31 of the Civil Code is not applicable. [19]\n\nBe it remembered that rules governing procedure before the courts, while not cast in stone, are for the speedy, efficient, and orderly dispensation of justice and should therefore be adhered to in order to attain this objective. [20]\n\nHowever, in applying the procedure discussed above, it appears that petitioner would be left without a remedy to recover from respondents the P600,000.00 allegedly loaned from her. This could prejudice even the petitioner's Notice of Claim involving the same amount filed in Special Proceedings No. 98-88390 ( Petition for Voluntary Insolvency by Kolin Enterprises, William Sy and Tessie Sy ), which case was reportedly archived for failure to prosecute the petition for an unreasonable length of time. [21] Expectedly, respondents would raise the same defense that petitioner had already elected to litigate the civil action to recover the amount of the checks along with the BP Blg. 22 cases.\n\nIt is in this light that we find petitioner's contention that she was not assisted by a private prosecutor during the BP Blg. 22 proceedings critical. Petitioner indirectly protests that the public prosecutor failed to protect and prosecute her cause when he failed to have her establish the identities of the accused during the trial and when he failed to appeal the civil action deemed impliedly instituted with the BP Blg. 22 cases. On this ground, we agree with petitioner.\n\nFaced with the dismissal of the BP Blg. 22 cases, petitioner's recourse pursuant to the prevailing rules of procedure would have been to appeal the civil action to recover the amount loaned to respondents corresponding to the bounced checks. Hence, the said civil action may proceed requiring only a preponderance of evidence on the part of petitioner. Her failure to appeal within the reglementary period was tantamount to a waiver altogether of the remedy to recover the civil liability of respondents. However, due to the gross mistake of the prosecutor in the BP Blg. 22 cases, we are constrained to digress from this rule.\n\nIt is true that clients are bound by the mistakes, negligence and omission of their counsel. [22] But this rule admits of exceptions - (1) where the counsel's mistake is so great and serious that the client is prejudiced and denied his day in court, or (2) where the counsel is guilty of gross negligence resulting in the client's deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law. [23] Tested against these guidelines, we hold that petitioner's lot falls within the exceptions.\n\nIt is an oft-repeated exhortation to counsels to be well-informed of existing laws and rules and to keep abreast with legal developments, recent enactments and jurisprudence. Unless they faithfully comply with such duty, they may not be able to discharge competently and diligently their obligations as members of the Bar. [24] Further, lawyers in the government service are expected to be more conscientious in the performance of their duties as they are subject to public scrutiny. They are not only members of the Bar but are also public servants who owe utmost fidelity to public service. [25] Apparently, the public prosecutor neglected to equip himself with the knowledge of the proper procedure for BP Blg. 22 cases under the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure such that he failed to appeal the civil action impliedly instituted with the BP Blg. 22 cases, the only remaining remedy available to petitioner to be able to recover the money she loaned to respondents, upon the dismissal of the criminal cases on demurrer. By this failure, petitioner was denied her day in court to prosecute the respondents for their obligation to pay their loan.\n\nMoreover, we take into consideration the trial court's observation when it dismissed the estafa charge in Criminal Case No. 98-969953 that if there was any liability on the part of respondents, it was civil in nature. Hence, if the loan be proven true, the inability of petitioner to recover the loaned amount would be tantamount to unjust enrichment of respondents, as they may now conveniently evade payment of their obligation merely on account of a technicality applied against petitioner.\n\nThere is unjust enrichment when (1) a person is unjustly benefited, and (2) such benefit is derived at the expense of or with damages to another. This doctrine simply means that a person shall not be allowed to profit or enrich himself inequitably at another's expense. One condition for invoking this principle of unjust enrichment is that the aggrieved party has no other recourse based on contract, quasi-contract, crime, quasi-delict or any other provision of law. [26]\n\nCourt litigations are primarily designed to search for the truth, and a liberal interpretation and application of the rules which will give the parties the fullest opportunity to adduce proof is the best way to ferret out the truth. The dispensation of justice and vindication of legitimate grievances should not be barred by technicalities. [27] For reasons of substantial justice and equity, as the complement of the legal jurisdiction that seeks to dispense justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and want of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, are incompetent to do so, [28] we thus rule, pro hac vice , in favor of petitioner.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED. Civil Case No. 05-112452 entitled Anita Cheng v. Spouses William Sy and Tessie Sy is hereby ordered REINSTATED.

When the accused in a criminal prosecution is acquitted on the ground that his guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, a civil action for damages for the same act or omission may be instituted. Such action requires only a preponderance of evidence. Upon motion of the defendant, the court may require the plaintiff to file a bond to answer for damages in case the complaint should be found to be malicious.\n\n[13] Section 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions. - When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability is impliedly instituted with the criminal action, unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves his right to institute it separately, or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.\n\nSuch civil action includes recovery of indemnity under the Revised Penal Code, and damages under Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil Code of the Philippines arising from the same act or omission of the accused.\n\nA waiver of any of the civil actions extinguishes the others. The institution of, or the reservation of the right to file, any of said civil actions separately waives the others.\n\nThe reservation of the right to institute the separate civil actions shall be made before the prosecution starts to present its evidence and under circumstances affording the offended party a reasonable opportunity to make such reservation.\n\nIn no case may the offended party recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the accused.\n\nWhen the offended party seeks to enforce civil liability against the accused by way of moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary damages, the filing fees for such civil action as provided in these Rules shall constitute a first lien on the judgment except in an award for actual damages.\n\nIn cases wherein the amount of damages, other than actual, is alleged in the complaint or information, the corresponding filing fees shall be paid by the offended party upon the filing thereof in court for trial.

(Unilab), herein respondents.\u00a0 Also impleaded as respondents are Unilab\u2019s officers, Jose Yao Campos, Carlos Ejercito, Ernesto Salazar, Eliezer Salazar, and Jose Solidum, Jr.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Unilab initially hired Samaniego as Professional Service Representative of its marketing arm, Westmont.\u00a0 Later, Unilab promoted him as Senior Business Development Associate and assigned him in Isabela as Acting District Manager of Westmont and Chairman of Unilab Special Projects.\u00a0\u00a0 In August 1995, he was transferred to Metro Manila pending investigation of his subordinate and physicians of Region II involved in a sales discount and Rx trade-off controversy.\u00a0\u00a0 He was then placed under \u201cfloating status\u201d and assigned to perform duties not connected with his position, like fetching at the airport physicians coming from the provinces; making deposits in banks; fetching field men and doing messengerial works.\u00a0\u00a0 His transfer to Metro Manila resulted in the diminution of his salary as his per diem was reduced from P13,194.00 to P2,299.00 only.\n\nOn June 26, 1998, Westmont and Unilab filed a motion to dismiss Samaniego\u2019s complaint on the ground of improper venue and lack of cause of action.\u00a0 They argued that the complaint should have been filed with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in Manila, not with the Office of the Labor Arbiter in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan; and that the action should only be against Westmont, Samaniego\u2019s employer.\n\nSamaniego filed an Opposition to the motion to which Westmont and Unilab filed a Reply.\n\nOn August 13, 1998, the Labor Arbiter denied the motion to dismiss, citing Section 1, Rule IV of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 This provision allows the Labor Arbiter to order a change of venue in meritorious cases.\n\nThe Labor Arbiter then set the case for preliminary conference during which Westmont and Unilab expressly reserved their right to contest the order denying their motion to dismiss.\n\nOn September 3, 1998, Westmont and Unilab filed with the NLRC an Urgent Petition to Change or Transfer Venue.\u00a0\u00a0 On the same date, they filed with the Office of the Labor Arbiter in Cagayan a Motion to Suspend Proceedings in view of the pendency of their petition for change or transfer of venue in the NLRC.\n\nOn September 8, 1998, the Labor Arbiter issued an Order directing the parties to submit their respective position papers and supporting documents within twenty (20) days from notice, after which the case shall be deemed submitted for decision.\n\nOn September 22, 1998, the NLRC, acting on the petition to change venue, directed the Labor Arbiter to forward to the NLRC the records of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 The Labor Arbiter retained the complete duplicate original copies of the records and set the case for hearing. Westmont and Unilab repeatedly filed motions for cancellation of the scheduled dates of hearing on the ground that their petition for change of venue has remained unresolved.\u00a0 They did not file their position papers nor did they attend the hearing.\u00a0 Thus, the Labor Arbiter considered the case submitted for Decision based on the records and the evidence submitted by Samaniego.\n\nOn December 16, 1998, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision finding that Samaniego was \u201cillegally and unjustly dismissed constructively\u201d and ordering his reinstatement to his former position without loss of seniority rights and privileges; and payment of his full backwages from the date of his dismissal from the service up to the date of his actual reinstatement, as well as per diem differential, profit share, and actual, moral and exemplary damages, plus 10% attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nOn January 21, 1999, Westmont and Unilab interposed an appeal to the NLRC.\u00a0\u00a0 In its Resolution dated August 31, 1999, the NLRC dismissed the petition for change of venue, holding that when the cause of action arose, Samaniego\u2019s workplace was in Isabela over which the Labor Arbiter in Cagayan has jurisdiction; and that the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Decision is not appealable.\n\nIn the same Resolution, the NLRC declared the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Decision null and void, finding that:\nx x x the Executive Labor Arbiter below only allowed the transmittal of the official records of the instant case to the Commission.\u00a0 Throwing caution into the wind, he retained complete duplicate original copies of the same, conducted further proceedings and rendered his now contested Decision despite the pendency of the appeal-treated Urgent Petition for Change of Venue.\n\nAs a consequence, respondents-appellants were deprived of their opportunity to be heard and defend themselves on the issues raised in the instant case.\u00a0 They were therefore denied of their right to due process of law in violation of Section 1, Article III of the Constitution which provides: \u201cNo person shall be deprived of his....property without due process of law.\u201d\nThe dispositive portion of the NLRC Resolution reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the main Appeal and Motion to Quash are hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED and the appeal-treated Petition for Change of Venue DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction and/or merit. Accordingly, the Decision appealed from is declared NULL and VOID and the Order appealed from SUSTAINED insofar as the denial of the Motion to Dismiss is concerned. The entire records of the instant case are DIRECTED to be immediately remanded to the Executive Labor Arbiter of origin for immediate conduct of further proceeding. The respondents-appellants are DIRECTED to pay complainant-appellee the amount of Two Hundred Thirty Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty Pesos and Thirty Centavos (P230,720.30) representing his salary from January 1, 1999 to August 31, 1999, the date of issuance of this Resolution less any salary collected by him by way of execution pending appeal.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nThe parties separately filed their motions for reconsideration but were both denied by the NLRC in its Resolution dated June 27, 2000.\n\nOn January 8, 2001, the Court of Appeals, acting on the parties\u2019 petitions for certiorari,\u00a0 rendered its Decision setting aside the NLRC Resolutions and affirming with modification the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Decision in the sense that the award of moral damages was reduced from P5,000,000.00 to P500,000.00; and the exemplary damages from P1,000,000.00 to P300,000.00, thus: x x x\n\nWhile this Court concurs with the ruling of the Executive Labor Arbiter that there was constructive dismissal committed against Ricardo Samaniego, this Court finds the award on moral and exemplary damages unconscionable.\n\nx x x\n\nWHEREFORE, the NLRC\u2019s resolutions dated August 31, 1999 and June 27, 2000 are hereby SET ASIDE.\u00a0 The decision of the Executive Labor Arbiter dated December 16, 1998 is REINSTATED and AFFIRMED in all respect except with the following modification: the moral and exemplary damages are reduced to P500,000.00 and P300,000.00, respectively.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nHence, these consolidated petitions for review on certiorari filed by the opposing parties.\n\nIn their petition, Westmont and Unilab allege that the Court of Appeals erred in denying their motion to dismiss by reason of improper venue and in sustaining the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Decision declaring that Samaniego was constructively dismissed; and that they were denied due process.\n\nFor his part, Samaniego maintains that the Court of Appeals did not err in its ruling.\u00a0\u00a0 However, he claims that the Appellate Court should not have reduced the Labor Arbiter\u2019s award for moral and exemplary damages.\n\nThe petition to change or transfer venue filed by Westmont and Unilab with the NLRC is not the proper remedy to assail the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Order denying their motion to dismiss.\u00a0\u00a0 Such Order is merely interlocutory, hence, not appealable.\u00a0 Section 3, Rule V of the Rules of Procedure of the NLRC, as amended, provides:\nSECTION 3. Motion to Dismiss . On or before the date set for the conference, the respondent may file a motion to dismiss. Any motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, improper venue , or that the cause of action is barred by prior judgment, prescription or forum shopping, shall be immediately resolved by the Labor Arbiter by a written order. An order denying the motion to dismiss or suspending its resolution until the final determination of the case is not appealable. In Indiana Aerospace University v. Commission on Higher Education, [3] we held:\nAn order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory, and so the proper remedy in such a case is to appeal after a decision has been rendered.\nAssuming that the petition to change or transfer venue is the proper remedy, still we find that the Court of Appeals did not err in sustaining the Labor Arbiter\u2019s Order denying the motion to dismiss.\n\nSection 1(a), Rule IV of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, as amended, provides:\nSECTION 1. Venue . \u2013 (a) All cases which Labor Arbiters have authority to hear and decide may be filed in the Regional Arbitration Branch having jurisdiction over the workplace of the complainant/petitioner.\n\nFor purposes of venue, workplace shall be understood as the place or locality where the employee is regularly assigned when the cause of action arose . It shall include the place where the employee is supposed to report back after a temporary detail, assignment or travel.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of field employees, as well as ambulant or itinerant workers, their workplace is where they are regularly assigned, or where they are supposed to regularly receive their salaries/wages or work instructions from and report the results of their assignment to, their employers.\nIn Sulpicio Lines, Inc. v. NLRC, [4] we held:\nThe question of venue essentially relates to the trial and touches more upon the convenience of the parties, rather than upon the substance and merits of the case. Our permissive rules underlying provisions on venue are intended to assure convenience for the plaintiff and his witnesses and to promote the ends of justice.\u00a0 This axiom all the more finds applicability in cases involving labor and management because of the principle, paramount in our jurisdiction, that the State shall afford full protection to labor.\n\nx x x\n\nThis provision is obviously permissive, for the said section uses the word \"may,\" allowing a different venue when the interests of substantial justice demand a different one. In any case, as stated earlier, the Constitutional protection accorded to labor is a paramount and compelling factor, provided the venue chosen is not altogether oppressive to the employer.\nHere, it is undisputed that Samaniego\u2019s regular place of assignment was in Isabela when he was transferred to Metro Manila or when the cause of action arose.\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly, the Appellate Court was correct in affirming the Labor Arbiter\u2019s finding that the proper venue is in the RAB No. II at Tuguegarao City, Cagayan.\n\nOn the contention of Westmont and Unilab that they were denied due process, well settled is the rule that the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard or, as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one\u2019s side or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.\u00a0\u00a0 The requirement of due process in labor cases before a Labor Arbiter is satisfied when the parties are given the opportunity to submit their position papers to which they are supposed to attach all the supporting documents or documentary evidence that would prove their respective claims, in the event the Labor Arbiter determines that no formal hearing would be conducted or that such hearing was not necessary. [5]\n\nAs shown by the records, the Labor Arbiter gave Westmont and Unilab, not only once, but thrice, the opportunity to submit their position papers and supporting affidavits and documents.\u00a0\u00a0 But they were obstinate.\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly, they were not denied their right to due process.\n\nThe ultimate issue for our resolution is whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that Samaniego was constructively dismissed by Westmont and Unilab.\n\nTo recapitulate, Samaniego claims that upon his reassignment and/or transfer to Metro Manila, he was placed on \u201cfloating status\u201d and directed to perform functions not related to his position.\u00a0\u00a0 For their part, Westmont and Unilab explain that\u00a0 his\u00a0 transfer is based on a sound business judgment, a management prerogative.\n\nIn constructive dismissal, the employer has the burden of proving that the transfer of an employee is for just and valid grounds, such as genuine business necessity.\u00a0\u00a0 The employer must be able to show that the transfer is not unreasonable, inconvenient, or prejudicial to the employee.\u00a0\u00a0 It must not involve a demotion in rank or a diminution of salary and other benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 If the employer cannot overcome this burden of proof, the employee\u2019s transfer shall be tantamount to unlawful constructive dismissal. [6]\n\nWestmont and Unilab failed to discharge this burden.\u00a0 Samaniego was unceremoniously transferred from Isabela to Metro Manila.\u00a0 We hold that such transfer is economically and emotionally burdensome on his part.\u00a0\u00a0 He was constrained to maintain two residences \u2013 one for himself in Metro Manila, and the other for his family in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan.\u00a0\u00a0 Worse, immediately after his transfer to Metro Manila, he was placed \u201con floating status\u201d and was demoted in rank, performing functions no longer supervisory in nature.\n\nThere may also be constructive dismissal if an act of clear insensibility or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him except to forego his continued employment. [7] This was what happened to Samaniego.\u00a0 Thus, he is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights, full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits or their monetary equivalent, computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement. [8]\n\nHowever, the circumstances obtaining in this case do not warrant the reinstatement of Samaniego.\u00a0\u00a0 Antagonism caused a severe strain in the relationship between him and his employer.\u00a0 A more equitable disposition would be an award of separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay, or one month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher (with a fraction of at least six [6] months being considered as one [1] whole year), [9] in addition to his full backwages, allowances and other benefits. [10]\n\nRecords show that Samaniego was employed from October 1982 to May 27, 1998, [11] or for sixteen (16) years and seven (7) months, with a monthly salary of P25,000.00.\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, he is entitled to a separation pay of P425,000.00.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 60400 and CA-G.R. SP No. 60478 are AFFIRMED, with MODIFICATION in the sense that Westmont and Unilab are ordered to pay Samaniego his separation pay equivalent to P425,000.00, plus his full backwages, and other privileges and benefits, or their monetary equivalent, from the time of his dismissal up to his supposed actual reinstatement.\u00a0\u00a0 The award for moral and exemplary damages is deleted.\n\nCosts against Westmont and Unilab.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairman), Azcuna and Garcia, JJ. , concur.\nCorona, J. , on leave\n\n[1] Penned by Justice Eugenio S.

TACANLOY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nThis is a petition for review [1] of the Decision [2] dated 31 March 1999 and the Resolution dated 23 June 1999 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 51930. The Court of Appeals dismissed the special civil action for certiorari, assailing the resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (\"NLRC\"). The NLRC affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter holding that Teodulo C. Alcovendas, Cesar W. Labrador, [3] and Jordan T. Tacanloy (\"private respondents\") were illegally dismissed.\n\nThe Facts\n\nOn 13 July 1993, Teodulo C. Alcovendas (\"Alcovendas\"), Cesar W. Labrador (\"Labrador\"), and Jordan T. Tacanloy (\"Tacanloy\") filed a case against Philippine Military Veterans Security and Investigation Agency and its President and General Manager, Ramon Macorol (\"petitioners\") for illegal dismissal, underpayment of wages, non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, night differential pay, service incentive leave pay, rest day pay, and 13 th month pay.\n\nThe evidence submitted by private respondents to the Labor Arbiter show their employment record with Philippine Military Veterans Security and Investigation Agency (\"PMVSIA\") as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n1) Teodulo Alcovendas | | \n | | \n8/31/85 - 12/31/861/1/87 - 12/30/901/1/91 - 8/31/928/31/92 - 2/23/93 | Security GuardSecurity GuardSecurity OfficerInspector | P1,000/monthP1,200/monthP1,600/monthP2,500/month\n | | \n2) Cesar W.

However, petitioners failed to present a copy of Alcovendas' resignation letter because Alcovendas allegedly stole it from petitioners' files to make it appear that he did not resign from his job. The prosecutor dismissed the case for qualified theft that petitioners filed against Alcovendas. However, petitioners insist that the dismissal is not binding on the labor tribunal. Petitioners assert that dismissal for loss of confidence based on suspected theft of company property is a valid cause for dismissal even if the employee is subsequently acquitted.\n\nPetitioners allege that the dismissal of Labrador and Tacanloy was due to loss of trust and confidence. As Operations Manager, Labrador allegedly accepted unqualified applicants for security guards and facilitated the processing of their papers. Tacanloy, on the other hand, allegedly engaged in black propaganda intended to discredit petitioners' reputation. Petitioners further allege that Tacanloy, in connivance with Alcovendas and Labrador, filed a malicious suit against petitioners.\n\nOn 8 July 1996, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision in favor of private respondents. The Labor Arbiter held that petitioners illegally dismissed private respondents. The Labor Arbiter ordered the payment of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. In the computation of the money claims, the Labor Arbiter took into consideration the three-year prescriptive period within which money claims should be filed. [5] The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's Decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents to pay complainants the total amount of P80,829.46 representing their separation pay and underpayment of wages inclusive of 10% attorney's fees, individually computed as follows:\n\nTEODULO C.

[6]\n\nOn appeal, the NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision. Upon denial of their motion for reconsideration, petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn 31 March 1999, the Court of Appeals dismissed the special civil action for certiorari. Hence, this petition.\n\nIssue\n\nThe sole issue is whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the resolution of the NLRC, which upheld the decision of the Labor Arbiter that petitioners illegally dismissed private respondents who should therefore receive separation pay, backwages, attorney's fees and salary differential.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe petition is without merit.\n\nFactual Findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC\n\nWe uphold the ruling of the Court of Appeals sustaining the findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC that petitioners illegally dismissed private respondents. The Court of Appeals held that the evidence on record supported such findings. [7]\n\nFactual findings of labor officials, who possess the expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, have conclusive effect on this Court provided substantial evidence support such factual findings. [8] More so in this case, where the findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC coincide, and the Court of Appeals sustained such findings. [9]\n\nAs found by the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, petitioners failed to prove their assertion that Alcovendas voluntarily resigned. Petitioners assert that Alcovendas stole his letter of resignation. However, the Prosecutor dismissed for insufficiency of evidence the charge for qualified theft against Alcovendas for allegedly stealing company documents, including his own letter of resignation. [10] In the labor case, petitioners also failed to present substantial evidence to establish the charge of qualified theft against Alcovendas.\n\nPetitioners were likewise unable to support their claim that Labrador was involved in faking the licenses of security guards who were not qualified. The Labor Arbiter held:\nRespondents herein alleged that Labrador was validly terminated on June 5, 1993 for dishonesty involving the faking of guards' licenses. Again, this alleged offense was never established by evidence. Invisible on record are the supposed documents issued to Labrador such as the notice of offense, notice requiring him to explain and the sworn statement of witnesses attesting to the charge. Even the very letter of termination dated June 14, 1993 served to Labrado[r] terminating the latter's services does not contain the alleged cause for his termination. We therefore rule that the termination of complainant Labrador from employment was contrary to law. [11] Petitioners also failed to substantiate their claim that Tacanloy engaged in black propaganda to discredit petitioners' reputation. The Labor Arbiter held that petitioners failed to establish fraud and breach of trust on the part of Tacanloy which would justify termination of his employment. [12]\n\nWe find no reason to deviate from the findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC. Petitioners failed to substantiate their allegations and accusations against private respondents. Although proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required, substantial evidence is necessary and the burden lies on the employer to establish that there was no illegal dismissal. [13] This is in accord with Article 277 of the Labor Code, which explicitly states that the employer has the burden of proving that the termination of the employee is for a valid or authorized cause. The petitioners failed to discharge this burden, which makes a finding for illegal dismissal inevitable. [14]\n\nLoss of Trust and Confidence\n\nArticle 282(c) of the Labor Code provides that an employer may terminate an employee for fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative. An employer cannot be compelled to continue the employment of an employee who is guilty of acts inimical to the interest of the employer and which justifies loss of confidence in the employee. [15] However, the right of an employer to terminate an employee based on loss of confidence must not be exercised arbitrarily and without just cause. [16]\n\nIn Northwest Tourism Corp. v. Court of Appeals, Former Special Third Division, [17] we held:\nLoss of trust and confidence as a ground for dismissal does not entail proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employee's misconduct. However, the evidence must be substantial and must establish clearly and convincingly the facts on which the loss of confidence in the employee rests. To be a valid reason for dismissal, loss of confidence must be genuine. Uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not suffice, otherwise it will jeopardize the constitutional guaranty of security of tenure of the employee. In this case, petitioners failed to prove the acts and misconduct imputed upon private respondents which would justify their dismissal on the ground of loss of confidence.\n\nSalary Differential, Attorney's Fees, Separation Pay, and Backwages\n\nWe affirm the award of salary differential. [18] As found by the Labor Arbiter, PMVSIA paid private respondents wages which were below the minimum rate for security guards as prescribed and adopted by the Philippine Association of Detective [and Protective] Agency Operators, Inc. (PADPAO). [19] Petitioners failed to refute the Labor Arbiter's finding of underpayment of wages.\n\nWe also sustain the award of attorney's fees. We have held that \"[i]n actions for recovery of wages or where an employee was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, he is entitled to an award of attorney's fees.\" [20]\n\nWe, however, modify the amount of separation pay. The payment of separation pay may be granted when reinstatement is no longer feasible. [21] Separation pay is equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service up to the finality of this Decision. Thus, the computation for the separation pay should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nFinally, we rule that private respondents are entitled to backwages. Article 279 of the Labor Code reads:\nART. 279. Security of Tenure. - In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement. In accordance with this provision, illegally dismissed private respondents are entitled to full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits. Where reinstatement is no longer possible, as in this case, the backwages shall be computed from the time of the employee's illegal termination up to the finality of the decision. [22]\n\nWHEREFORE, we AFFIRM with MODIFICATION the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 31 March 1999 and its Resolution dated 23 June 1999. We SUSTAIN the award of salary differential and attorney's fees. We REMAND this case to the Labor Arbiter for the computation, within thirty days from receipt of this Decision, of separation pay and backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits due to Teodulo C. Alcovendas, Cesar W. Labrador and Jordan T. Tacanloy, from the time of their illegal dismissal until the finality of this Decision.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nQuisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales, and Tinga, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[2] Penned by Associate Justice Ramon A.

VILLANUEVA AND EVER PAWNSHOP, PETITIONERS, VS. SPS. ALEJO SALVADOR AND VIRGINIA SALVADOR, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nAssailed and sought to be set aside in this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is the July 16, 1999 decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 49965, which affirmed in toto an earlier decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) at Pasig in Civil Case No. 62334.\n\nThe pertinent facts:\n\nOn December 20, 1991, herein respondents, the spouses Alejo Salvador and Virginia Salvador (Salvadors, collectively), secured a loan of P7,650.00 from petitioner Ever Pawnshop owned and managed by co-petitioner Enrico B. Villanueva (Villanueva). On January 23, 1992, the Salvadors took out a second loan of P5,400.00 pledging, just like in the first loan transaction, jewelry items. Pawnshop Ticket No. 29919, covering the first loan, indicated April 10, 1992 as the last day to redeem the jewelries pawned, whereas the redemption period for the items given as security for the second loan under Pawnshop Ticket No. 30792 fell on May 22, 1992.\n\nThe separate redemption periods came and went, but the Salvadors failed to redeem the pawned pieces of jewelry. Nonetheless, on June 1, 1992, their son paid Ever Pawnshop P7,000.00, the amount to be applied against the first loan of P7,650.00. On account of this development, Pawnshop Ticket No. 29919 was cancelled and replaced by Pawnshop Ticket No. 34932. Vis-a-vis the second loan, Ever Pawnshop agreed to the extension of the maturity date to June 30, 1992, provided the Salvadors pay 20% of their second loan obligation on or before June 4, 1992, failing which the securing items shall be auctioned as scheduled. Unlike in the first loan, however, a new pawn ticket was not issued for the second loan.\n\nIn the meantime, Ever Pawnshop issued a notice announcing the public auction sale on June 4, 1992 of all January 1 to 31, 1992 unredeemed pledges. The notice appeared in the Classified Ads Section of the Manila Bulletin on June 4, 1992, the very day of the auction itself.\n\nOn July 1, 1992, the Salvadors repaired to the pawnshop in a bid to renew the second loan by tendering the aforesaid 20% of the amount due thereon, only to be informed that the pledged jewelry had already been auctioned as scheduled on June 4, 1992. As found by the CA, however, pieces of the pawned jewelry items were still in the shop, [3] indicating that Ever Pawnshop either bought some of the unredeemed pledges or did not sell them.\n\nA month after, Mrs. Salvador attempted to redeem the jewelry items pledged for the first loan, as renewed, but all she got in response were unclear information as to their whereabouts.\n\nOn August 7, 1992, Mr. Salvador tendered payment of the amount due on both loans, with a demand for the return of the jewelry thus pledged. Ever Pawnshop, however, refused to accept the tender.\n\nSuch was the state of things when, on August 11, 1992, at the RTC-Pasig City, the Salvadors filed a complaint for damages against Villanueva and Ever Pawnshop arising from the sale without notice of the two (2) sets of jewelry pledged as security for both loans. The complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 62334, was eventually raffled to Branch 164 of the court.\n\nBarely two days after Villanueva et al., received summons, their counsel informed the Salvadors of his clients' willingness to accept payment heretofore tendered for the redemption of the jewelry pledged to secure the first loan. The Salvadors, however, turned down this belated offer.\n\nAnswering, Villanueva and Ever Pawnshop, as defendants a quo, averred, inter alia, that by letters dated March 23, 1992 and May 5, 1992, Ever Pawnshop reminded the Salvadors of the maturity dates and redemption period of their loans. Also alleged in the answer with counterclaim for damages was the publication in the June 4, 1992 issue of the Manila Bulletin of the notice of public auction of all unredeemed pledges from January 1 to 31, 1992.\n\nEventually, in a decision [4] dated January 25, 1995, the trial court, on its finding that the set of jewelry covered by the renewed first and second loans were sold without the necessary notice, rendered judgment for the Salvadors, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiffs [Salvadors] and against the defendants [Villanueva and Ever Pawnshop]. Defendants are hereby ordered to pay to the plaintiffs:\nThe sum of P20,000.00 by way of moral damages;\n\nThe sum of P5,400.00 as the value of the jewelry sold under the second loan;\n\nThe sum of P5,000.00 as and for attorney's fees; and\n\nThe costs of suit.\nDefendants are also ordered to restore to the possession of the\n[Salvadors] the jewelry that they pawned under the first loan, covered\nby pawn ticket nos. 29919 and 34932, upon payment by the plaintiffs of\nthe redemption price due last 10 August 1992.\n\nThe counterclaim of the defendants is dismissed.\n\nSO ORDERED. (Words in bracket added.) Therefrom, petitioners went on appeal to the CA whereat their recourse was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 49965.\n\nAs stated at the threshold hereof, the CA, in its decision of July 16, 1999, affirmed in toto that of the trial court, the affirmance being predicated on the following main justifications:\nAs the trial court correctly pointed out, the May 5, 1992 \"List of Notified Clients\" (Exhs. 6, 6-A, 6-B ) . . . including the names of the [respondents] and Ticket Nos. 29919 and 30792 is not proof that notices were actually sent to [respondents]. While the list contains 132 names, only 98 [postage] stamps were purchased, hence, it cannot be determined who among the 132 people were sent notices.\n\nAnd as surmised by the trial court, the set of jewelry pledged to secure the first loan must have been auctioned, as scheduled on May 7, 1992, but that by mistake the pledge was renewed (on June 1, 1992), that is why it was only after the [petitioners] received the summons in late August 1992 when probably they recovered the pledged jewelry that they expressed willingness to accept the [respondents'] tender of payment for the redemption of said pledge jewelry securing the first (renewed) loan.\n\nAdmittedly, the [respondents] did not pay their loans on maturity. But [petitioners] breached their contractual and legal obligation to inform the [respondents] of the public auction of the jewelry securing it.\n\nFurthermore, [petitioners] failed to comply with the requirements . . . that the notice must be published during the week preceding the sale in two daily newspapers of general circulation in the city or municipality. The paid notice of public auction to be held on June 4, 1992 by Ever Pawnshop was published only on even date, and only in one newspaper, the Manila Bulletin. And particularly with respect to the second loan, why was the jewelry pledged to secure it included in the June 4, 1992 auction when plaintiffs had up to that date to pay 20% of the amount due thereunder as a condition to its renewal?\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAnent the questioned award of moral damages: Even assuming that [respondents'] failure to pay their obligation on maturity amounts to contributory negligence, that does not abate the award of moral damages in their favor given the [petitioners'] failure to comply with the contractual and statutory requirements before the pledged jewelry was auctioned which failure amounts to misconduct contemplated in Article 2220 of the New Civil Code - basis of the award thereof (Laguna Tayabas Bus Company v. Cornista 11 SCRA 181- 182 (Words in bracket added) Hence, this petition on the following issues:\nWhether the items of jewelry under the first loan were actually sold by the petitioners;\n\nWhether valid notice of the sale of the pledged jewelry was effected;\n\nWhether the award of P20,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as attorneys fees are proper; and\n\nWhether the trial and appellate courts erred in ordering both the petitioners to pay damages. Under the first issue, petitioners fault the CA in holding that the jewelry pledged under the first loan was sold by them.\n\nDoubtless, the first issue raised by petitioners relates to the correctness of the factual finding of the CA - confirmatory of that of the trial court - on the disposition of the set of jewelry covered by Pawnshop Ticket No. 34932. Such issue is beyond the province of the Court to review since it is not its function to analyze or weigh all over again the evidence or premises supportive of such factual determination. [5] The Court has consistently held that the findings of the CA must be accorded great weight and shall not be disturbed on appeal, save for the most compelling and cogent reasons, [6] like when manifest error has been committed. [7]\n\nAs nothing in the record indicates any of such exceptions, the factual conclusion of the CA that petitioners indeed sold the jewelry items given to secure the first loan must be affirmed.\n\nIndeed, petitioner pawnshop expressed willingness to accept tender of payment and to return the pawned jewelry only after being served with summons. Apparently, Ever Pawnshop had found a way to recover said jewelry by that time. If, as aptly observed by the CA, the jewelry had never been sold, as petitioners so allege, but had been in their possession all along, they could have provided a plausible explanation for the initial refusal to accept tender of payment and to return the jewelry. Petitioners' belated overture to accept payment after spurning the initial offer to pay can only be due to the fact that, when respondents offered to pay the first time around, they (petitioners) no longer had possession of the jewelry items in question, having previously disposed of them.\n\nMoving on to the second issue, petitioners argue that the respondents were effectively put on notice of the sale of the pledged jewelries, the maturity date and expiry date of redemption period of the two loans being indicated on the face of each of the covering pawnshop tickets. Pressing the point, petitioners invite attention to the caveat printed on the dorsal side of the tickets stating that the pledged items shall be auctioned off in the event they are not redeemed before the expiry date of the redemption period.\n\nWe are not persuaded by petitioners' faulty argument.\n\nSection 13 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) 114, otherwise known as the Pawnshop Regulation Act, and even the terms and conditions of the pledge itself, accord the pawner a 90-day grace period from the date of maturity of the loan obligation within which to redeem the pawn. But even before the lapse of the 90-day period, the same Decree requires the pawnbroker to notify the defaulting debtor of the proposed auction sale. Section 14 thereof provides:\nSection 14. Disposition of pawn on default of pawner.- In the event the pawner fails to redeem the pawn within ninety days from the date of maturity of the obligation . . ., the pawnbroker may sell . . . any article taken or received by him in pawn: Provided, however, that the pawner shall be duly notified of such sale on or before the termination of the ninety-day period, the notice particularly stating the date, hour and place of the sale. However, over and above the foregoing prescription is the mandatory requirement for the publication of such notice once in at least two daily newspapers during the week preceding the date of the auction sale. [8]\n\nThe CA cannot really be faulted for making short shrift of petitioners' posture respecting their alleged compliance with the notice requirement in question. As it were, petitioner Ever Pawnshop, as determined by the CA, only caused publication of the auction in one newspaper, i.e., the Manila Bulletin, and on the very day of the scheduled auction sale itself, instead of a week preceding the sale as prescribed by Section 15 of P.D. 114. Verily, a notice of an auction sale made on the very scheduled auction day itself defeats the purpose of the notice, which is to inform a pawner beforehand that a sale is to occur so that he may have that last chance to redeem his pawned items.\n\nThis brings us to the issue of the award of moral damages which petitioners correctly tag as erroneous, and, therefore, should be deleted.\n\nWhile proof of pecuniary loss is unnecessary to justify an award of moral damages, the amount of indemnity being left to the sound discretion of the court, it is, nevertheless, essential that the claimant satisfactorily proves the existence of the factual basis of the damages [9] and its causal connection to defendant's wrongful act or omission. This is so because moral damages, albeit incapable of pecuniary estimation, are designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered and not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer. [10] There is thus merit on petitioners' assertion that proof of moral suffering must precede a moral damage award. [11]\n\nThe conditions required in awarding moral damages are: (1) there must be an injury, whether physical, mental or psychological, clearly sustained by the claimant; (2) there must be a culpable act or omission factually established; (3) the wrongful act or omission of the defendant must be the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the claimant; and (4) the award of damages is predicated on any of the cases stated in Article 2219 of the Civil Code. [12]\n\nWhile there need not be a showing that the defendant acted in a wanton or malevolent manner, as this is a requirement for an award of exemplary damages, [13] there must still be proof of fraudulent action or bad faith for a claim for moral damages to succeed. [14] Then, too, moral damages are generally not recoverable in culpa contractual except when bad faith supervenes and is proven. [15]\n\nBad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of known duty through some motive or interest or ill-will that partakes of the nature of the fraud. [16] And to the person claiming moral damages rests the onus of proving by convincing evidence the existence of bad faith, for good faith is presumed. [17]\n\nAs aptly pointed out by petitioners, the trial court concluded that the respondents' \"cause of action arose merely from the negligence of the herein [petitioners].\" [18] It may be that gross negligence may sometimes amount to bad faith. [19] But what is before us is a matter of simple negligence only, it being the trial court's categorical finding that the case came about owing to petitioners' mistake in renewing the loan when the sale of the article to secure the loan had already been effected. Wrote the trial court:\n\"What must have happened next was that the jewelry under the first loan was sold, as scheduled, on 7 May 1992. Due to an oversight, the defendants mistakenly renewed the first loan on 1 June 1992, issuing pawn ticket number 34932 in the process.\" [20] [Emphasis supplied] The CA's reliance on Article 2220 of the Civil Code in affirming the award of moral damages is misplaced. Said article provides:\nArt. 2220. Willful injury to property may be a legal ground for awarding moral damages if the court should find that, under the circumstances, such damages are justly due. The same rule applies to breaches of contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith. Clear it is from the above that before moral damages may be assessed thereunder, the defendant's act must be vitiated by bad faith or that there is willful intent to injure. Simply put, moral damages cannot arise from simple negligence.\n\nThe award of attorney's fees should, likewise, be struck down, both the CA and trial court having failed to explain respondents' entitlement thereto. As a matter of sound practice, an award of attorney's fee has always been regarded as the exception rather than the rule. Counsel's fees are, to be sure, not awarded every time a party prevails in a suit because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. Attorney's fees, as part of damages, are assessed only in the instances specified in Article 2208 of the Civil Code. [21] And it is necessary for the trial court to make express findings of fact and law that would bring the case within the exception. In short, the factual, legal or equitable justification for the award must be set forth in the text of the decision. [22] The matter of attorney's fees cannot be touched only in the fallo of the decision, else the award should be thrown out for being speculative and conjectural. [23]\n\nCertainly not lost on the Court is the fact that petitioners, after being served with summons, made an attempt to obviate litigation by offering to accept tender of payment and return the jewelry. This offer, however belated, could have saved much expense on the part of both parties, as well as the precious time of the court itself. The respondents chose to turn down this offer and pursue judicial recourse. With this in mind, it hardly seems fair to award them attorneys fees at petitioners' expense.\n\nThe final issue relating to the question of whether or not both respondents are liable for damages has, for all intent and purposes, been rendered moot and academic by the disposition just made. We need not dwell on it any further. Besides, this particular issue has only made its debut in the present recourse. And it is a well-entrenched rule that issues not raised below cannot be resolved on review in higher courts. [24] A question that was never raised in the court below cannot be allowed to be raised for the first time on appeal without offending basic rules of fair play, justice and due process. [25]\n\nWHEREFORE, with the MODIFICATION t hat the awards of moral damages and attorneys fees are deleted, the decision under review is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nNo pronouncement as to cost.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, and Azcuna, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales (now a member of this Court), with Associate Justices Artemon B.

ONG, AND REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MEYCAUAYAN, BULACAN, RESPONDENTS.R E S O L U T I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseThis is a petition for review on certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] promulgated on 14 November 2003 of the Court of Appeals (appellate court) in CA-G.R. CV No. 66048. The appellate court affirmed in toto the Decision[3] dated 30 September 1999 of Branch 11 of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan (trial court) in Civil Case No. 126-M-96 which upheld the validity of the sale by Juan Santiago in favor of Mark Vincent L. Ong of 10,926 square meters out of 31,853 square meters of co-owned property in the case filed by Juan Santiago's nephews and nieces (petitioners). Petitioners are the heirs of Jose G. Santiago, and Jose G. Santiago is Juan Santiago's brother and co-owner of the subject property. The trial court also upheld the validity of the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) issued in favor of Mark Vincent L. Ong.The FactsThe trial court narrated the facts as follows:This is an action for annulment of titles, injunction, damages and restraining order.Plaintiffs, the heirs of Jose G. Santiago, allege in their Complaint that their father and his brother Juan G. Santiago, both deceased, were registered co-owners of a parcel of land containing an area of 31,853 square meters located at Catmon, Sta. Maria, Bulacan, covered by T.C.T. No. T-117343(M) (Exh. \"A\"). That on May 26, 1992, Juan Santiago, while confined at the Chinese General Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, allegedly sold a portion of the above lot, measuring 10,926 square meters, to a two (2) year old child Mark Vincent Ong with the participation of defendant Aurea Santiago as evidenced by a Deed of Sale over a Portion of Land, dated May 26, 1992. And in support of the foregoing sale, an alleged affidavit of [non-]tenancy was executed by Juan G. Santiago. Both signatures of the latter in the said two (2) documents, according to plaintiffs, were spurious, forged and falsified by defendants who stood to benefit from it. Defendants Vicente Ong and Mark Vincent Ong, father and son respectively, were able to secure a title over the disputed lot by virtue of the falsified deed of sale and a supposed Partition Agreement dated October 15, 1994 executed by Jose Santiago and Juan Santiago who were long deceased before said date, having died on May 25, 1990 and September 21, 1992, respectively. Later on, Aurea Santiago allegedly managed to obtain a title covering the remaining 20,927 square meters, Title No. T-213216(M) issued on November 18, 1994 in the names of both Jose and Juan Santiago diminishing thereby the share of herein plaintiffs in the property.Defendant Aurea Santiago in her Answer, denied inter-alia, having committed any falsification of document relative to the lot in question nor dealing or transacting with the other defendants. She claimed that her husband, Juan Santiago, during his lifetime, merely asked her to sign her conformity to a document selling his share in the subject parcel of lot which she did without even reading the document. That she received no amount of money from any of the defendants from the sale of the said property, which in reality was a capital property of her husband excluded from their conjugal partnership. With the aforesaid sale, she came to lose, as a consequence, all claims or interests over the remainder of the lot belonging to the co-ownership.Defendants Ong in their Answer, admitted having purchased the questioned lot, with Vicente Ong explaining that the purchase was for valuable consideration in favor of her [sic] son Mark Vincent Ong, done after receiving legal advise [sic] on the matter, denying at the same time any participation in the preparation and execution of the deed of partition of the property.Plaintiff, on the stand, reiterated the allegations in the complaint with the additional information that their father, Jose, died on May 25, 1990 and their uncle, Juan, expired on September 21, 1992.Isagani Garcia, records officer of the Register of Deeds of Meycauayan, Bulacan testified on the matter of recording the documents involved in the case.Atty. Jeremias Vitan, the notary public who appeared to have notarized the deed of sale (Exh. \"B\") and the affidavit of non-tenancy (Exh. \"C\") denied his notarization alleging that his signature in both documents were forgeries.Defendant Aurea Santiago, in her testimony, merely reiterated her allegations in her Answer.So did Vicente Ong, explaining in addition the details on how he came to buy the property and the corresponding documentation thereof, which according to him, was all handled by one Atty. Santiago and a certain Lita, after the death of the latter.Plaintiffs, as the evidence shows, are after the annulment of the following documents based on fraud, to wit: Deed of Sale dated May 26, 1992 executed by the deceased Juan Santiago in favor of Mark Vincent L. Ong involving the disputed 10,926 square meters of the community property covered by T.C.T. No. T-117343(M) (Exh. \"B\");T.C.T. No. 213125(M) issued in the name of Mark Vincent L. Ong (Exh. \"E\");Subdivision Plan signed by Mark Vincent Ong and the brothers Jose and Juan Santiago (Exh. \"F\");Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-213216(M) issued in the names of Juan G. Santiago and Jose Santiago covering an area of 20,927 square meters or the remaining area of the community property (Exh. \"H\");Consolidation and Partition Agreement dated August 17, 1994 signed by Juan and Jose Santiago (Exh. \"N\").[4]The Trial Court's RulingIn its Decision dated 30 September 1999, the trial court partly denied the petitioners' claims. The trial court declared that Juan Santiago was well within his rights as a co-owner when he sold 10,926 square meters of the co-owned lot. Petitioners have no reason to complain or impugn the sale. Despite the allegations of forgery, the Ongs have in their favor the presumption of good faith in buying a portion of the co-owned lot. Vicente Ong's testimony that the late Juan Santiago's representatives carried out the documentation and registration of the property remained uncontradicted. The trial court decreed that TCT No. 213216(M) issued in the names of Juan and Jose Santiago has no legal basis. Petitioners are thus entitled to 15,000 square meters, more or less, or one-half of the 31,853 square meters of the subject property.The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: Declaring the Deed of Sale dated May 26, 1992 executed by the deceased Juan Santiago in favor of Mark Vincent L. Ong involving 10,926 square meters of the community property valid;Declaring T.C.T. No. 213125(M) issued in the name of Mark Vincent L. Ong valid;Declaring, as null and void, T.C.T. No. T-213216(M) issued in the name of Juan Santiago and Jose Santiago covering an area of 20,927 square meters of the disputed property;Directing the parties to sit down and effectuate a partition of the property in question in accordance with this decision; and Ordering the Register of Deeds of Meycauayan, Bulacan to cancel T.C.T. No. 213216(M) and issue in lieu thereof a new Transfer Certificate of Title in the name of Juan Santiago and Jose Santiago specifying their respective share in accordance with this decision.No pronouncement as to costSO ORDERED.[5]The Ruling of the Appellate CourtIn its Decision promulgated on 14 November 2003, the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The appellate court declared that Juan Santiago's sale of an undivided portion consisting of 10,926 square meters of co-owned property remains valid. Petitioners are not the real parties in interest possessing the character of a contracting party, or of heirs or assigns of the vendor. Only the estate of Juan Santiago, to the exclusion of petitioners, stands to be benefited or injured by the decision in the present case. There is a lack of convincing and credible proof to support the allegations of fraud with respect to the Absolute Deed of Sale and the Affidavit of Non-Tenancy. There is also an absence of satisfactory evidence to dispute the apparent irregularity on the signatures of Juan and Jose Santiago on the subdivision, consolidation and partition agreement.The IssuesPetitioners insist that they are the real parties in interest to bring the instant suit and that they have a cause of action against the respondents. Furthermore, petitioners assert that the Deed of Absolute Sale is void. Finally, the partition of the remaining portion of the lot cannot be done in accordance with the trial court's decision.The Ruling of the CourtThe petition has no merit.We see no reason to overturn the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts. Therefore, we do not divert from their rulings.Petitioners are not real parties in interest and therefore have no cause of action in bringing the present case. A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.[6] A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another.[7] In the present case, there is no dispute that Juan Santiago owned half of the subject lot while the other half belonged to his brother Jose. Juan Santiago merely exercised his right when he sold a portion of his undivided half to Mark Vincent L. Ong. Petitioners question Juan's transaction even though petitioners are neither parties to the contract nor heirs or assigns of Juan Santiago.[8] Juan Santiago left a probated will leaving all his properties to his wife Aurea, to the exclusion of petitioners. As heirs of Jose Santiago, co-owner of the subject property, petitioners may only question the sale if their right of preemption under the Civil Code of the Philippines[9] was disregarded, and they wish to exercise such right. However, petitioners do not seek to exercise the right of preemption. Thus, they are not real parties in interest in the present case.We likewise affirm the lower courts' ruling on the validity of the Deed of Sale, even though petitioners have no personality to question the same before this Court. Apart from their allegations, petitioners failed to prove that Juan Santiago was incapacitated to contract at the time of the execution of the Deed of Sale.Finally, we affirm the lower courts' ruling that TCT No. 213216(M) issued in the names of Jose and Juan Santiago be nullified and a new one issued to reflect the shares in the remaining portions of the subject property. The estate of Juan Santiago can only claim 5,000 square meters, more or less, of the remaining 20,927 square meters of the subject property.WHEREFORE, we DENY the petition. We AFFIRM the Decision promulgated on 14 November 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 66048.

The heir is not liable beyond the value of the property he received from the decedent.If a contract should contain some stipulation in favor of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment provided he communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its revocation. A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person is not sufficient. The contracting parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.[9] Article 1623 of the Civil Codes provides:The right of legal preemption or redemption shall not be exercised except within thirty days from the notice in writing by the prospective vendor, or by the vendor, as the case may be. The deed of sale shall not be recorded in the Registry of Property unless accompanied by an affidavit of the vendor that he has given written notice thereof to all possible redemptioners.The right of redemption of co-owners excludes that of adjoining owners.

Ong (Exh. \"E\");\n\nSubdivision Plan signed by Mark Vincent Ong and the brothers Jose and Juan Santiago (Exh. \"F\");\n\nTransfer Certificate of Title No. T-213216(M) issued in the names of Juan G. Santiago and Jose Santiago covering an area of 20,927 square meters or the remaining area of the community property (Exh. \"H\");\n\nConsolidation and Partition Agreement dated August 17, 1994 signed by Juan and Jose Santiago (Exh. \"N\"). [4]\n\nThe Trial Court's Ruling\n\nIn its Decision dated 30 September 1999, the trial court partly denied the petitioners' claims. The trial court declared that Juan Santiago was well within his rights as a co-owner when he sold 10,926 square meters of the co-owned lot. Petitioners have no reason to complain or impugn the sale. Despite the allegations of forgery, the Ongs have in their favor the presumption of good faith in buying a portion of the co-owned lot. Vicente Ong's testimony that the late Juan Santiago's representatives carried out the documentation and registration of the property remained uncontradicted. The trial court decreed that TCT No. 213216(M) issued in the names of Juan and Jose Santiago has no legal basis. Petitioners are thus entitled to 15,000 square meters, more or less, or one-half of the 31,853 square meters of the subject property.\n\nThe dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:\n\nDeclaring the Deed of Sale dated May 26, 1992 executed by the deceased Juan Santiago in favor of Mark Vincent L. Ong involving 10,926 square meters of the community property valid;\n\nDeclaring T.C.T. No. 213125(M) issued in the name of Mark Vincent L. Ong valid;\n\nDeclaring, as null and void, T.C.T. No. T-213216(M) issued in the name of Juan Santiago and Jose Santiago covering an area of 20,927 square meters of the disputed property;\n\nDirecting the parties to sit down and effectuate a partition of the property in question in accordance with this decision; and\n\nOrdering the Register of Deeds of Meycauayan, Bulacan to cancel T.C.T. No. 213216(M) and issue in lieu thereof a new Transfer Certificate of Title in the name of Juan Santiago and Jose Santiago specifying their respective share in accordance with this decision.\nNo pronouncement as to cost\n\nSO ORDERED. [5]\n\nThe Ruling of the Appellate Court\n\nIn its Decision promulgated on 14 November 2003, the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The appellate court declared that Juan Santiago's sale of an undivided portion consisting of 10,926 square meters of co-owned property remains valid. Petitioners are not the real parties in interest possessing the character of a contracting party, or of heirs or assigns of the vendor. Only the estate of Juan Santiago, to the exclusion of petitioners, stands to be benefited or injured by the decision in the present case. There is a lack of convincing and credible proof to support the allegations of fraud with respect to the Absolute Deed of Sale and the Affidavit of Non-Tenancy. There is also an absence of satisfactory evidence to dispute the apparent irregularity on the signatures of Juan and Jose Santiago on the subdivision, consolidation and partition agreement.\n\nThe Issues\n\nPetitioners insist that they are the real parties in interest to bring the instant suit and that they have a cause of action against the respondents. Furthermore, petitioners assert that the Deed of Absolute Sale is void. Finally, the partition of the remaining portion of the lot cannot be done in accordance with the trial court's decision.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe petition has no merit.\n\nWe see no reason to overturn the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts. Therefore, we do not divert from their rulings.\n\nPetitioners are not real parties in interest and therefore have no cause of action in bringing the present case. A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. [6] A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another. [7] In the present case, there is no dispute that Juan Santiago owned half of the subject lot while the other half belonged to his brother Jose. Juan Santiago merely exercised his right when he sold a portion of his undivided half to Mark Vincent L. Ong. Petitioners question Juan's transaction even though petitioners are neither parties to the contract nor heirs or assigns of Juan Santiago. [8] Juan Santiago left a probated will leaving all his properties to his wife Aurea, to the exclusion of petitioners. As heirs of Jose Santiago, co-owner of the subject property, petitioners may only question the sale if their right of preemption under the Civil Code of the Philippines [9] was disregarded, and they wish to exercise such right. However, petitioners do not seek to exercise the right of preemption. Thus, they are not real parties in interest in the present case.\n\nWe likewise affirm the lower courts' ruling on the validity of the Deed of Sale, even though petitioners have no personality to question the same before this Court. Apart from their allegations, petitioners failed to prove that Juan Santiago was incapacitated to contract at the time of the execution of the Deed of Sale.\n\nFinally, we affirm the lower courts' ruling that TCT No. 213216(M) issued in the names of Jose and Juan Santiago be nullified and a new one issued to reflect the shares in the remaining portions of the subject property. The estate of Juan Santiago can only claim 5,000 square meters, more or less, of the remaining 20,927 square meters of the subject property.\n\nWHEREFORE , we DENY the petition. We AFFIRM the Decision promulgated on 14 November 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 66048.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nPuno, C.J., (Chairperson), Corona, Leonardo-De Castro, and Bersamin, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 81-94.

The heir is not liable beyond the value of the property he received from the decedent.\n\nIf a contract should contain some stipulation in favor of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment provided he communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its revocation. A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person is not sufficient. The contracting parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.\n\n[9] Article 1623 of the Civil Codes provides:\n\nThe right of legal preemption or redemption shall not be exercised except within thirty days from the notice in writing by the prospective vendor, or by the vendor, as the case may be. The deed of sale shall not be recorded in the Registry of Property unless accompanied by an affidavit of the vendor that he has given written notice thereof to all possible redemptioners.\n\nThe right of redemption of co-owners excludes that of adjoining owners.\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

D E C I S I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseThis is a petition for review[1] assailing the Amended Decision[2] promulgated on 30 January 2004 of the Court of Appeals (appellate court) in CA-G.R. CV No. 56623. The appellate court affirmed the Resolution[3] dated 14 February 1997 of Branch 225, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (trial court) in Civil Case No. Q-96-27837 which dismissed the complaint of petitioner Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation (Cecilleville) against respondent spouses Tito and Ofelia Acu\u00f1a (Acu\u00f1a spouses) on the ground of prescription.The FactsThe trial court summarized the facts of the case as follows:Sometime in September 1981, the defendants [Acu\u00f1a spouses] requested the plaintiff [Cecilleville] thru its President, Jose A. Resurreccion, to lend to them for one (1) year, two (2) parcels of land owned by the plaintiff as collaterals to secure a credit line from the Prudential Bank and Trust Company [\"Prudential\"]. On September 21, 1981, thru a secretary's certificate and by virtue of a board resolution, the plaintiff lent to defendants the said owner's copies of certificate of title. However, on September 28, 1991, defendant Ofelia B. Acu\u00f1a forged the signature of Lucia R. Reyes as corporate secretary. By virtue of the fake secretary's certificate, the defendants were able to obtain a personal loan from \"Prudential\" in the sum of P610,000.00 with said certificates as collaterals and upon signing a Real Estate Mortgage dated September 30, 1981 and two Promissory Notes dated October 7, 1981 and October 15, 1981. Due to the defendants' default in the payment of their indebtedness, \"Prudential\" threatened to extrajudicially foreclose the real estate mortgage on plaintiff's properties thru a notice of auction sale. To avoid foreclosure proceedings on its properties, the plaintiff was forced to settle defendants' obligations to \"Prudential\" in the amount of P3,367,474.42. Subsequently, several written demands for reimbursement were sent by the plaintiff to the defendants. Nevertheless, the defendants failed to pay their obligation. Hence, the filing of the instant case.In their motion, defendants contend that the instant complaint should be dismissed on the grounds of prescription, laches and res judicata. The defendants insist that the action of the plaintiff is based on fraud or forgery of a secretary's certificate. The forgery allegedly happened on September 28, 1981 or fifteen (15) years ago. Therefore, the plaintiff should have brought the instant action within the period provided for in Article 1146 of the Civil Code. Moreover, the defendants argue that the plaintiff's inordinate delay in the filing of the instant suit clearly shows that it has abandoned its claim against the defendants and therefore guilty of laches. Consequently, the defendants aver that the forgery issue has been passed upon in CA-G.R. CV No. 35452. The same was litigated in Civil Case No. Q-59789, Branch 78, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City \"where the plaintiff tried unsuccessfully to have the contract of real estate mortgage involving the same properties, between defendant Ofelia Acu\u00f1a and the Prudential Bank and Trust Company, annulled on the same ground raised here.\" Hence, the principle of res judicata applies.[4]This Court, in its resolution in G.R. No. 109488, affirmed the appellate court's decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 35452 that Cecilleville ratified the mortgage contract between the Acu\u00f1a spouses and Prudential. The dispositive portion of the decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 35452 reads:WHEREFORE, the appeal of appellant Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation should be, as it is hereby, DISMISSED. Finding merit to the appeal of Prudential Bank & Trust Company, the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued by the trial court is hereby LIFTED, and appellant Bank can now proceed with the foreclosure proceedings of the mortgaged properties.As a corollary thereto, appellant Cecilleville is hereby ordered to pay appellant Prudential Bank the interests, penalty and service charges stipulated in the promissory notes secured by the mortgage, accruing from the time the writ of preliminary injunction was issued until the said promissory notes are fully paid. No costs.SO ORDERED.[5]After Cecilleville paid Prudential, Cecilleville filed the present action to claim reimbursement from the Acu\u00f1a spouses.The Ruling of the Trial CourtIn its Resolution dated 14 February 1997, the trial court dismissed Cecilleville's complaint on the ground of prescription. The trial court found that the complaint expressly alleged that Cecilleville discovered the fraud on 28 September 1981. Therefore, Cecilleville had only four years from discovery of the fraud within which to file the appropriate action. The present action was filed on 20 June 1996, clearly beyond the prescriptive period.The Ruling of the Appellate CourtCecilleville lodged an appeal before the appellate court. In its Decision promulgated on 14 January 2003, the appellate court reversed and set aside the trial court's ruling and decided in favor of Cecilleville. The appellate court stated that Cecilleville has two causes of action against the Acu\u00f1a spouses: reimbursement of a sum of money and damages arising from fraud. Cecilleville's action for reimbursement was filed on 20 June 1996, barely two months after 23 April 1996, when Cecilleville made an extrajudicial demand to pay. Two months is well within the five-year prescriptive period prescribed in Article 1149 of the Civil Code. On the other hand, the appellate court declared that the complaint did not mention the date of Cecilleville's discovery of Ofelia Acu\u00f1a's forgery of Lucia Reyes' signature. The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in declaring Cecilleville's claim for damages barred by prescription and laches. The appellate court also declared that there is no identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action between the present case and that of G.R. No. 109488 between Cecilleville and Prudential. Hence, the principle of res judicata does not apply.The dispositive portion of the appellate court's 14 January 2003 Decision reads:WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is GRANTED and the assailed resolution of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 225, in Civil Case No. Q-96-27837 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Let this case be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.SO ORDERED.[6]On motion for reconsideration filed by the Acu\u00f1a spouses, the appellate court promulgated an amended decision on 30 January 2004 which affirmed the trial court's decision. The appellate court ruled that Cecilleville's claim for reimbursement of its payment to Prudential is predicated on the fraud allegedly committed by the Acu\u00f1a spouses. Without the alleged personal loan of the Acu\u00f1a spouses, there would be no foreclosure to forestall and no basis for Cecilleville's claim for reimbursement. Actions for relief on the ground of fraud may be brought within four years from discovery of the fraud. In its brief filed before the appellate court, Cecilleville stated that it learned of the existence of the falsified Secretary's Certificate on 20 January 1987. Cecilleville filed the present case on 20 June 1996, or more than nine years after the discovery of the fraud. Thus, Cecilleville's action is barred by prescription. The dispositive portion of the appellate court's amended decision reads:WHEREFORE, the instant motion for reconsideration is GRANTED. The decision, dated 14 January 2003, of this Court is accordingly, RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE. The assailed resolution, dated 14 February 1997, of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 225, in Civil Case No. Q-96-27837, is hereby AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.[7]The IssuesCecilleville mentions two grounds in its appeal before this Court. First, the appellate court gravely erred because its amended decision is premised on a misapprehension of facts. Cecilleville alleges that its claim for reimbursement is not based on fraud but on a ratified third-party real estate mortgage contract to accommodate the Acu\u00f1a spouses. Second, the appellate court's amended decision is not in accord with law or with this Court's decisions. Cecilleville theorizes that its ratification extinguished the action to annul the real estate mortgage and made the real estate mortgage valid and enforceable. Thus, Cecilleville demands reimbursement on the basis of a ratified real estate mortgage.The Ruling of the CourtWe see merit in the petition.The facts of the case are simple: The Acu\u00f1a spouses obtained a loan from Prudential secured by a real estate mortgage on Cecilleville's property. The Acu\u00f1a spouses defaulted on their loan, and Prudential initiated foreclosure proceedings. Cecilleville tried to annul the real estate mortgage but failed when the Court ruled that Cecilleville had ratified the real estate mortgage. In effect, Cecilleville became a third-party accommodation mortgagor. Cecilleville paid Prudential to avoid foreclosure of its mortgaged properties. Cecilleville repeatedly asked the Acu\u00f1a spouses to reimburse what it paid Prudential, but the Acu\u00f1a spouses refused to do so.From the facts above, we see that Cecilleville paid the debt of the Acu\u00f1a spouses to Prudential as an interested third party. The second paragraph of Article 1236 of the Civil Code reads:Whoever pays for another may demand from the debtor what he has paid, except that if he paid without the knowledge or against the will of the debtor, he can recover only insofar as the payment has been beneficial to the debtor.Even if the Acu\u00f1a spouses insist that Cecilleville's payment to Prudential was without their knowledge or against their will, Article 1302(3) of the Civil Code states that Cecilleville still has a right to reimbursement, thus:When, even without the knowledge of the debtor, a person interested in the fulfillment of the obligation pays, without prejudice to the effects of confusion as to the latter's share.Cecilleville clearly has an interest in the fulfillment of the obligation because it owns the properties mortgaged to secure the Acu\u00f1a spouses' loan. When an interested party pays the obligation, he is subrogated in the rights of the creditor.[8] Because of its payment of the Acu\u00f1a spouses' loan, Cecilleville actually steps into the shoes of Prudential and becomes entitled, not only to recover what it has paid, but also to exercise all the rights which Prudential could have exercised. There is, in such cases, not a real extinguishment of the obligation, but a change in the active subject.[9]Cecilleville's cause of action against the Acu\u00f1a spouses is one created by law; hence, the action prescribes in ten years.[10] Prescription accrues from the date of payment by Cecilleville to Prudential of the Acu\u00f1a spouses' debt on 5 April 1994. Cecilleville's present complaint against the Acu\u00f1a spouses was filed on 20 June 1996, which was almost two months from the extrajudicial demands to pay on 9 and 23 April 1996. Whether we use the date of payment, the date of the last written demand for payment, or the date of judicial demand, it is clear that Cecilleville's cause of action has not yet prescribed.Finally, considering the length of time of litigation and the fact that the records of the case are before this Court, we deem it prudent to declare the Acu\u00f1a spouses' liability to Cecilleville in the following amounts:a. P3,367,474.42, representing the amount paid by Cecilleville to Prudential; andb. interest on the P3,367,474.42 at 16% per annum, this being the interest rate upon default on the promissory note to Prudential to which Cecilleville is subrogated. Interest shall be calculated from 9 April 1996, the date of Cecilleville's first written demand to the Acu\u00f1a spouses after its payment to Prudential.The Acu\u00f1a spouses shall also pay attorney's fees to Cecilleville equivalent to 5% of the total award.[11]WHEREFORE, we GRANT the petition. We SET ASIDE the Amended Decision promulgated on 30 January 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 56623. Respondent spouses Tito Acu\u00f1a and Ofelia B. Acu\u00f1a shall pay petitioner Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation the following: P3,367,474.42, representing the amount paid by Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation to Prudential Bank and Trust Company; and interest on the P3,367,474.42 at 16% per annum. Interest shall be calculated from 9 April 1996 until full payment. Spouses Tito Acu\u00f1a and Ofelia B. Acu\u00f1a shall also pay attorney's fees to Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation equivalent to 5% of the total award.

Cecilleville's action for reimbursement was filed on 20 June 1996, barely two months after 23 April 1996, when Cecilleville made an extrajudicial demand to pay. Two months is well within the five-year prescriptive period prescribed in Article 1149 of the Civil Code. On the other hand, the appellate court declared that the complaint did not mention the date of Cecilleville's discovery of Ofelia Acu\u00f1a's forgery of Lucia Reyes' signature. The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in declaring Cecilleville's claim for damages barred by prescription and laches. The appellate court also declared that there is no identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action between the present case and that of G.R. No. 109488 between Cecilleville and Prudential. Hence, the principle of res judicata does not apply.\n\nThe dispositive portion of the appellate court's 14 January 2003 Decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant appeal is GRANTED and the assailed resolution of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 225, in Civil Case No. Q-96-27837 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Let this case be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6]\nOn motion for reconsideration filed by the Acu\u00f1a spouses, the appellate court promulgated an amended decision on 30 January 2004 which affirmed the trial court's decision. The appellate court ruled that Cecilleville's claim for reimbursement of its payment to Prudential is predicated on the fraud allegedly committed by the Acu\u00f1a spouses. Without the alleged personal loan of the Acu\u00f1a spouses, there would be no foreclosure to forestall and no basis for Cecilleville's claim for reimbursement. Actions for relief on the ground of fraud may be brought within four years from discovery of the fraud. In its brief filed before the appellate court, Cecilleville stated that it learned of the existence of the falsified Secretary's Certificate on 20 January 1987. Cecilleville filed the present case on 20 June 1996, or more than nine years after the discovery of the fraud. Thus, Cecilleville's action is barred by prescription. The dispositive portion of the appellate court's amended decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant motion for reconsideration is GRANTED. The decision, dated 14 January 2003, of this Court is accordingly, RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE. The assailed resolution, dated 14 February 1997, of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 225, in Civil Case No. Q-96-27837, is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7]\n\nThe Issues\n\nCecilleville mentions two grounds in its appeal before this Court. First, the appellate court gravely erred because its amended decision is premised on a misapprehension of facts. Cecilleville alleges that its claim for reimbursement is not based on fraud but on a ratified third-party real estate mortgage contract to accommodate the Acu\u00f1a spouses. Second, the appellate court's amended decision is not in accord with law or with this Court's decisions. Cecilleville theorizes that its ratification extinguished the action to annul the real estate mortgage and made the real estate mortgage valid and enforceable. Thus, Cecilleville demands reimbursement on the basis of a ratified real estate mortgage.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nWe see merit in the petition.\n\nThe facts of the case are simple: The Acu\u00f1a spouses obtained a loan from Prudential secured by a real estate mortgage on Cecilleville's property. The Acu\u00f1a spouses defaulted on their loan, and Prudential initiated foreclosure proceedings. Cecilleville tried to annul the real estate mortgage but failed when the Court ruled that Cecilleville had ratified the real estate mortgage. In effect, Cecilleville became a third-party accommodation mortgagor. Cecilleville paid Prudential to avoid foreclosure of its mortgaged properties. Cecilleville repeatedly asked the Acu\u00f1a spouses to reimburse what it paid Prudential, but the Acu\u00f1a spouses refused to do so.\n\nFrom the facts above, we see that Cecilleville paid the debt of the Acu\u00f1a spouses to Prudential as an interested third party. The second paragraph of Article 1236 of the Civil Code reads:\n\nWhoever pays for another may demand from the debtor what he has paid, except that if he paid without the knowledge or against the will of the debtor, he can recover only insofar as the payment has been beneficial to the debtor.\nEven if the Acu\u00f1a spouses insist that Cecilleville's payment to Prudential was without their knowledge or against their will, Article 1302(3) of the Civil Code states that Cecilleville still has a right to reimbursement, thus:\n\nWhen, even without the knowledge of the debtor, a person interested in the fulfillment of the obligation pays, without prejudice to the effects of confusion as to the latter's share.\nCecilleville clearly has an interest in the fulfillment of the obligation because it owns the properties mortgaged to secure the Acu\u00f1a spouses' loan. When an interested party pays the obligation, he is subrogated in the rights of the creditor. [8] Because of its payment of the Acu\u00f1a spouses' loan, Cecilleville actually steps into the shoes of Prudential and becomes entitled, not only to recover what it has paid, but also to exercise all the rights which Prudential could have exercised. There is, in such cases, not a real extinguishment of the obligation, but a change in the active subject. [9]\n\nCecilleville's cause of action against the Acu\u00f1a spouses is one created by law; hence, the action prescribes in ten years. [10] Prescription accrues from the date of payment by Cecilleville to Prudential of the Acu\u00f1a spouses' debt on 5 April 1994. Cecilleville's present complaint against the Acu\u00f1a spouses was filed on 20 June 1996, which was almost two months from the extrajudicial demands to pay on 9 and 23 April 1996. Whether we use the date of payment, the date of the last written demand for payment, or the date of judicial demand, it is clear that Cecilleville's cause of action has not yet prescribed.\n\nFinally, considering the length of time of litigation and the fact that the records of the case are before this Court, we deem it prudent to declare the Acu\u00f1a spouses' liability to Cecilleville in the following amounts:\n\na. P3,367,474.42, representing the amount paid by Cecilleville to Prudential; and\n\nb. interest on the P3,367,474.42 at 16% per annum , this being the interest rate upon default on the promissory note to Prudential to which Cecilleville is subrogated. Interest shall be calculated from 9 April 1996, the date of Cecilleville's first written demand to the Acu\u00f1a spouses after its payment to Prudential.\n\nThe Acu\u00f1a spouses shall also pay attorney's fees to Cecilleville equivalent to 5% of the total award. [11]\n\nWHEREFORE , we GRANT the petition. We SET ASIDE the Amended Decision promulgated on 30 January 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 56623. Respondent spouses Tito Acu\u00f1a and Ofelia B. Acu\u00f1a shall pay petitioner Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation the following: P3,367,474.42, representing the amount paid by Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation to Prudential Bank and Trust Company; and interest on the P3,367,474.42 at 16% per annum . Interest shall be calculated from 9 April 1996 until full payment. Spouses Tito Acu\u00f1a and Ofelia B.

      "title": "Now, not only was the assumption improperly made, but worse, its implementation was also gravely abused by the then Secretary of Labor. It may be well to note that in the first assailed Order dated 30 July 1997, the Petitioner was found guilty of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal, a finding that was arrived at by then Secretary Quisumbing without observing the measure of due process demanded by the gravity of the charges made against MMC x x x. For all its efforts, the Petitioner should have, at the very least, been spared of these whimsical and arbitrary impositions of the Public Respondent and his predecessor in office (referring to Secretary Quisumbing) x x x.The foregoing portion of the petition amply suggests that petitioner was assailing the Quisumbing order, not only on the issues of reinstatement and the award of wage increase, but also on the matter of unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal and the award of backwages as well. Assuming arguendo that indeed the issues on unfair labor practice and award of backwages were not raised by petitioner, there is nothing to prevent this Court from reviewing matters not specifically raised or assigned as error by the parties, if their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just resolution of the controversy, as in the instant case. Thus we held: x x x It is axiomatic that an appeal, once accepted by this Court, throws the entire case open to review, and that this Court has the authority to review matters not specifically raised or assigned as error by the parties, if their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just resolution of the case.[11]In upholding the Quisumbing order over the Trajano order, we resolved:[12]Indeed, the timing of the retrenchment of workers tends to confirm the finding of the Secretary of Labor that the cessation of operations on October 7, 1996 was an illegal lock-out. It is noteworthy that Petitioner claimed business losses to justify the retrenchment of workers at the time when the parties were negotiating a new CBA.Considering that he found Petitioner to be guilty of unfair labor practice in bargaining in bad faith, the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and the grant of wage increase were proper.It must be noted that the Trajano order omitted the findings of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal and the award of backwages which were embodied in the Quisumbing order. Since we upheld entirely the findings in the Quisumbing order, i.e., illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, award of backwages, reinstatement and wage increase in our Resolution, as a result the Trajano order is necessarily vacated. Furthermore, the dispositive portion could not have been clearer as it categorically declares that the Secretary of Labor, i.e., Leonardo Quisumbing, did not commit grave abuse in his order dated 30 July 1997, thus: WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is DISMISSED for lack of showing that the Secretary of Labor and Employment committed grave abuse of discretion in his order of July 30, 1997.The order that we sustained in the foregoing fallo is the Quisumbing order which is dated 30 July 1997, and definitely not the Trajano order which is dated 17 April 1998. Even if we did not explicitly annul the Trajano order, nevertheless the tenor of the Resolution's dispositive portion indubitably decreed that we sustained the order dated 30 July 1997 or the Quisumbing order. Indeed, it is the dispositive part of the judgment that actually settles and declares the rights and obligations of the parties, finally, definitively, authoritatively, notwithstanding the existence of inconsistent statements in the body that may tend to confuse.[13] It is the dispositive part that controls, for purposes of execution.[14] Hence, there is no doubt that it was the Quisumbing order, not the Trajano order, that we upheld in our Resolution and which should be the basis of the writ of execution. As to petitioner's contention that NAMAWU allegedly admitted in its Motion for Partial Execution dated 11 September 1998 the validity and finality the Trajano order, the same is unsubstantiated. It does not appear from the said motion that NAMAWU made such categorical admission. Besides, even if there was such an admission, the same does not bind this Court. It is not the interpretation of NAMAWU that makes the Trajano order or the Quisumbing order controlling, rather, it is the Court's declaration that settles such issue. Anent the second issue, petitioner questions the BWC computation. It accentuates that the same is flawed as it included the award of backwages which was already deleted in the Trajano order. Petitioner also insists that the Abuana case \u2013 where the dismissal of Abuana was declared valid, and therefore the award of backwages was deleted by the labor arbiter and later affirmed by the NLRC - should have a bearing in the instant case considering that the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of Abuana are the same circumstances that resulted in the retrenchments of NAMAWU's members in May and October 1996. As Abuana was not awarded backwages, NAMAWU's members should not have been awarded backwages as well.Petitioner likewise avers that the employees who were not retrenched in May and October 1996 should not be awarded the wage increase because of subsequent and supervening events such as the fact that these employees had entered into separate agreements with petitioner for the adoption of a new progressive wage system and that they executed quitclaims releasing petitioner from any liabilities. According to petitioner, another reason why the wage increase cannot be availed of by the employees not retrenched in May and October 1996, is because the NAMAWU and petitioner have yet to enter into a collective bargaining as required by the Quisumbing order. It is petitioner's interpretation of the said order that prior to the implementation of the wage increase, a CBA must first be constituted. On the other hand, the Court of Appeals opined that the Quisumbing order, and not the Trajano order, is controlling and should be the basis of the issuance of the writ of execution. As to the Abuana case, the appellate court ruled that the same cannot prevail over the Quisumbing order, the latter having been affirmed both by the Court of Appeals and this Court. The Court of Appeals added that the decision in Abuana cannot bind the parties in the instant case since they are not involved in the said Abuana case. Addressing the matter on the execution of quitclaims, the Court of Appeals discredited the same on the grounds that the copies of the same were not presented, and that granting that they were indeed executed, the same cannot bar the execution of the Quisumbing order in the absence of any showing that the entire amount due the employees was fully satisfied with the execution of the quitclaims. It ruled that the wage increase embodied in the BWC computation does not refer to the agreed wage increase that can only be implemented after a CBA is reached by the parties, rather, it refers to the across-the-board increase granted in the Quisumbing order as a result of a finding of unfair labor practice on the part of petitioner due to its failure to observe its duty to bargain. Thus, the wage increase as computed by the BWC, is legally in order even in the absence of a new CBA. We agree with the Court of Appeals. Petitioner's assertion that there is no basis for the computation of backwages, because the backwages awarded in the Quisumbing order was deleted in the Trajano order flounders in view of our declaration that the Quisumbing order sets aside the Trajano order. The Court of Appeals is correct in saying that the pronouncement in the Abuana case is not binding on the parties in this case. We further state that the Abuana case does not affect NAMAWU no matter the similarity in situation is on the ground that NAMAWU was not impleaded as a party in the Abuana case. It is a basic postulate in this jurisdiction that \"no man shall be affected [in] any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by any judgment rendered by the court.\"[15] Due process requires that a court decision can only bind a party therein and not against one who did not have his day in court. As to petitioner's argument on the new progressive wage, suffice it to state that the same issue had already been passed upon in Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Trajano[16] where we affirmed the finding of the Court of Appeals, viz:[17]The alleged acceptance of the workers of the new wage structure is likewise unreliable. If the alternative is dismissal, who would not sign an \"acceptance\" of such new wage structure? Besides, as pointed out by the private respondent, even granting that the workers freely agreed to such wage structures, the company could not have validly negotiated with them without violating the Labor Code, considering that the private respondent was still then the exclusive bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees.Petitioner's contention that the workers whose services were terminated subsequent in May and October 1996 executed quitclaims does not merit our attention because petitioner failed to prove such execution. Quitclaims are commonly frowned upon as contrary to public policy and ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of the workers' legal rights especially if the following are present: (a) there is clear proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person; or (b) the terms of the settlement are unconscionable, and on their face invalid, such quitclaims must be struck down as invalid or illegal.[18] In the instant case, the execution of the alleged quitclaims appears to be suspect because of the illegal dismissal of the workers and the unfair labor practice committed by petitioner. For fear of getting nothing from petitioner, it may be readily concluded that employees were compelled to sign the quitclaims. Also, petitioner failed to present evidence to show that payments to the workers were made. Equally unavailing is petitioner's assertion that the wage increase or adjustment adopted under the BWC computation is premature since no CBA had been entered into. As accurately explained by the appellate court:[19]Neither can We subscribe to petitioner's contention that the wage adjustment or increase adopted in the BWC computation cannot be implemented in the absence of a new CBA. It is undisputed that the increase adverted to in the BWC computation does not refer to the agreed wage increase that could only be implemented based on a new CBA. Rather, it refers to the across-the-board increase granted in the Quisumbing order as a consequence of a finding of unfair labor practice on the part of MMC due to its failure to observe its duty to bargain.Anent the third issue, petitioner argues that NAMAWU had no legal standing to seek the implementation of the assailed orders of DOLE Acting Secretary Brion because of the disaffiliation of the majority of its members which deprived NAMAWU's authority to represent its members. Article 256 of the Labor Code partly provides: REPRESENTATION ISSUE IN ORGANIZED ESTABLISHMENTS. \u2013 In organized establishments, when a verified petition questioning the majority status of the incumbent bargaining agent is filed before the Department of Labor and Employment within the sixty-day period before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, the Med-Arbiter shall automatically order an election by secret ballot when the verified petition is supported by the written consent of at least twenty-five (25%) percent of all the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit. x x x x At the expiration of the freedom period, the employer shall continue to recognize the majority status of the incumbent bargaining agent where no petition for certification election is filed.According to the foregoing provision, for a union to become an exclusive bargaining representative of a particular establishment, it must emerge as winner in a certification election. In the case at bar, there was no certification election held challenging the majority status of NAMAWU as the exclusive bargaining representative of petitioner's employees. NAMAWU, therefore, remains the exclusive bargaining representative of petitioner's employees and possesses legal standing to represent them. One final point. NAMAWU accuses petitioner of forum shopping. NAMAWU alleges that the instant petition is filed for the purpose of preventing the execution of the Quisumbing order as affirmed by this Court on 06 July 1998 in G.R. No. 133519 and on 26 January 2000 in G.R. No. 138996. Petitioner counters that it did not commit forum shopping because the relief prayed for in the previous case was the reversal of the Trajano order while the relief prayed for in this petition is the reversal of the orders enforcing and executing the terms of the Quisumbing order. Forum shopping exists when a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in, or already resolved adversely, by some other court.[20] It has been characterized as an act of malpractice that is prohibited and condemned as trifling with the courts and abusing their processes. The test in determining whether a party violates the rule against forum shopping is where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in the action under consideration or where the elements of litis pendentia are present. In turn, the elements of res judicata as enumerated in Sy Kao v. Court of Appeals[21] are as follows: (a) identity of parties; (b) identity of rights asserted and reliefs being founded on the same facts; and (c) identity in the two preceding particulars should be such that any judgment which may be rendered on the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration. In this case, the parties are the same, petitioner and NAMAWU. The reliefs prayed for are substantially identical which is ultimately the nullification of the Quisumbing order. Likewise, res judicata[22] exists because a ruling of this Court on the issues raised by petitioner would amount to revisiting and re-ventilating the essentially same issue, i.e., whether or not the Quisumbing order is controlling, which were already passed upon and definitely resolved by this Court in Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Trajano.[23] Even on this ground alone, for being violative of the rule against forum shopping, the instant petition for review should be denied.[24] WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 24 January 2002 and its Resolution dated 18 March 2003 are hereby AFFIRMED. With costs. SO ORDERED.

Brion,\u00a0 et al. ,\" respectively, and the Resolution dated 18 March 2003 denying petitioner\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds motion for reconsideration.\n\nPetitioner Maricalum Mining Corporation (MMC) is a domestic corporation engaged in mining business and operation, while private respondent National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103 (NAMAWU) is the exclusive bargaining agent of the rank and file employees of petitioner.\n\nOn 29 January 1996, NAMAWU submitted its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) proposals to petitioner.\u00a0 Due to petitioner's inaction to the proposals submitted by NAMAWU, the latter filed on 19 March 1996, its first Notice of Strike with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB), Bacolod City, for refusal to bargain and Unfair Labor Practice.\n\nEventually, petitioner presented its counter-proposals and started the CBA negotiations.\u00a0 While the negotiations were going on, petitioner dismissed some workers effective 06 May 1996.\n\nOn 23 August 1996, NAMAWU filed a second Notice of Strike for Unfair Labor Practice against petitioner.\n\nOn 05 September 1996, while the NCMB Bacolod City was conducting conciliation meetings, petitioner issued Notices of Temporary Lay-off to its selected rank and file employees effective 07 October 1996.\n\nAfter the NCMB failed to conciliate the labor dispute between NAMAWU and petitioner, then Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing, [2] on 03 October 1996, assumed jurisdiction over the case docketed as OS-AJ-10-96-014 (NCMB-RB6-08-06-96).\n\nMeanwhile, Pedro M. Abuana, Jr., an adversely affected employee of petitioner during the retrenchment effected on 07 October 1996, filed, in his own behalf, an illegal dismissal case against the petitioner before the Regional Arbitration Branch No. VI, National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) docketed as RAB Case No. 06-12-10636-96 (Abuana case).\u00a0 The Labor Arbiter ruled that the dismissal of Abuana was legal and valid. [3] On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter, which decision became final and executory. [4]\n\nIn an order dated 30 July 1997 (Quisumbing order), Secretary Quisumbing\u00a0 resolved the labor dispute in favor of NAMAWU: (1) directing the reinstatement with backwages of the workers laid-off in May and October 1996; (2) finding petitioner guilty of illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice; (3) directing the parties to enter into a collective bargaining agreement incorporating all the terms and conditions of the previous bargaining agreement; and (4) providing for across-the-board increase of all rank-and-file workers.\u00a0 The dispositive portion reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:\nDeclaring that lay-offs implemented on May 7, 1996 and October 7, 1996 as illegal:\nOrdering that all workers, whether union members or not, who were laid-off on May 7, 1996 and October 7, 1996 be immediately reinstated without gap in service, loss of seniority, and that their full backwages and benefits from the time of termination until actual reinstatement be paid;\nDeclaring the Company to have violated the Labor Code provisions on Unfair Labor Practice for negotiating in bad faith and later refusing to negotiate; and\nOrdering the parties to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement incorporating all the terms and conditions of the previous collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the NFL, except the name of the exclusive bargaining agent, and providing for an annual across-the-board increase in the daily wage of all rank and file workers in the amount of P60.00 per day from February, 1995 until January, 1998 and another P50.00 increase annually effective February 1, 1998 until January 31, 2000.\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which was granted by succeeding DOLE Secretary Cresenciano Trajano in an order dated 17 April 1998 (Trajano order).\u00a0 The Trajano order modified the Quisumbing order as follows: (1) setting aside the finding of illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice and remanding these issues to the arbitration level of the NLRC for a hearing on the merits; and (2) deleting the award of backwages for the workers to be reinstated. The pertinent portions of the Trajano order state:\nThis Office finds that there are no new matters/evidence in the Motion for Reconsideration which would warrant a reversal of Our decision on wage issue.\n\nWe however find it necessary, in the interest of justice and fairness, to reconsider Our finding of Unfair Labor Practice which could ultimately subject the Company and its officers to criminal prosecution.\n\nx x x x\n\nThis being the case, it is a matter of necessity that a full-blown hearing be conducted on the issue of unfair labor practice.\u00a0 Indeed, Art. 247 of the Labor Code, as amended, mandates that a hearing should be conducted in the resolution of an unfair labor practice.\n\nPending resolution of the issue of unfair labor practice and illegal termination, the Company is directed to physically reinstate all workers, whether union members or not who were laid-off on May 7, 1996 and October 7, 1996.\n\nWHEREFORE, except as above modified, Our Order dated 30 July 1997 is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nThe Executive Labor Arbiter, Regional Arbitration Branch No. VI, National Labor Relations Commission, is hereby deputized as Hearing Officer and is directed to conduct hearing/s and receive evidence as expeditiously as possible on the issues of unfair labor practice and terminations effected by the Company on May 7, 1996 and October 7, 1996, and to submit his Report and Recommendation to this Office within ten (10) days from termination of the hearing.\nMeanwhile, as earlier mentioned, on 30 April 1998, the Labor Arbiter handling RAB Case No. 06-12-10636-96 which was filed by Abuana ruled that the retrenchment effected by MMC on 07 May 1996 and 07 October 1996 were valid and legal. [5]\n\nDissatisfied by the Quisumbing and Trajano orders, petitioner MMC filed a petition for certiorari before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 133519 entitled, \" Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Hon. Cresenciano B. Trajano, et al.\" In a resolution dated 06 July 1998 (Resolution), this Court dismissed the petition on the ground that the then Secretary of DOLE Quisumbing did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing his order dated 30 July 1997.\n\nPetitioner moved for a reconsideration of the Resolution.\n\nOn 11 September 1998, NAMAWU filed a Motion for Partial Execution with the DOLE which was not acted upon due to the pendency of petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nDuring the pendency of petitioner's motion for reconsideration, the decision in St. Martin's Funeral Homes v. National Labor Relations Commission [6] was promulgated.\u00a0 Following the ruling in said case, petitioner's motion for reconsideration of our resolution dated 06 July 1998 was remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition.\n\nOn 14 June 1999, the appellate court denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nStill undaunted, petitioner brought the case anew to this Court via petition for review on certiorari , docketed as G.R. No. 138996 entitled, \"Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Hon Cresenciano B. Trajano, in his capacity as the Secretary of the DOLE and NAMAWU Local 103 ,\" which was, however, denied with finality in a resolution dated 26 January 2000.\n\nOn 10 February 2000, NAMAWU filed an Ex-Parte Manifestation and Second Motion for Execution with the Secretary of DOLE.\u00a0 The motion also sought assistance from the Bureau of Working Conditions (BWC) in the computation of the awards/benefits due NAMAWU's members under the Quisumbing order.\n\nOn 25 July 2000, the BWC submitted to the DOLE its findings and observation, coming up with a computation in the aggregate amount of One Hundred Fifty-Nine Million, Fifty-Four Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-One and 30/100 (P159,054,971.30) Pesos for loss of time, benefits, rice subsidy, health insurance bonus and backwages of union members who were illegally dismissed.\n\nPetitioner filed a comment to the BWC findings on 08 September 2000, stating that the BWC computation was erroneous for the following reasons: (1) there is no legal basis for the computation of backwages because the Trajano order deleted the award of backwages made in the Quisumbing order; (2) the entitlement to backwages of the employees retrenched in May and October 1996 would be dependent on the resolution of the cases for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice; and (3) the wage increase awarded by the Secretary cannot be availed of by the other employees who were not retrenched in May and October 1996.\n\nOn 18 November 2000, 149 employees of petitioner who claimed were part of the 215 members of NAMAWU filed a Motion for Intervention With Prior Leave before the Office of the Secretary of DOLE. [7]\n\nIn an order [8] dated 09 May 2001, DOLE Acting Secretary Arturo D. Brion granted NAMAWU's motion for execution, approved BWC's computation of the benefits due to the laid-off employees and denied the motion for intervention, thus:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:\nOrdering respondent MMC to immediately reinstate all workers whether union member or not, who were laid-off on May 7, 1997 and October 7, 1996 without gap in service, loss of seniority, and that their full backwages and benefits from the time of termination until actual reinstatement be paid;\nApproving the computation of BWC consisting of 23 pages based on the Order of July 30, 1997 submitted on this office on July 25, 2000 through Director Danilo S. Lorredo and made integral part thereof;\nDenying intervenor's motion for intervention; and\nOrdering the Bureau of Working Condition to compute the remaining amount of the award due to complainants as per order of the Secretary of Labor dated July 30, 1997 starting October 1, 1999 until January 31, 2000. Let a partial writ of execution be issued directing the Sheriff, Regional Office No. VI, Department of Labor and Employment, Bacolod City to proceed to the premises of Mariculum Mining Corporation to execute the Order dated July 30, 1997 affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court in the resolutions dated June 14, 1999 and July 6, 1998, respectively, and collect the aggregate amount of P159,054,971.30 whose breakdown is specified in the partial writ of execution.\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration.\u00a0 On 11 May 2001, then DOLE Acting Secretary Brion issued a Partial Writ of Execution, [9] directing to proceed to the MMC premises for the execution of the same.\u00a0 In an order dated o6 June 2001, Acting Secretary Brion denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nWith the denial of petitioner's motion, Carlos G. Nerja, Jr. and Eugenio D. Caras, who claimed to represent the 342 employees of petitioner at that time and who allegedly stand to be adversely affected by the enforcement of the Partial Writ of Execution, filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 65351.\n\nPetitioner also filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 65458.\n\nNAMAWU filed a motion for consolidation of the two petitions which was granted by the appellate court in its order dated 12 November 2001.\n\nThe Court of Appeals dispose of the two petitions by dismissing them in a Decision dated 24 January 2002.\n\nMotions for reconsiderations were filed, which the Court of Appeals denied in an order dated 18 March 2003.\n\nCarlos G. Nerja, Jr. and Eugenio D. Caras filed a petition for review before this Court which was dismissed on 09 June 2003.\n\nOn 11 April 2003, petitioner filed the instant petition for review on certiorari.\n\nIn its Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues:\nI\n\nWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT THE TRAJANO ORDER MODIFIED THE QUISUMBING ORDER AND THUS, PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN ORDERING AND ISSUING A WRIT OF EXECUTION BASED ON THE QUISUMBING ORDER.\n\nII\n\nWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED WHIMSICALLY AND CAPRICIOUSLY IN APPROVING THE COMPUTATION OF THE BUREAU OF WORKING CONDITIONS (BWC) WITHOUT GIVING ANY CONSIDERATION TO THE SUPERVENING EVENTS THAT RENDER THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE BWC COMPUTATION UNREASONABLE AND UNJUST.\n\nIII\n\nWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT NAMAWU HAD NO LEGAL STANDING TO SEEK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ASSAILED ORDERS GIVEN THAT MAJORITY OF ITS TOTAL MEMBERSHIP HAS CHOSEN TO DISAFFILIATE.\nThe petition has no merit.\n\nOn the first issue, petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the assailed orders issued by DOLE Acting Secretary Brion finding that it was the Quisumbing order that this Court upheld in G.R. No. 133519 and that the said order should be the basis for the enforcement of the writ of execution.\n\nPetitioner stresses that the Trajano order superseded and modified the Quisumbing order, hence, the basis for the issuance and enforcement of the writ of execution must be the former order.\u00a0 To support its stance, petitioner argues that when it filed the petition in G.R. No. 133519, it merely questioned the Trajano order inasmuch as the said order affirmed the Quisumbing order directing the reinstatement of the laid-off workers and the award of wage increase.\u00a0 Petitioner points out that since the only issues raised by it in G.R. No. 133519 were the reinstatement and award of wage increase, it follows that the other issues such as unfair labor practice and the award of backwages are excluded.\u00a0 Thus, the effect of the dismissal of the petition in G.R. No. 133519 was the reinstatement of the Trajano order.\n\nPetitioner also asserts that even assuming that the Resolution affirmed the Quisumbing order in its entirety without a similar pronouncement that the Trajano order was a nullity, would only mean that there were two valid and subsisting orders.\u00a0 Since the Trajano order is the later issuance, ergo, it supersedes and modifies the Quisumbing order.\n\nPetitioner further claims that NAMAWU admitted the validity, finality and enforceability of the Trajano order in its Motion for Partial Execution dated 11 September 1998.\n\nIn the petition filed by petitioner in G.R. No. 133519, the following averments appear: [10]\nNow, not only was the assumption improperly made, but worse, its implementation was also gravely abused by the then Secretary of Labor.\u00a0 It may be well to note that in the first assailed Order dated 30 July 1997, the Petitioner was found guilty of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal, a finding that was arrived at by then Secretary Quisumbing without observing the measure of due process demanded by the gravity of the charges made against MMC x x x.\n\nFor all its efforts, the Petitioner should have, at the very least, been spared of these whimsical and arbitrary impositions of the Public Respondent and his predecessor in office (referring to Secretary Quisumbing) x x x.\nThe foregoing portion of the petition amply suggests that petitioner was assailing the Quisumbing order, not only on the issues of reinstatement and the award of wage increase, but also on the matter of unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal and the award of backwages as well.\u00a0 Assuming arguendo that indeed the issues on unfair labor practice and award of backwages were not raised by petitioner, there is nothing to prevent this Court from reviewing matters not specifically raised or assigned as error by the parties, if their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just resolution of the controversy, as in the instant case.\u00a0 Thus we held:\nx x x It is axiomatic that an appeal, once accepted by this Court, throws the entire case open to review, and that this Court has the authority to review matters not specifically raised or assigned as error by the parties, if their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just resolution of the case. [11]\nIn upholding the Quisumbing order over the Trajano order, we resolved: [12]\nIndeed, the timing of the retrenchment of workers tends to confirm the finding of the Secretary of Labor that the cessation of operations on October 7, 1996 was an illegal lock-out .\u00a0 It is noteworthy that Petitioner claimed business losses to justify the retrenchment of workers at the time when the parties were negotiating a new CBA.\n\nConsidering that he found Petitioner to be guilty of unfair labor practice in bargaining in bad faith, the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and the grant of wage increase were proper.\nIt must be noted that the Trajano order omitted the findings of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal and the award of backwages which were embodied in the Quisumbing order.\u00a0 Since we upheld entirely the findings in the Quisumbing order, i.e. , illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, award of backwages, reinstatement and wage increase in our Resolution, as a result the Trajano order is necessarily vacated.\n\nFurthermore, the dispositive portion could not have been clearer as it categorically declares that the Secretary of Labor, i.e. , Leonardo Quisumbing, did not commit grave abuse in his order dated 30 July 1997, thus:\nWHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is DISMISSED for lack of showing that the Secretary of Labor and Employment committed grave abuse of discretion in his order of July 30, 1997 .\nThe order that we sustained in the foregoing fallo is the Quisumbing order which is dated 30 July 1997, and definitely not the Trajano order which is dated 17 April 1998.\u00a0 Even if we did not explicitly annul the Trajano order, nevertheless the tenor of the Resolution's dispositive portion indubitably decreed that we sustained the order dated 30 July 1997 or the Quisumbing order.\u00a0 Indeed, it is the dispositive part of the judgment that actually settles and declares the rights and obligations of the parties, finally, definitively, authoritatively, notwithstanding the existence of inconsistent statements in the body that may tend to confuse. [13] It is the dispositive part that controls, for purposes of execution. [14] Hence, there is no doubt that it was the Quisumbing order, not the Trajano order, that we upheld in our Resolution and which should be the basis of the writ of execution.\n\nAs to petitioner's contention that NAMAWU allegedly admitted in its Motion for Partial Execution dated 11 September 1998 the validity and finality the Trajano order, the same is unsubstantiated.\u00a0 It does not appear from the said motion that NAMAWU made such categorical admission.\n\nBesides, even if there was such an admission, the same does not bind this Court.\u00a0 It is not the interpretation of NAMAWU that makes the Trajano order or the Quisumbing order controlling, rather, it is the Court's declaration that settles such issue.\n\nAnent the second issue, petitioner questions the BWC computation.\u00a0 It accentuates that the same is flawed as it included the award of backwages which was already deleted in the Trajano order.\n\nPetitioner also insists that the Abuana case \u2013 where the dismissal of Abuana was declared valid, and therefore the award of backwages was deleted by the labor arbiter and later affirmed by the NLRC - should have a bearing in the instant case considering that the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of Abuana are the same circumstances that resulted in the retrenchments of NAMAWU's members in May and October 1996.\u00a0 As Abuana was not awarded backwages, NAMAWU's members should not have been awarded backwages as well.\n\nPetitioner likewise avers that the employees who were not retrenched in May and October 1996 should not be awarded the wage increase because of subsequent and supervening events such as the fact that these employees had entered into separate agreements with petitioner for the adoption of a new progressive wage system and that they executed quitclaims releasing petitioner from any liabilities.\n\nAccording to petitioner, another reason why the wage increase cannot be availed of by the employees not retrenched in May and October 1996, is because the NAMAWU and petitioner have yet to enter into a collective bargaining as required by the Quisumbing order.\u00a0 It is petitioner's interpretation of the said order that prior to the implementation of the wage increase, a CBA must first be constituted.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court of Appeals opined that the Quisumbing order, and not the Trajano order, is controlling and should be the basis of the issuance of the writ of execution.\n\nAs to the Abuana case, the appellate court ruled that the same cannot prevail over the Quisumbing order, the latter having been affirmed both by the Court of Appeals and this Court.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals added that the decision in Abuana cannot bind the parties in the instant case since they are not involved in the said Abuana case.\n\nAddressing the matter on the execution of quitclaims, the Court of Appeals discredited the same on the grounds that the copies of the same were not presented, and that granting that they were indeed executed, the same cannot bar the execution of the Quisumbing order in the absence of any showing that the entire amount due the employees was fully satisfied with the execution of the quitclaims.\n\nIt ruled that the wage increase embodied in the BWC computation does not refer to the agreed wage increase that can only be implemented after a CBA is reached by the parties, rather, it refers to the across-the-board increase granted in the Quisumbing order as a result of a finding of unfair labor practice on the part of petitioner due to its failure to observe its duty to bargain.\u00a0 Thus, the wage increase as computed by the BWC, is legally in order even in the absence of a new CBA.\n\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals.\n\nPetitioner's assertion that there is no basis for the computation of backwages, because the backwages awarded in the Quisumbing order was deleted in the Trajano order flounders in view of our declaration that the Quisumbing order sets aside the Trajano order.\n\nThe Court of Appeals is correct in saying that the pronouncement in the Abuana case is not binding on the parties in this case.\u00a0 We further state that the Abuana case does not affect NAMAWU no matter the similarity in situation is on the ground that NAMAWU was not impleaded as a party in the Abuana case.\u00a0 It is a basic postulate in this jurisdiction that \"no man shall be affected [in] any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by any judgment rendered by the court.\" [15] Due process requires that a court decision can only bind a party therein and not against one who did not have his day in court.\n\nAs to petitioner's argument on the new progressive wage, suffice it to state that the same issue had already been passed upon in Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Trajano [16] where we affirmed the finding of the Court of Appeals, viz : [17]\nThe alleged acceptance of the workers of the new wage structure is likewise unreliable.\u00a0 If the alternative is dismissal, who would not sign an \"acceptance\" of such new wage structure?\u00a0 Besides, as pointed out by the private respondent, even granting that the workers freely agreed to such wage structures, the company could not have validly negotiated with them without violating the Labor Code, considering that the private respondent was still then the exclusive bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees.\nPetitioner's contention that the workers whose services were terminated subsequent in May and October 1996 executed quitclaims does not merit our attention because petitioner failed to prove such execution.\n\nQuitclaims are commonly frowned upon as contrary to public policy and ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of the workers' legal rights especially if the following are present: (a) there is clear proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person; or (b) the terms of the settlement are unconscionable, and on their face invalid, such quitclaims must be struck down as invalid or illegal. [18] In the instant case, the execution of the alleged quitclaims appears to be suspect because of the illegal dismissal of the workers and the unfair labor practice committed by petitioner.\u00a0 For fear of getting nothing from petitioner, it may be readily concluded that employees were compelled to sign the quitclaims.\u00a0 Also, petitioner failed to present evidence to show that payments to the workers were made.\n\nEqually unavailing is petitioner's assertion that the wage increase or adjustment adopted under the BWC computation is premature since no CBA had been entered into.\n\nAs accurately explained by the appellate court: [19]\nNeither can We subscribe to petitioner's contention that the wage adjustment or increase adopted in the BWC computation cannot be implemented in the absence of a new CBA.\u00a0 It is undisputed that the increase adverted to in the BWC computation does not refer to the agreed wage increase that could only be implemented based on a new CBA.\u00a0 Rather, it refers to the across-the-board increase granted in the Quisumbing order as a consequence of a finding of unfair labor practice on the part of MMC due to its failure to observe its duty to bargain.\nAnent the third issue, petitioner argues that NAMAWU had no legal standing to seek the implementation of the assailed orders of DOLE Acting Secretary Brion because of the disaffiliation of the majority of its members which deprived NAMAWU's authority to represent its members.\n\nArticle 256 of the Labor Code partly provides:\nREPRESENTATION ISSUE IN ORGANIZED ESTABLISHMENTS. \u2013 In organized establishments, when a verified petition questioning the majority status of the incumbent bargaining agent is filed before the Department of Labor and Employment within the sixty-day period before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, the Med-Arbiter shall automatically order an election by secret ballot\u00a0 when the verified petition is supported by the written consent of at least twenty-five (25%) percent of all the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit.\n\nx x x x\n\nAt the expiration of the freedom period, the employer shall continue to recognize the majority status of the incumbent bargaining agent where no petition for certification election is filed.\nAccording to the foregoing provision, for a union to become an exclusive bargaining representative of a particular establishment, it must emerge as winner in a certification election. In the case at bar, there was no certification election held challenging the majority status of NAMAWU as the exclusive bargaining representative of petitioner's employees.\u00a0 NAMAWU, therefore, remains the exclusive bargaining representative of petitioner's employees and possesses legal standing to represent them.\n\nOne final point.\u00a0 NAMAWU accuses petitioner of forum shopping.\u00a0 NAMAWU alleges that the instant petition is filed for the purpose of preventing the execution of the Quisumbing order as affirmed by this Court on 06 July 1998 in G.R. No. 133519 and on 26 January 2000 in G.R. No. 138996.\n\nPetitioner counters that it did not commit forum shopping because the relief prayed for in the previous case was the reversal of the Trajano order while the relief prayed for in this petition is the reversal of the orders enforcing and executing the terms of the Quisumbing order.\n\nForum shopping exists when a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in, or already resolved adversely, by some other court. [20] It has been characterized as an act of malpractice that is prohibited and condemned as trifling with the courts and abusing their processes.\u00a0 The test in determining whether a party violates the rule against forum shopping is where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in the action under consideration or where the elements of l itis pendentia are present.\u00a0 In turn, the elements of res judicata as enumerated in Sy Kao v. Court of Appeals [21] are as follows: (a) identity of parties; (b) identity of rights asserted and reliefs being founded on the same facts; and (c) identity in the two preceding particulars should be such that any judgment which may be rendered on the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.\n\nIn this case, the parties are the same, petitioner and NAMAWU.\u00a0 The reliefs prayed for are substantially identical which is ultimately the nullification of the Quisumbing order.\u00a0 Likewise, res judicata [22] exists because a ruling of this Court on the issues raised by petitioner would amount to revisiting and re-ventilating the essentially same issue, i.e. , whether or not the Quisumbing order is controlling, which were already passed upon and definitely resolved by this Court in Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Trajano . [23] Even on this ground alone, for being violative of the rule against forum shopping, the instant petition for review should be denied. [24]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.\u00a0 The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 24 January 2002 and its Resolution dated 18 March 2003 are hereby AFFIRMED.\u00a0 With costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPanganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez and Callejo, Sr., JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 45-61.\u00a0 Penned by Associate Justice Rebecca De Guia-Salvador with Associate Justices Eugenio S.

NO. 6986, March 06, 2006 ]\n\nJULIUS V. AGUSTIN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ENRIQUE S. EMPLEO, RESPONDENTD E C I S I O N\nJULIUS V. AGUSTIN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ENRIQUE S. EMPLEO, RESPONDENT\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nThis is a complaint for disbarment [1] filed by complainant Julius V. Agustin against respondent Atty. Enrique S. Empleo for the latter's failure to comply with a court order while acting as the former's counsel, thereby resulting in the outright dismissal of a case and the complainant's counterclaim therein.\n\nRecords reveal that complainant was the defendant in Civil Case No. B-259 for Forcible Entry with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction and Damages then pending before the 2 nd Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Bindoy, Negros Oriental, in which respondent was his counsel.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings in that case, the MCTC issued an Order on September 25, 1998, [2] giving the parties to the case a period of fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof within which to submit their compromise agreement or amicable settlement for the approval of the court.\n\nWith no compromise agreement having been submitted by the parties within the period thus given or thereafter, the MCTC, some four (4) years later, or on August 5, 2002, issued an Order [3] dismissing Civil Case No. B-259 and the counterclaim therein for failure of the parties to prosecute.\n\nBlaming his counsel for the dismissal of the case and his counterclaim therein, complainant filed on October 18, 2004, an administrative complaint against respondent with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), thereat docketed as CBD Case No. 04-1344 .\n\nActing on the complaint, the IBP Director for Bar Discipline, Atty. Rogelio A. Vinluan, required respondent to submit his answer thereto, otherwise he will be considered as in default and the case heard ex-parte . [4]\n\nIn his answer, [5] respondent admits having been complainant's counsel in Civil Case No. B-259 and the dismissal of that case by the MCTC for the parties' failure to submit a compromise agreement. He explained, however, that the non-submission of the compromise agreement was due to complainant's own fault in not contacting him for the purpose of providing the details of said agreement, pointing out that counsels merely assist their clients and do not decide for them in a compromise agreement. Respondent likewise averred that complainant was not prejudiced by the dismissal of Civil Case No. B-259 for the simple reason that the latter was no less the defendant therein and it was the plaintiff who failed to prosecute the case for a long period of time. In any event, respondent alleged that the instant administrative complaint is simply complainant's reaction to his letter dated June 15, 2004 [6] relative to his (respondent's) act of having withdrawn as complainant's counsel in a different case pending before another court.\n\nComplainant, in his Reply-Affidavit, [7] countered that he contacted respondent several times regarding the submission of the compromise agreement in Civil Case No. B-259 . The first was on October 20, 1999 at respondent's residence as the latter was not at his office at that time, in compliance with respondent's letter requesting to see him. The second was on April 19, 2000 when complainant went to respondent's office on account of another case, and there reminded the latter as to the compromise agreement but respondent just made the assurance that he will be the one to make the draft and/or prepare the same. The third was on January 12, 2001, again at the respondent's office where, after being reminded as to the compromise agreement, respondent told him not to be in a hurry because the court can wait for the compromise agreement and besides he is quite busy with other court cases. Denying that the administrative complaint is his reaction to respondent's letter dated June 15, 2004, complainant asserted that said letter concerns another case in connection with which he is preparing another administrative case against respondent.\n\nIn his Rejoinder, [8] respondent denied that complainant contacted and reminded him about the subject compromise agreement, averring that any communication that has happened between him and the complainant pertains to another case. Respondent further averred that complainant is merely attempting to besmirch his unsullied reputation as a legal practitioner since 1975.\n\nAfter the termination of the mandatory preliminary conference, the parties were required to submit their respective position papers with documentary exhibits and affidavits of witnesses, if any, within twenty (20) days from notice, after which the case shall be submitted for resolution. [9]\n\nEventually, on July 26, 2005, the IBP Investigating Commissioner, Acerey C. Pacheco, submitted his Report and Recommendation. [10] Said the Commissioner in his report:\nIt is a fact as established by the records that no compromise agreement was submitted to the court despite the receipt of the Order dated September 25, 1998. While it is true that as counsel, respondent do not decide for the complainant to enter into such kind of agreement, respondent is however, duty bound to assist the court in the speedy disposition of cases.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nRespondent's asseveration that he waited for the complainant to provide him with details of the compromise agreement but the latter failed to come does not inspire belief in the face of the denials made by the complainant. Not even a piece of paper or letter requesting the complainant to provide him with the details of the agreement was presented to substantiate such allegation.\n\nAnd even assuming arguendo that respondent indeed asked the complainant of such details, the period of almost four (4) years from September 25, 1998 (date of the Order requiring the submission of the compromise agreement) up to August 5, 2002 (date of the Order dismissing the case for failure to submit the same) without doing anything to avoid the case being left \"hanging on the air\" betrays respondent's duty towards the court. As an officer of the court whose primary function is to assist the court in the impartial and speedy adjudication of cases, respondent ought to be vigilant and avoid any act or omission that only impedes and obstructs speedy disposition of cases.\n\nIn the case at bar, the period of almost four (4) years of waiting constitutes inaction that caused unnecessary delay in the disposition of said cases. The fact that no damage or prejudice was sustained by the complainant, he being the defendant in that case, is of no moment.\nThus, the Commissioner's recommendation:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully recommended that herein respondent be reprimanded for his inaction over the period of almost four (4) years without doing anything and that a repetition of the same act to be dealt with accordingly. [11]\nOn October 22, 2005, the IBP Board of Governors passed Resolution No. XVII-2005-90 [12] adopting and approving the afore-quoted report and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner, to wit:\nRESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner of the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex \"A\"; and, finding the recommendation fully supported by the evidence on record and the applicable laws and rules, and considering the almost four years of inaction that caused delay in the disposition of the cases, Atty. Enrique S. Empleo is hereby REPRIMANDED and repetition of the same act shall be dealt with accordingly.\nWe are in full accord with the findings and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner as adopted by the IBP Board of Governors.\n\nFirst and foremost among the duties of a lawyer is his duty to the court. The chief mission of an attorney is to assist in the administration of justice and to this end, his client's success in the case is subordinate. As mandated in Canon 12 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:\nA LAWYER SHALL EXERT EVERY EFFORT AND CONSIDER IT HIS DUTY TO ASSIST IN THE SPEEDY AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.\nLike the court itself, a lawyer is an instrument to advance its ends: the speedy, efficient, impartial, correct and inexpensive adjudication of cases and the prompt satisfaction of final judgments. [13] A lawyer should not only help attain these objectives but should likewise avoid any unethical or improper practices that impede, obstruct or prevent their realization, charged as he is with the primary task of assisting in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. [14]\n\nTrue, a lawyer cannot enter into a compromise agreement without his client's consent. Be it remembered, however, that a lawyer is also an officer of the court with the correlative duty to see to it that cases are disposed in the soonest possible time.\n\nHere, respondent, fully aware that there is a pending court order for the submission of a compromise agreement, should have taken pains to remind complainant about it and ascertain the true intent of the latter regarding the same, so that he, as complainant's counsel, can make the necessary legal action in order for the case not to be unduly delayed and appear not to be indefinitely pending in the docket of the court concerned.\n\nMoreover, by respondent's inaction to the court order in Civil Case No. B-259 , he has very well violated his Attorney's Oath to \" obey the laws and legal orders of the duly constituted authorities. \"\n\nLastly, we cannot but note that respondent's conduct relative to the civil case in question likewise fell short of the diligence required of his profession, in violation of Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which demands that a lawyer shall serve his client with competence and diligence. Rule 18.03 of said Canon further states that a lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable.\n\nAs complainant's counsel in Civil Case No. B-259 , it was incumbent upon respondent to invite his client's attention as to the compromise agreement, especially so when there is a pending court order for the submission of the same. There is nothing in the record which shows that respondent did anything in this respect, even when, as per his admission, he and complainant were in communication at that time, albeit, with regards to another case.\n\nThus, by just letting the court order for the submission of a compromise agreement in Civil Case No. B-259 remain unacted upon resulting in the pendency of that case for almost four (4) years until its dismissal for the parties' non-compliance, respondent sorely failed to perform what is required of him as a lawyer and a member of the Bar.\n\nACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Enrique Empleo is hereby REPRIMANDED with WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona and Azcuna, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 1-2.\n\n[2] Annex \"A\" \u2014 Complaint; Rollo , pp. 3-4.\n\n[3] Annex \"B\" \u2014 Complaint; Rollo, pp. 5-6.\n\n[4] Rollo, p. 7.\n\n[5] Rollo, pp. 8-9.\n\n[6] Rollo, p. 11.

NO. 139596, January 24, 2006 ]\n\nCHARLES CU-UNJIENG, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND UNI0N BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N\nCHARLES CU-UNJIENG, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND UNI0N BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nBy this petition for review on certiorari, petitioner Charles Cu-Unjieng seeks the reversal of the following issuances of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 8177-B-UDK, entitled Charles Cu-Unjieng, plaintiff-appellant vs. Union Bank of the Philippines, et al., defendants-appellees, to wit:\nResolution [1] dated May 10,1999 , dismissing, for non-payment of docket and other lawful fees, petitioner's appeal from an earlier decision of the Regional Trial Court at Malolos, Bulacan which dismissed his complaint for specific performance and damages against respondent Union Bank of the Philippines and others; and\n\nResolution [2] dated July 30, 1999 which denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and ordered expunged the appeal brief thereto attached.\nThe facts:\n\nRespondent Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP) is the owner of a parcel of agricultural land with an area of 218,769 square meters situated in Barangay Sta. Maria, San Miguel, Bulacan and registered in its name under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. TC-1062 of the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan.\n\nSometime in January 1994, UBP caused the posting on the bulletin boards of its branch offices of a three-page list of acquired realty assets available for sale to interested parties. Included in said list was the aforementioned parcel of land, offered to be sold for P2,200,000.00.\n\nPetitioner, through a letter [3] dated April 11, 1994 and addressed to Joselito P. Valera, manager of UBP's Acquired Assets Department, offered to buy the subject property for a lesser amount of P2,078,305.50, payable as follows: 50% as down payment with the balance to be paid in equal monthly installments over a period of two (2) years. Petitioner explained that his offer for an amount lesser than UBP's asking price was on account of five (5) tenants occupying the subject land who were allegedly demanding P500,000.00 to voluntarily vacate the same.\n\nAs proof of his interest to buy the property, petitioner tendered PCIB Check No. 565827 for P103,915.27, purportedly representing 10% of the 50% down payment as earnest money or deposit. UBP acknowledged receipt thereof by way of Union Bank Receipt No. 495081 dated April 11, 1994.\n\nOn August 30, 1994, petitioner wrote a follow-up letter to UBP inquiring on the status of his offer to buy the subject premises. [4]\n\nVia a reply-letter dated August 31, 1994, the manager of UBP's Acquired Assets Department advised petitioner that his offer to purchase is yet to be acted upon because the bank was still awaiting the opinion of its legal division regarding the sale of \"CARPable\" agricultural assets acquired by the bank. [5]\n\nAs it turned out, UBP rejected petitioner's offer as shown by the fact that in another letter [6] dated December 19, 1994, the bank informed petitioner that his offer could not be favorably acted upon on account of the legal division's opinion that sales of lands covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law without prior Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) approval are considered null and void. Accordingly, UBP advised petitioner to pick up the refund of his P103,915.27 \"earnest money\" at the bank's disbursing unit.\n\nUnable to accept UBP's rejection of his offer, petitioner, through counsel, made a formal demand [7] for the bank to comply with its obligation to transfer and deliver the title of the subject property to him by executing the proper deed of conveyance, under the terms and conditions set forth in his April 11, 1994 offer.\n\nResponding thereto, UBP, thru its counsel, Atty. Luzano, in a letter [8] dated July 19, 1995, reiterated the bank's rejection of petitioner's offer as \"the land being carpable could only be disposed of by the bank either thru Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS) or compulsory acquisition, the procedure of which is outlined in Sec. 16\" of Republic Act (RA) No. 6657.\n\nIt was against the foregoing backdrop of events that, on February 6, 1997, in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) at Malolos, Bulacan, petitioner filed his complaint [9] in this case for Specific Performance and Damages against UBP, impleading as co-defendant in the suit the Register of Deeds of Bulacan. Docketed as Civil Case No. 80-M-97 and raffled to Branch 9 of the court, the complaint principally sought UBP's compliance with an alleged perfected contract of sale between it and petitioner relative to the parcel of land in question. More specifically, the complaint prays for a judgment ordering UBP to:\na) accept payments from the plaintiff [petitioner] for the sale of the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter dated 11 April 1994;\n\nb) execute a Deed of Absolute Sale over the Property covered by TCT No. TC 1062 of the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Bulacan upon the plaintiff's full payment of the amount of Two Million Seventy Eight Thousand Three Hundred Five & 50/100 (P2,078,305.50) , failing in which, the deputy sheriff should be ordered to execute such deed and the Registry of Deeds to cancel the title of the Bank and issue a new one in favor of the plaintiff;\n\nc) pay plaintiff the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) as moral damages;\n\nd) pay plaintiff the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) as exemplary damages;\n\ne) pay plaintiff the sum of Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00) as attorney's fees; and\n\nf) pay the costs of the suit.\n\nOther reliefs, just and equitable under the premises, are likewise respectfully prayed for. After due proceedings, the trial court, in a decision dated September 1, 1998, [10] upon a finding that no perfected contract of sale transpired between the parties, dismissed petitioner's complaint for lack of sufficient cause of action, thus:\nWHEREFORE, on the basis of the evidence adduced and the laws/jurisprudence applicable thereon, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the complaint in the above entitled case for want of sufficient cause of action as well as the defendant's counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees for lack of proof to warrant the same.\n\nHowever, defendant Union Bank of the Philippines is ordered to reimburse plaintiff Charles Cu-Unjieng the amount of P103,915.27 representing the face value of PCIBank Check No. 565827 tendered by the latter to the former as purported \"earnest money\", with interest thereon at the prevailing rates of interest periodically bestowed by UBP to its savings depositors from April 11, 1994, through the succeeding years, and until the full amount thereof shall have been delivered to the plaintiff.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. With his motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioner filed with the trial court a Notice of Appeal [11] therein making known that he is taking an appeal from the adverse decision to the CA. Acting thereon, the trial court issued an Order [12] directing the elevation of the records of the case to the CA, whereat petitioner's appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 8177-B-UDK.\n\nAs things would have it, in the herein first assailed Resolution dated May 10, 1999, the CA dismissed petitioner's appeal for nonpayment of the required docket and other lawful appeal fees, to wit:\n\nFor failure of the appellant [petitioner] to pay the docket and other lawful fees (Sec. 4, Rule 41, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure), the Court Resolved to DISMISS the appeal pursuant to Sec. 1(c), Rule 50 of the same Rule.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, attaching thereto his appellant's brief. However, in a subsequent Resolution dated July 30, 1999, [14] the appellate court denied the motion and even expunged from the record the appellant's brief thereto attached:\nActing on the motion of the plaintiff-appellant [petitioner] for a reconsideration of the Resolution of May 10, 1999, which dismissed the appeal for the reason stated therein, and considering the opposition interposed thereto by defendant-appellee [respondent] Union Bank of the Philippines and it appearing that the filing of the notice of appeal of November 5, 1988, was not accompanied by the full and correct payment of the corresponding appellate court docket and other lawful fees, and for such tardiness of more than four (4) months, the Court resolved to DENY the motion for reconsideration and the attached brief thereto ordered EXPUNGED.\n\nIn Pedrosa vs. Hill, 257 SCRA 373, the Supreme Court, citing Rodillas vs. Commission on Elections (245 SCRA 702 aptly said:\n\nxxx the mere filing of the notice of appeal was not enough. It should be accompanied by the payment of the correct amount of appeal fee. In other words, the payment of the full amount of the docket fee is an indispensable step for the perfection of an appeal. In both original and appellate cases, the court acquires jurisdiction over the case only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fees. Well-rooted is the principle that perfection of an appeal within the statutory or reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional and failure to do so renders the questioned decision final and executory, and deprives the appellate court or body of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment much less to entertain the appeal. This requirement of an appeal fee is by no means a mere technicality of law or procedure. It is an essential requirement without which the decision appealed from would become final and executory, as if no appeal was filed at all.\n\nSO ORDERED. Undaunted, petitioner is now with us via the present recourse seeking a relaxation of procedural rules and ultimately the reversal and setting aside of the assailed twin resolutions of the appellate court.\n\nPetitioner would have the Court view his failure to pay the appeal docket fees on time as a non-fatal lapse, or a non-jurisdictional defect which the CA should have ignored in order to attain substantial justice. Further, petitioner passes the blame to the RTC clerk of court who allegedly made the erroneous computation of docket fees.\n\nWe are not persuaded.\n\nDoctrinally entrenched is the pronouncement that the right to appeal is merely statutory and a party seeking to avail of that right must comply with the statute or rules. [15]\n\nRule 41, Section 4, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\nSEC. 4. Appellate court docket and other lawful fees. - Within the period for taking an appeal, the appellant shall pay to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from, the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees. Proof of payment of said fees shall be transmitted to the appellate court together with the original record or the record on appeal. Well-settled is the rule that payment of the docket and other legal fees within the prescribed period is both mandatory and jurisdictional, [16] noncompliance with which is fatal to an appeal. For, to stress, appeal is not a matter of right, but a mere statutory privilege. [1 7]\n\nAn ordinary appeal from a decision or final order of the RTC to the CA must be made within fifteen (15) days from notice. [18] And within this period, the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees must be paid to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from.\n\nTime and again, this Court has consistently held that full payment of docket fees within the prescribed period is mandatory for the perfection of an appeal. Without such payment, the appeal is not perfected and the appellate court does not acquire jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, thereby rendering the decision sought to be appealed final and executory. [19]\n\nFor sure, nonpayment of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees within the reglementary period as provided under Section 4, Rule 41, supra, is a ground for the dismissal of an appeal under Section 1(c) of Rule 50, to wit:\nSECTION 1. Grounds for dismissal of appeal. - An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nc. Failure of the appellant to pay the docket and other lawful fees as provided in section 4 of Rule 41; xxx This Court has invariably sustained the CA's dismissal on technical grounds under the aforequoted provision unless considerations of equity and substantial justice present cogent reasons to hold otherwise. True, the rules may be relaxed but only for persuasive and weighty reasons, to relieve a litigant of an injustice commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. [20] So it is that in La Salette College vs. Victor Pilotin, [21] we held:\nNotwithstanding the mandatory nature of the requirement of payment of appellate docket fees, we also recognize that its strict application is qualified by the following: first, failure to pay those fees within the reglementary period allows only discretionary, not automatic, dismissal; second, such power should be used by the court in conjunction with its exercise of sound discretion in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play, as well as with a great deal of circumspection in consideration of all attendant circumstances Then, too, in Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA) vs. Mangubat, [22] we held that late payment of docket fees may be admitted when the party showed willingness to abide by the Rules by immediately paying the required fees. Mactan, however, cannot be a source of comfort for herein petitioner. For there, the appellate docket fees were paid six (6) days after the timely filing of the notice of appeal. Unlike in Mactan, payment of the appellate docket fees in this case was effected by petitioner only after four (4) months following the expiration of the reglementary period to take an appeal.\n\nWith the reality obtaining in this case that payment of the appellate docket fees was belatedly made four (4) months after the lapse of the period for appeal, it appears clear to us that the CA did not acquire jurisdiction over petitioner's appeal except to order its dismissal, [23] as it rightfully did. Thus, the September 1, 1998 decision of the RTC has passed to the realm of finality and became executory by operation of law.\n\nWe must emphasize that invocation of substantial justice is not a magical incantation that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules. Rules of procedure are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party's substantive rights. Like all rules, they are required to be followed. So it must be here.\n\nWHEREFORE, petition is DENIED and the assailed resolutions dated May 10,1999 and July 30, 1999 of the Court of Appeals AFFIRMED.\n\nCosts against petitioner.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona and Azcuna, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Teodoro P.

Indeed, a survey enjoys the presumption of accuracy until it can be proven otherwise. (Rollo, p. 129) On appeal, the RTC further elucidated, thus: Anent the conclusion of the court a quo that indeed the defendants-appellants have encroached upon a portion of the plaintiffs-appellees\u2019 lot, this Court finds no reason to disturb the same. It must be pointed out that there was already an admission at the barangay level that the defendants-appellants have encroached on the lot of the plaintiffs-appellees as evidenced by Exhibit \u201cR\u201d which was not controverted. This fact stems from a verification survey conducted by no less than a representative from the DENR, a government entity. The rule is that: \u201cGovernment officials are presumed to perform their functions with regularity and strong evidence is necessary to rebut this presumption.\u201d Moreover, it has been held that: \u201cAbsent a strong showing to the contrary, the Court must accept the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.\u201d (Rollo, p. 155, citations omitted).

NO. 149118, February 16, 2006 ]\n\nFLAVIANA LIM CAJAYON AND CARMELITA LIM CONSTANTINO, PETITIONERS, VS. SPOUSES SANTIAGO AND FORTUNATA BATUYONG, RESPONDENTS. \n\nD E C I S I O N\nFLAVIANA LIM CAJAYON AND CARMELITA LIM CONSTANTINO, PETITIONERS, VS. SPOUSES SANTIAGO AND FORTUNATA BATUYONG, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari challenges the two rulings of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP. No. 50952.\u00a0 The first decision dated 27 November 2000 [1] upheld the ruling of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirming the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) order for ejectment, while the Resolution dated 5 July 2001 [2] denied the motion for reconsideration.\n\nFirst, the factual background of the case.\n\nFlaviana Lim Cajayon and Carmelita Lim Constantino (petitioners) and Isagani P. Candelaria (Candelaria) were co-owners of a 260-square meter lot, then covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. C-10870.\u00a0 On 1 February 1995, a partition agreement [3] was entered into by petitioners and Candelaria, wherein Lot 6-A, Psd 00-034294, containing an area of 100 square meters, more or less, was adjudicated to Candelaria, while Lot 6-B, Psd 00-034294, containing an area of 160 square meters, more or less, was given to petitioners.\u00a0 TCT No. C-10870 was cancelled and TCT No. 288500 was issued in the name of petitioners.\n\nOn 30 May 1995, Candelaria sold his property, including the improvements thereon, to Spouses Santiago and Fortunata Batuyong (respondents).\u00a0 TCT No. 294743 was issued in their names over the said parcel of land. [4]\n\nOn 21 May 1996, petitioners started the construction of a seven (7)-door bungalow-type building that allegedly intruded into the lot of respondents.\u00a0 At the instance of respondents, petitioners were summoned by barangay officials to a meeting on the matter.\u00a0 It was then agreed upon that petitioners would defer the construction work pending the result of a relocation survey to be conducted by a government surveyor.\n\nA verification survey was conducted by Geodetic Engineer Florentina C. Valencia.\u00a0 She submitted a report dated 12 November 1996 which yielded the findings that Lot 6-A (Candelaria\u2019s) and Lot 6-B (petitioners\u2019) were not correctly positioned geographically on the ground with respect to TCT No. 294743.\u00a0 Thus, as per survey, sub-lot B with an area of 10.43 square meters serves as right of way of Lot 6-B (petitioners\u2019 lot) while sub-lot C with an area of 10.18 square meters was the portion of Lot 6-A (respondents\u2019 lot) presently occupied by petitioners. [5]\n\nDespite the delineation of said boundaries, petitioners proceeded with the forestalled construction, allegedly occupying at least 20.61 square meters of respondents\u2019 lot, including the portion being used as right of way for petitioners\u2019 tenants.\n\nAfter respondents secured a permit from the barangay and the Caloocan City Building Official to fence their lot, they made demands to petitioners to vacate the encroached portion but to no avail.\u00a0 Respondents brought the matter to the barangay but no amicable settlement was reached.\u00a0\u00a0 A Certificate to File Action was issued to them by the Barangay Lupon Tagapayapa.\u00a0 A final demand was made through a letter dated 20 May 1997 upon petitioners to vacate the encroached premises.\u00a0 Petitioners, however, vehemently refused to vacate and surrender the premises.\n\nOn 14 April 1997, respondents filed an ejectment case against petitioners before the Metropolitan Trial Court [6] (MeTC) of Caloocan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 23359.\u00a0 In a Decision [7] dated 2 July 1998, the MeTC ordered petitioners to vacate and surrender possession of a portion of respondents\u2019 lot and to pay P500.00 per month as fair rental value from May 1996 until the premises is finally vacated, plus P5,000.00 as attorney\u2019s fees and costs of the suit. [8]\n\nOn appeal, the RTC [9] affirmed the judgment of the MeTC. [10] In doing so, the RTC debunked the three (3) arguments posed by petitioners. First, contrary to petitioners\u2019 submission, the RTC ruled that the MeTC had jurisdiction over the instant complaint.\u00a0 The RTC noted that the issue of jurisdiction was never raised in the court a quo while on the other hand, petitioners actively participated in the proceedings therein by filing their Answer and Position Paper.\u00a0 Evidently, petitioners raised the question of jurisdiction as a mere afterthought as he did so only after he obtained an adverse judgment.\u00a0 Second, the allegations of the complaint sufficiently averred a case for ejectment which the RTC found to be within the jurisdiction of the court a quo .\u00a0 Third, the trial court ruled that petitioners categorically recognized the validity of the verification survey\u00a0 done\u00a0 by\u00a0 Engineer\u00a0 Valencia,\u00a0 as\u00a0\u00a0 shown\u00a0\u00a0 by\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0 presence of petitioner Flaviana Cajayon during the verification survey and setting of monuments per survey report. [11]\n\nPetitioners filed a motion for new trial and/or reconsideration but it was denied in an Order [12] dated 12 January 1999 of the RTC.\u00a0 They elevated the case to the Court of Appeals by way of petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.\u00a0 On 27 November 2000, the appellate court rendered a Decision [13] dismissing the petition.\u00a0 Holding that the exclusive jurisdiction to try unlawful detainer cases is vested with the MeTC, the appellate court ratiocinated, thus:\nThe complaint in the instant case establishes jurisdictional facts necessary to sustain the action for unlawful detainer and the remedy it seeks is merely to obtain possession of the controverted lot from respondents.\u00a0 Specifically, it alleges that sometime on May 21, 1996, petitioners started construction works in the area which intruded into a portion of respondents\u2019 property; that the parties eventually agreed to stop the construction subject to the result of a survey to be conducted thereon; that a survey was conducted in the presence of the parties and a report was submitted by Engr. Valencia on November 12, 1996, showing an encroachment of about 20.61 square meters of respondents\u2019 lot including that portion being used as a right of way for petitioners\u2019 tenants; that even after the boundaries had been verified, petitioners resumed the construction on the area; that despite verbal and written demands, the last of which was made on March 20, 1999, petitioners refused to vacate and surrender the encroached area.\u00a0 Surely, respondents\u2019 resort to unlawful detainer when petitioners failed to leave the controverted premises upon demand is in order. [14]\nThe appellate court also held that the fact that petitioners\u2019 houses already stood on the controverted lot long before the purchase of the land by respondents failed to negate the case for ejectment. [15] The appellate court emphasized that prior physical possession is not a condition sine qua non in unlawful detainer cases.\u00a0 The court likewise sustained the RTC findings on the validity of the verification survey conducted by Engineer Valencia that petitioners have encroached on a 20.61 square meter portion of\u00a0 respondents\u2019 lot.\n\nOn 5 July 2001, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution [16] denying petitioners\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration\n\nPetitioners now come to us via the present petition, submitting as issues the question of jurisdiction and the weight to be accorded to the verification survey results. [17]\n\nPetitioners anchor their petition on the court a quo\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over the instant suit.\u00a0 The averments in the complaint do not make out a case for ejectment, they claim, as their entry into the disputed lot was not made by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth.\u00a0 Neither was their possession of the disputed property by virtue of the tolerance of respondents or the latter\u2019s predecessor-in-interest.\n\nRespondents counter that the jurisdictional elements necessary to maintain an action for unlawful detainer clearly obtain in the case at bar, namely: (a) after the parties agreed to the conduct of a survey by a government surveyor and after the survey, it was determined that the structures introduced by herein petitioners have encroached a portion of herein respondents\u2019 lot;\u00a0 (b) notices to vacate and surrender of possession of the encroached portion were made to petitioners, the last being on March 20, 1997; and\u00a0 (c) the suit was instituted on April 11, 1997 or within one (1) year from date of last demand. [18]\n\nRespondents also stress that possession of the premises by petitioners took place more than one year before the filing of the complaint and the absence of an allegation in the complaint that such possession of the disputed portion was merely by virtue of respondents\u2019 tolerance does not deprive the lower court of its original and exclusive jurisdiction nor will it negate respondents\u2019 action for unlawful detainer. [19]\n\nIt is settled that jurisdiction of the court in ejectment cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint and the character of the relief sought. [20]\n\nThe Complaint [21] filed by respondents (plaintiffs therein) alleged these material facts:\n2. That defendants and Isagani P. Candelaria were the former co-owners of a certain piece of land located in Maypajo, Caloocan City containing an area of 260 square meters, more or less, under TCT No. C-10870 issued by the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City;\n\n3. That on February 1, 1995, said co-owners subdivided this parcel of land by virtue of a Partition Agreement wherein Lot 6-A, Psd 00-034294, containing an area of 100 square meters, more or less, was given to Isagani P. Candelaria, while Lot 6-B, Psd 00-034294, containing an area of 160 square meters, more or less, was given to defendants. A copy of said Partition Agreement is hereto attached as Annex \u201cA\u201d;\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\n5. That on May 30, 1995, Isagani P.

That sometime in May 21, 1996, defendants started construction works in the area and intruded into the lot owned by the plaintiffs causing the latter to protest and report the matter to the barangay authorities;\n\n8. That on the same day, the parties were summoned to appear before the Barangay Chairman wherein defendants agreed to stop the construction works, and in a subsequent conference on June 7, 1996, they agreed to defer the matter pending the result of a survey to be conducted by a government surveyor;\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\n11. That the following day, September 5, 1996, Geodetic Engineer Florentina C. Valencia conducted a survey of the aforesaid property and placed the concrete monuments thereon in the presence of plaintiffs and defendants;\n\n12. That on November 12, 1996, a verification survey report was submitted by Geodetic Engineer Florentina C. Valencia together with the survey verification plan xxx;\n\n13. That despite defendants\u2019 knowledge of the property boundary, and despite repeated serious objections from plaintiffs, defendants proceeded to construct a seven-door bungalow-type semi-concrete building, occupying at least 10.18 square meters and another 10.43 square meters for the right of way, thus encroaching upon at least 20.61 square meters of plaintiffs\u2019 lot, and further demolishing plaintiff\u2019s wall.\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\n20. That despite repeated and continuous demands made by plaintiffs upon defendants, both oral and written, the last being on March 20, 1997, defendants in manifest bad faith, wanton attitude, and in a malevolent and oppressive manner and in utter disregard of the property rights of plaintiffs, have failed and refused, and still fail and refuse to vacate the same up to the present time x x x . [22]\nFrom the above-quoted allegations taken in tandem with the textbook distinctions between forcible entry and unlawful detainer, it is clear that the complaint makes out a case for forcible entry, as opposed to unlawful detainer.\u00a0 The distinctions between the two forms of ejectment suits, are: first, in forcible entry, the plaintiff must prove that he was in prior physical possession of the premises until he was deprived thereof by the defendant, whereas, in unlawful detainer, the plaintiff need not have been in prior physical possession; second, in forcible entry, the possession of the land by the defendant is unlawful from the beginning as he acquires possession thereof by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth, while in unlawful detainer, the possession of the defendant is inceptively lawful but it becomes illegal by reason of the termination of his right to the possession of the property under his contract with the plaintiff; third, in forcible entry, the law does not require a previous demand for the defendant to vacate the premises, but in unlawful detainer, the plaintiff must first make such demand, which is jurisdictional in nature. [23]\n\nRespondents had been in prior physical possession of the property in the concept of owner prior to petitioners\u2019 intrusion on 21 May 1996.\u00a0 When petitioners encroached upon respondents\u2019 lot and started construction works thereon the latter was dispossessed of the area involved.\u00a0 Despite various demands by respondents to vacate, petitioners obstinately refused to do so. Clearly, petitioners\u2019 entry into the said property was illegal from the beginning, precluding an action for unlawful detainer.\n\nOn the other hand, to establish a case of forcible entry, the complaint must allege that one in physical possession of a land or building has been deprived of that possession by another through force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth. [24] It is not essential, however, that the complaint should expressly employ the language of the law.\u00a0 It would be sufficient that facts are set up showing that dispossession took place under said conditions. [25]\n\nThe words \"by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth\" include every situation or condition under which one person can wrongfully enter upon real property and exclude another, who has had prior possession thereof. To constitute the use of \"force\" as contemplated in the above-mentioned provision, the trespasser does not have to institute a state of war. Nor is it even necessary that he use violence against the person of the party in possession. The act of going on the property and excluding the lawful possessor therefrom necessarily implies the exertion of force over the property, and this is all that is necessary. [26] In the case at bar, petitioners\u2019 encroachment into respondents\u2019 property in an oppressive and malevolent manner, coupled with their\u00a0 refusal to vacate the premises despite knowledge of the proper boundaries and heedless of respondents\u2019 serious objections, indelibly connotes \u201cforce\u201d within the meaning of the law.\n\nPetitioners contend that while they concede they might have intruded on respondents\u2019 property, the action is barred by prescription because it was filed more than one (1) year after the occurrence of the alleged intrusion.\u00a0 The contention is baseless.\u00a0 Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court allows a plaintiff to bring an action in the proper inferior court for forcible entry or unlawful detainer within one (1) year, respectively, after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession.\u00a0 In forcible entry, the one-year period is counted from the date of actual entry on the land. [27]\n\nRecords show that the ejectment suit was instituted on 11 April 1997.\u00a0 Petitioners\u2019 actual entry into the property, according to the complaint, took place on 21 May 1996.\u00a0 Thus, the suit was filed well within the one (1)-year period mandated by law.\n\nAs a collateral issue, petitioners claim that they are at least entitled to the rights of a builder in good faith on the premise that they are not the owners of the property encroached upon.\n\nThis contention is not tenable. Good faith consists in the belief of the builder that the land he is building on is his and his ignorance of any defect or flaw in his title. [28] In the instant case, when the verification survey report came to petitioners\u2019 knowledge their good faith ceased.\u00a0 The survey report is a professional\u2019s field confirmation of petitioners\u2019 encroachment of respondents\u2019 titled property. It is doctrinal in land registration law that possession of titled property adverse to the registered owner is necessarily tainted with bad faith.\u00a0 Thus, proceeding with the construction works on the disputed lot despite knowledge of respondents\u2019 ownership put petitioners in bad faith.\n\nNow, the second issue.\u00a0 Petitioners question the evidentiary weight of the verification survey report.\u00a0 They point out that since the survey was a unilateral act of respondents, done as it was without their consent, they should not be bound by its findings. [29]\n\nIn raising the issue, petitioners are in effect asking this Court to reassess the factual findings of the courts below, a task which is beyond this Court\u2019s domain.\u00a0 Factual matters cannot be raised in a petition for review on certiorari. This Court at this stage is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts. [30] We find no ample reason to depart from this rule, more so in this case where the Court of Appeals has affirmed the factual findings of the RTC and the MeTC.\n\nMoreover, there is a presumption that official duty is regularly performed, [31] i.e., government officials who perform them are clothed with the presumption of regularity, [32] as the courts below pointed out. [33] In this case, the verification survey was conducted by a government functionary.\n\nEven prescinding from the presumption of regularity, what appears on record is that the verification survey was conducted with the agreement of both parties and in their presence.\u00a0 That was the finding made by the courts below and affirmed by the appellate court without any wrinkle.

( Rollo, p. 129)\n\nOn appeal, the RTC further elucidated, thus:\n\nAnent the conclusion of the court a quo that indeed the defendants-appellants have encroached upon a portion of the plaintiffs-appellees\u2019 lot, this Court finds no reason to disturb the same.\n\nIt must be pointed out that there was already an admission at the barangay level that the defendants-appellants have encroached on the lot of the plaintiffs-appellees as evidenced by Exhibit \u201cR\u201d which was not controverted.\n\nThis fact stems from a verification survey conducted by no less than a representative from the DENR, a government entity.\u00a0 The rule is that: \u201cGovernment officials are presumed to perform their functions with regularity and strong evidence is necessary to rebut this presumption.\u201d\u00a0 Moreover, it has been held that: \u201cAbsent a strong showing to the contrary, the Court must accept the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.\u201d\u00a0 (Rollo, p. 155, citations omitted).\n\n[34] Rollo, p. 14.\n\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

NO. 150910, February 06, 2006 ]\n\nBIENVENIDO GONZALUDO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT. \nD E C I S I O N\nBIENVENIDO GONZALUDO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nUnder consideration is this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court to nullify and set aside\u00a0 the following issuances of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 22185 , to wit:\nDecision dated 19 July 2001 , [1] dismissing the appeal thereto taken by the herein petitioner from a judgment of conviction promulgated by the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City, Branch 50, in a criminal case for estafa thru falsification of public document thereat commenced by the People against four (4) accused, including the petitioner; and\n\nResolution dated 22 October 2001 , [2] denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration. The material facts may be briefly stated, as follows:\n\nBefore his death in 1992, one Ulysses Villaflor was a member of the Bacolod City Police Office.\u00a0 On January 11, 1978, Ulysses married Anita Manlangit in Bacolod City.\u00a0 Thereafter, the couple stayed with Ulysses's mother Anastacia Tobongbanua at the latter's house at\u00a0 Purok 5, Mansungay, Bacolod City.\n\nLater, Ulysses was assigned to Pagadian City.\u00a0 However, he would often go home to Bacolod City to supervise his tire-recapping business thereat.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife Anita secured a teaching job in Catubig, Samar prompting her to leave Bacolod City and live in Samar.\n\nAfter less than a year in Pagadian City, Ulysses was re-assigned to Bacolod City.\u00a0 And, in December of 1978, he was able to buy for P1,500.00 a small house located near that of his mother at Purok 5, Mansungay, Bacolod City.\n\nThen, in 1985, Ulysses took one Rosemarie Gelogo as his mistress and brought her into the house. In time, improvements were made on the house, the most substantial of which were those introduced sometime in March 1991.\u00a0 What used to be a small house, which Ulysses bought for only P1,500.00, was thus transformed into a 2-storey structure partially made of concrete hollow blocks and with galvanized iron roofing which thereby enhanced its value to P200,000.00.\n\nAfter Ulysses's demise in January of 1992, his mistress Rosemarie Gelogo offered to sell the 2-storey house for P80,000.00 to herein petitioner Bienvenido Gonzaludo, a.k.a. Ben Gonzaludo, who lives just nearby.\u00a0 Initially, petitioner was not interested to buy the house because he already had one, let alone the fact that he did not have enough money for the purpose. Nonetheless, since the house was being sold for a cheap price, petitioner convinced the spouses Gregg Canlas and Melba Canlas, to whom he is related by affinity, to buy the same.\u00a0 Herein, petitioner introduced the Canlases to Rosemarie Gelogo.\n\nOn January 20, 1993, Rosemarie Gelogo and Gregg Canlas executed a Deed of Sale, [3] witnessed by petitioner. In that deed, Rosemarie Gelogo signed as Rosemarie G. Villaflor and represented\u00a0 herself to be the lawful owner of the 2-storey house. By virtue of the same deed, vendee Gregg Canlas acquired all of Rosemarie's rights and interest on the subject house.\n\nLater, upon complaint of Ulysses's widow Anita Manlangit, an Information dated May 31, 1994 [4] was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City charging Rosemarie Gelogo, alias Rosemarie Villaflor, the spouses Gregg Canlas and Melba Canlas and petitioner with the crime of Estafa thru Falsification of Public Document allegedly committed, as follows:\nThat on or about the 20 th day of January, 1993 in the City of Bacolod, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein accused, conspiring, confederating and acting in concert, with intent to gain, defrauded the herein offended party, Anita Manlangit Vda. de Villaflor, herein represented by her mother-in-law and Attorney-in-Fact, Anastacia Tobongbanua, in the following manner, to wit:\u00a0 that accused Rosemarie Gelogo alias Rosemarie G. Villaflor being the occupant of a house made of concrete materials with a floor area of 40 ft. by 24 ft., with galvanized iron roofing, worth P200,000.00, owned by the deceased Ulysses Villaflor, husband of the herein offended party, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of falsification by then and there preparing and/or causing to be prepared a public document denominated as a Deed of Sale dated January 20, 1993 entered as Doc. No. 402, Page No. 81, Book No. XVII, Series of 1993 of the Notarial Register of Atty. Ramon B. Clapiz, to the effect that she is the lawful owner of the said house and affixing or causing to be affixed thereon her name and signature, Rosemarie G. Villaflor, purportedly as wife of the deceased Ulysses Villaflor, thus making untruthful statement in the narration of facts as accused well know that such was not the case for the deceased Ulysses Villaflor has a legal wife in the person of the herein offended party, by reason of which accused was able to effect the sale and eventual occupancy of the said house to the herein accused Sps. Gregg Canlas and Melba Canlas who despite of their knowledge that such house was not owned by Rosemarie Gelogo bought the same from her in the amount of P80,000.00 and, herein accused Bienvenido Gonzaludo alias \"Ben\", despite of his knowledge that such house was not owned by Rosemarie Gelogo, participated in the commission of the herein offense by causing his name and signature to be affixed in the said Deed of Sale as witness to the fraudulent sale entered into by the parties, to the damage and prejudice of the herein offended party in the amount of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P200,000.00), Philippine Currency.\n\nAct contrary to law.\nDocketed as Criminal Case No. 94-16532, the Information was raffled to Branch 50 of the court.\n\nBecause accused Rosemarie Gelogo remained at large, only the spouses Gregg Canlas and Melba Canlas and herein petitioner were arraigned, all of whom entered a plea of \"Not Guilty.\"\n\nAfter due proceedings, the trial court,\u00a0 in a decision dated\u00a0 February 17, 1998, [5] acquitted the Canlas spouses but convicted petitioner of the complex crime of Estafa Thru Falsification of Public Document and sentenced him accordingly.\u00a0 Dispositively, the decision reads:\nFOR ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Bienvenido Gonzaludo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as a principal and co-conspirator of the complex Crime of Estafa Thru Falsification of a Public Document and there being no extenuating circumstances and pursuant to the provision of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Temporal.\u00a0 Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the accused is sentenced to a prison term of Eight (8) years of Prision Mayor to Twenty (20) years of Reclusion Temporal.\u00a0 By way of Civil Liability, the accused is sentenced to pay the offended party the sum of P200,000.00, representing the value of the house and the sum of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees.\n\nThe case with respect to the accused-Spouses Gregg and Melba Canlas is ordered dismissed as their guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.\nTherefrom, petitioner went to the CA via ordinary appeal in CA-G.R. CR No. 22185.\n\nAs stated at the outset hereof, the appellate court, in its decision dated July 19, 2001, dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of merit and affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction, thus:\nWHEREFORE , foregoing premises considered, the appeal is hereby ordered DISMISSED , having no merit in fact and in law, and the decision of the trial court AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED. With his motion for reconsideration having been denied by the CA in its resolution of October 22, 2001, petitioner is now with us via the present recourse on his submissions that the CA erred when it -\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nI\u2013 | xxx sustained the decision of the trial court convicting the petitioner of the crime of Estafa thru Falsification of Public Document as defined and punished under Paragraph 2(a), Article 315, Revised Penal Code EVEN IF not any of the statutory elements of the crime herein charged is present or has been proved and/or not all of the statutory elements of the offense thus charged are present or have been proved beyond reasonable doubt;\n | \nII\u2013 | xxx sustained the conviction of your petitioner ALTHOUGH the material allegations in the information filed below have not been proved at all beyond reasonable doubt;\n | \nIII\u2013 | xxx sustained the conviction of herein petitioner of a crime not properly charged in the information;\n | \nIV\u2013 | xxx grossly misappreciated the facts and misapplied the law and jurisprudence concerning the status of the house subject of this case as to whether the same is totally a conjugal property of Ulysses and Anita or the house wholly or substantially belongs to Rosemarie Gelogo a.k.a.

[6] The Court is duty-bound to look into the validity of the factual and legal basis relied upon by the two (2) courts below in convicting petitioner in this case.\n\nIt is worthy to note that petitioner was convicted by the trial court of the complex crime charged in the Information for allegedly having conspired with Rosemarie Gelogo, who used the fictitious surname \"Villaflor \" for the purpose of giving her a semblance of authority to sell the house purportedly owned by her paramour, Ulysses Villaflor, who was legally married to private complainant, Anita Villaflor.\n\nFirst and foremost, therefore, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish Rosemarie Gelogo's criminal liability for the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public document, and thereafter, establish by proof beyond reasonable doubt that herein petitioner conspired with Rosemarie in the commission of the same complex crime.\u00a0 In other words, if Rosemarie cannot be held liable for the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public document\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 under the Information filed in this case, with all the more reason should it be for petitioner, as alleged co-conspirator.\n\nFor an accused to be convicted of the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public document, all the elements of the two crimes of estafa and falsification of public document must exist.\n\nTo secure conviction for estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code, the Court has time and again ruled that the following requisites must concur:\n(1) that the accused made false pretenses or fraudulent representations as to his power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions;\n\n(2) that such false pretenses or fraudulent representations were made prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud;\n\n(3) that such false pretenses or fraudulent representations constitute the very cause which induced the offended party to part with his money or property; and\n\n(4) that as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage [7] (Emphasis supplied).\nThere is no question that the first, second and fourth elements are present: there was false or fraudulent misrepresentation by Rosemarie Gelogo when she used the fictitious surname \"Villaflor\"; the misrepresentation or false pretense was made prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud; and private complainant Anita Manlangit's right to the subject 2-storey house was lost or at the very least prejudiced when Rosemarie sold it to the Canlases.\n\nIt is petitioner's thesis, however, that there is here an absence of the third element, i.e., \"that such false pretenses or fraudulent representations constitute the very cause which induced the offended party to part with his money or property,\" contending that private complainant Anita Manlangit, who was the offended party in this case, was never induced to part with any money or property by means of fraud, committed simultaneously with the false pretense or fraudulent representation by Rosemarie.\n\nWe find merit in petitioner's submission.\n\nAs early as in the 1903 case of U.S. vs. Mendezona , [8] we held that therein accused may be convicted for estafa only when the deceit or false pretenses, committed simultaneously with the fraud, were the efficient cause or primary consideration which induced the offended party to part with his money or property.\n\nThirty (30) years thereafter, the rule remains the same.\u00a0 In the 1933 case of People vs. Lilius , [9] the Court, through then Chief Justice Ramon Avance\u00f1a, acquitted the accused of estafa because the deceit did not precede the defraudation, which means that the deceit was not the cause which could have induced the damage or prejudice to or loss of property suffered by the injured party.\n\nIn the cases of People vs. Quesada , [10] People vs. Fortuno , [11] and People vs. Sabio , [12] which span more than another forty-five (45) years after Lilius , the Court continued to apply the same principle in determining criminal liability for estafa, i.e., that the deceit must have been committed prior to or simultaneous with the fraudulent act because this was the only way that said deceit could become the efficient cause or primary consideration which could have induced the offended party to part with his money or property.\n\nThe doctrine remains the same a hundred (100) years after the 1903 case of Mendezona . Thus, in the 2003 case of Alcantara vs. Court of Appeals , [13] this Court acquitted the therein accused of the crime of estafa explaining, through Justice Romeo J. Callejo, Sr.,\u00a0 that the false pretense or fraudulent act must be committed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, thus:\nxxx fraud in its general sense is deemed to comprise anything calculated to deceive, including all acts, omissions, and concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence justly reposed, resulting in damage to another, or by which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another. It is a generic term embracing all multifarious means which human ingenuity can device, and which are resorted to by one individual to secure an advantage over another by false suggestions or by suppression of truth and includes all surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling and. any unfair way by which another is cheated. And deceit is the false representation of a matter of fact whether by words or conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed which deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. The false pretense or fraudulent act must be committed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud. We find no cogent reason to depart from this settled principle that the deceit, which must be prior to or simultaneously committed with the act of defraudation, must be the efficient cause or primary consideration which induced the offended party to part with his money or property and rule differently in the present case.\n\nWhile it may be said that there was fraud or deceit committed by Rosemarie in this case, when she used the surname \"Villaflor\" to give her semblance of authority to sell the subject 2-storey house, such fraud or deceit was employed upon the Canlas spouses who were the ones who parted with their money when they bought the house. However, the Information charging Rosemarie of estafa in the present case, alleged damage or injury not upon the Canlas spouses, but upon private complainant, Anita Manlangit. Since the deceit or fraud was not the efficient cause and did not induce Anita Manlangit to part with her property in this case, Rosemarie cannot be held liable for estafa.\u00a0 With all the more reason must this be for herein petitioner.\n\nThe lack of criminal liability for estafa, however, will not necessarily absolve petitioner from criminal liability arising from the charge of falsification of public document under the same Information charging the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public document.\u00a0 It is settled doctrine that \u2013\nWhen a complex crime has been charged in an information and the evidence fails to support the charge on one of the component offenses, can the defendant still be separately convicted of the other offense?\u00a0 The question has long been answered in the affirmative.\u00a0 In United States vs. Lahoylahoy and Madanlog (38 Phil. 330), the Court has ruled to be legally feasible the conviction of an accused on one of the offenses included in a complex crime charged, when properly established, despite the failure of evidence to hold the accused of the other\u00a0 charge. [14]\nArticle 172 of the Revised Penal Code punishes any private individual who shall commit any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171 in any public or official document or letter of exchange or any other kind of commercial document. In turn, Article 171 of the same Code provides:\nArt. 171. Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister .- The penalty of prision mayor and a fine not to exceed P5,000 pesos [sic] shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:\nCounterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;\n\nCausing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;\n\nAttributing to persons who have participated in any act or proceeding statements other than those in fact made by them;\n\nMaking untruthful statements in a narration of facts;\n\nAltering true dates;\n\nMaking any alteration or intercalation in a genuine document which changes its meaning;\n\nIssuing in an authenticated form a document purporting to be a copy of an original document when no such original exists, or including in such a copy a statement contrary to, or different from, that of the genuine original; or\n\nIntercalating any instrument or note relative to the issuance thereof in a protocol, registry, or official book. The same penalty shall be imposed upon any ecclesiastical minister who shall commit any of the offenses enumerated in the preceding paragraphs of this article, with respect to any record or document of such character that its falsification may affect the civil status of persons. (Emphasis supplied)\nAs correctly found by the trial court, petitioner conspired with Rosemarie to falsify, that is, by making untruthful statement in the narration of facts in the deed of sale, by declaring Rosemarie to be the owner of the house subject of such sale and signing as \"Rosemarie Villaflor\" instead of her real name, Rosemarie Gelogo, in order to sell the same to the Canlas spouses.\u00a0 It is established by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that Rosemarie committed the crime of falsification of public document.\u00a0 Likewise, proof beyond reasonable doubt has been duly adduced to establish conspiracy between Rosemarie and petitioner who is the brother-in-law of Melba Canlas, one of the buyers of the house in this case.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals are hereby MODIFIED. Petitioner is hereby ACQUITTED of the complex crime of Estafa through Falsification of Public Document, but found GUILTY of the crime of Falsification of Public Document and is accordingly imposed an indeterminate sentence of 4 months and 1 day of arresto mayor , as minimum, to 2 years, 4 months and 1 day of prision correccional, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P5,000.00.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPuno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona and Azcuna, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Jose L.

SP No. 51965, which affirmed the Decision dated November 25, 1997 and Resolution dated February 19, 1998 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC CA No. 012651-97; and the CA Resolution dated January 7, 2000, which denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe factual background of the case is as follows:\n\nOn February 26, 1996, Mary Ann Paragas (respondent) filed a complaint for breach of contract, non-payment of monetary benefits and damages against Philips Electronics of Taiwan Ltd. (Philips) and its accredited agent, J.S. Contractor, Inc., (JSCI) before the NLRC, National Capital Region, Quezon City, docketed as NLRC NCR OCW Case No. 00-02-1363-96. [2] She alleged that: on December 14, 1994, she was deployed by JSCI to work as a factory operator for Philips for a period of one year with a monthly salary of NT$13,350.00, exclusive of allowances; she worked at the Philips factory in Chupei City until February 13, 1995; from February 14, 1995 to December 13, 1995, she was assigned to the Philips factory in Chungli City; during the 10 months she worked in Chungli City, she did not receive an additional daily night shift allowance of NT$215.00 and full attendance bonus of NT$900.00 per month, benefits which she enjoyed while in Chupei City; she paid an excessive placement fee of P52,000.00; she returned to the Philippines on December 23, 1995. Respondent prayed that she be paid P207,300.00 for night shift differential, excess placement fee, annual bonus, and full attendance bonus; NT$78,600.00 for salary differential; moral and exemplary damages. [3]\n\nDuring the pendency of the case, the accreditation of JSCI was transferred to Grand Placement and General Services Corporation (petitioner). Consequently, petitioner was impleaded as additional party respondent in the NLRC case.\n\nJSCI denied liability for herein respondent's monetary claims in view of the transfer of accreditation to petitioner. [4] To refute the charge of excessive placement fee, JSCI presented Official Receipt No. 5890 dated October 28, 1994 in the amount of P18,350.00. [5]\n\nFor its part, petitioner averred that it cannot be held liable as transferee agent because it had no privity of contract with respondent. Nonetheless, it argued that respondent is not entitled to her claim of salary differential, night shift differential and full attendance bonus as she was duly paid her salary and other emoluments under her employment contract. It further alleged that respondent's claims were laid to rest in the Decision dated December 9, 1996 in NLRC NCR OCW Case No. 00-02-1362-96, which is a similar case for unpaid monetary benefits filed by Lilibeth Lazaga, respondent's co-worker, wherein the claim of Lazaga is dismissed by the Labor Arbiter, affirmed by the NLRC and the petition for certiorari dismissed by this Court in G.R. No. 130953. [6]\n\nOn February 20, 1997, Labor Arbiter Potenciano S. Ca\u00f1izares, Jr. rendered a decision in favor of respondent, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\nWHEREFORE, the respondents are hereby ordered to pay the complainant the sum of P207,300.00 representing night shift differential, excess of placement fee, annual bonus, and full attendance bonus, plus her salary differential of NT$78,600.00 as computed by her, and the respondents failed to refute by clear and convincing evidence. [7] The Labor Arbiter held that: JSCI failed to refute respondent's monetary claims; there was no legal basis to JSCI's allegation that petitioner, as transferee agent, is answerable as the breach of contract happened when JSCI was Philips' agent; on the issue of transfer of accreditation, Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the Rules and Regulations governing overseas employment issued by the Secretary of Labor and Employment on May 3, 1991 states that \"[t]he accreditation of a principal or a project may be transferred to another agency, provided, that transfer shall not involve any diminution of wages and benefits of workers\"; respondent instituted her complaint precisely on her claims of diminution of wages and benefits and the breach of contractual obligations. [8]\n\nJSCI appealed to the NLRC invoking anew that it is not liable in view of the transfer of its accreditation. It likewise repeated its argument that respondent paid only the amount of P18,350.00 as placement fee.\n\nOn November 25, 1997, the NLRC modified the decision of the Labor Arbiter by dismissing the case against JSCI and holding petitioner solely liable for respondent's claims. [9] It sustained JSCI's view that petitioner should shoulder the liability as transferee agent in accordance with the POEA Rules. The NLRC deleted the award of excess placement fee after considering that Official Receipt No. 5890 dated October 28, 1994 showed that respondent paid the amount of only P18,350.00. [10]\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration [11] but it was dismissed in the NLRC Resolution dated February 19, 1998. [12]\n\nOn May 4, 1998, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari before us, docketed as G.R. No. 133361. [13] On June 22, 1998, the Court granted the temporary restraining order prayed for in the petition and required the NLRC and respondent to comment thereon. [14]\n\nOn January 25 1999, after the parties submitted their respective responsive pleadings, the Court referred the petition to the CA, [15] in accordance with St. Martin Funeral Homes v. National Labor Relations Commission . [16]\n\nOn September 14, 1999, the CA issued the herein assailed Decision affirming the decision of the NLRC and lifting the TRO issued by this Court. [17] The CA held that petitioner is liable under Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules and Regulations, to wit:\nSection 6. Transfer of Accreditation. The accreditation of a principal or a project may be transferred to another agency provided that transfer shall not involve diminution of wages and benefits of workers.\n\nThe transferee agency in these instances shall comply with the requirements for accreditation and shall assume full and complete responsibility for all contractual obligations of the principals to its workers originally recruited and processed by the former agency. Prior to the transfer of accreditation, the Administration shall notify the previous agency and principal of such application. It sustained the NLRC's view that the time of the breach of contract in a case of a valid accreditation is of no moment since the rules did not provide for a qualification and petitioner's Affidavit of Assumption of Responsibility dated July 31, 1996 stated that it is willing to assume any responsibility that may arise or may have arisen with respect to workers recruited by JSCI. It added that while the Supreme Court ruled in ABD Overseas Manpower Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission [18] that the rule on transfer of accreditation should not be given a strict interpretation when the same interpretation would result to grave injustice, said case is inapplicable here since the facts showed that petitioner actively participated in the hearing of the present case and as such, it was given the opportunity to deny its liability and present its defense.\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration [19] and a supplement thereto [20] but the CA denied the motion in a Resolution dated January 7, 2000. [21]\n\nHence, the present petition for review on certiorari on the sole ground, to wit:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED A QUESTION IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT. [22] Petitioner offers five arguments in support thereof:\n\nFirst, it contends that the provisions of the POEA Rules and Regulations on transfer of accreditation is inapplicable because of the express provision of Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042, the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, that the liability of the principal and the recruitment agency is joint and several and continues during the entire duration of the employment contract and shall not be affected by any substitution, amendment or modification made locally or in a foreign country of the said contract.\n\nSecond, it alleges that the CA misapplied ABD Overseas Manpower Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission [23] to the effect that Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules should not be used as a shield against liability by a recruitment agency.\n\nThird, it argues that the conclusions of the Labor Arbiter and NLRC, as affirmed by the CA, were not supported by substantial evidence. It claims that the Solicitor General, in his Comment before the CA, even noted that the defenses presented by the petitioner were not touched in the decisions of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC and suggested that there is a need to remand the case back to the Labor Arbiter for further proceedings on the factual issue of whether respondent is entitled to her monetary claims.\n\nFourth, it submits that the CA misapplied the rule on caveat emptor; that the rule is inapplicable to labor employment contracts which are imbued with public interest and subservient to the police power of the State.\n\nFifth, it maintains that the CA disregarded the doctrine of stare decisis in the light of the Court's ruling on January 14, 1998 in G.R. No. 130953 entitled Lilibeth Lazaga v. National Labor Relations Commission [24] where the Court sustained the NLRC's dismissal for lack of merit of an identical complaint for unpaid monetary claims of respondent's co-worker in Philips.\n\nIn her Comment, [25] respondent alleges that the instant petition merits outright dismissal for being filed out of time since petitioner admitted that its counsel on record, Atty. Ricardo C. Orias, Jr., received copy of the CA Resolution dated January 7, 2000 on January 25, 2000 and the petition was filed only on May 5, 2000 or 101 days late. Respondent submits that the argument that the filing of the petition was delayed because the notice of withdrawal of Atty. Orias, Jr. was not filed on time with the CA by the petitioner as it is not adept to legal intricacies is but a tactical ploy to delay the case and avoid payment of its monetary liability. At any rate, respondent insists that the arguments raised in the petition have already been raised and squarely resolved by the NLRC and the CA.\n\nIn its Reply, [26] petitioner points out that: it received a copy of the CA Resolution dated January 7, 2000 only on March 23, 2000; within fifteen days thereafter it filed before this Court a motion for a thirty-day extension of time or up to May 7, 2000 to file a petition for review on certiorari which was granted by the Court; the petition was filed on May 6, 2000, [27] within the extended period; the failure of Atty. Orias, Jr., who had already withdrawn from the case, to duly inform it that the motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA upon receipt of the CA Resolution dated January 7, 2000 was not its fault and should not be taken against it. It submits that it should be deemed to have notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration only as of the date of its actual receipt, i.e., March 23, 2000. It insists that it should not be made to bear the adverse consequences of Atty. Orias, Jr.'s negligence.\n\nThe Court finds for the petitioner.\n\nTo begin with, the Court is fully aware that procedural rules are not to be belittled or simply disregarded for these prescribed procedures insure an orderly and speedy administration of justice. However, it is equally true that litigation is not merely a game of technicalities. The law and jurisprudence grant to courts the prerogative to relax compliance with procedural rules of even the most mandatory character, mindful of the duty to reconcile both the need to put an end to litigation speedily and the parties' right to an opportunity to be heard. [28]\n\nThe Court has often stressed that rules of procedure are merely tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. They were conceived and promulgated to effectively aid the court in the dispensation of justice. Courts are not slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion. In rendering justice, courts have always been, as they ought to be, conscientiously guided by the norm that on the balance, technicalities take a backseat against substantive rights, and not the other way around. Thus, if the application of the Rules would tend to frustrate rather than promote justice, it is always within our power to suspend the rules or except a particular case from its operation. [29]\n\nIn numerous cases, the Court has allowed liberal construction of the Rules of Court with respect to the rules on the manner and periods for perfecting appeals, when to do so would serve the demands of substantial justice and in the exercise of equity jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. [30] Indeed, laws and rules should be interpreted and applied not in a vacuum or in isolated abstraction but in light of surrounding circumstances and attendant facts in order to afford justice to all. [31] Thus, where a decision may be made to rest on informed judgment rather than rigid rules, the equities of the case must be accorded their due weight because labor determinations should not only be secundum rationem but also secundum caritatem . [32]\n\nIn this particular case, the suspension of the Rules is warranted since the procedural infirmity was not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of petitioner. Petitioner and its counsel, Atty. Orias, Jr., agreed to terminate the services of the latter on January 25, 2000. [33] Atty. Orias, Jr. received the CA Resolution on January 28, 2000. [34] The \"Withdrawal of Appearance\" which Atty. Orias, Jr. gave to petitioner was sent by the latter thru registered mail only on March 24, 2000 and received by the CA on March 27, 2000. [35]\n\nConsidering that only three days have elapsed since the termination of his services, Atty. Orias, Jr. should have promptly relayed to petitioner that he received the Resolution dated January 7, 2000 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration. Had he done so, he would have known that his Withdrawal of Appearance has not been sent yet by petitioner. It is the duty of a lawyer to pay heed to the urgency and importance of registered letter sent by the court. [36] Before the date of receipt on March 27, 2000 by the CA of the Withdrawal of Appearance, Atty. Orias, Jr. remained as petitioner's counsel of record.\n\nOrdinarily, until his dismissal or withdrawal is made of record in court, any judicial notice sent to a counsel of record is binding upon his client even though as between them the professional relationship may have been terminated. [37] However, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, Atty. Orias, Jr. was negligent in not adequately protecting petitioner's interest, which necessarily calls for a liberal construction of the Rules. Verily, the negligence of Atty. Orias, Jr. cannot be deemed as negligence of petitioner itself in the present case. A notice to a lawyer who appears to have been unconscionably irresponsible cannot be considered as notice to his client. [38] Thus, petitioner is deemed to have filed its petition for review on certiorari within the reglementary period as alleged in its Reply.\n\nThe general rule is that findings of fact of the NLRC, as affirmed by the CA, are conclusive upon the Supreme Court when supported by substantial evidence that is manifest in the decision and on the records. [39] However, this Court has recognized several exceptions to this rule, to wit: (1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. [40] In the present case, the Court is constrained to review the NLRC's findings of fact, which the CA chose not to pass upon, as there is ample evidence on record to show that certain facts were overlooked which would clearly affect the disposition of the case.\n\nForemost to consider and point out is that there is no factual basis for the monetary award in respondent's favor. Significantly, the Labor Arbiter merely accepted per se private respondent's computation on her monetary claims in view of JSCI's failure to refute her allegations. He did not assess and weigh or even touch upon herein petitioner's arguments and evidence against respondent's claims. Clearly, the Labor Arbiter should not have precipitately granted private respondent's claims because petitioner had adduced evidence to refute her allegations. Since the Labor Arbiter's decision did not touch upon or rule on petitioner's arguments and evidence against respondent's claims, the NLRC and the CA had no basis for affirming his findings.\n\nPetitioner submits that the NLRC already resolved the same issues in this case in its Decision dated June 25, 1997 in NLRC OCW CA 012269-97, entitled, \"Lilibeth Lazaga v. Grand Placement & General Services Corp., et al.\" [41] and should not be relitigated under the principle of stare decisis.\n\nStare decisis et non quieta movere . Stand by the decision and disturb not what is settled. Stare decisis simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. [42] Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of stare decisis is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue. [43]\n\nIn the Lazaga case, Lazaga was contracted to work as factory worker for Philips in Chupei City, Taiwan for one year, from July 26, 1994 to July 26, 1995 with a stipulated salary of NT$13,350.00. On April 27, 1995, she was transferred to the Philips factory in Chungli City. Upon the expiration of her contract, she extended the same until she was voluntarily repatriated on February 15, 1996. Thereafter, she filed her complaint for non-payment of salary differential, night shift differential, full attendance bonus and payment of excessive placement fee against petitioner, Philips and Labor International Corp., before the NLRC, National Capital Region, Quezon City.\n\nIn her complaint, Lazaga alleged that: she is entitled to salary differential as the salary of NT$13,350.00 in the OFW Info Sheet refers to the basic salary, exclusive of other benefits such as shift allowance, factory incentives, full attendance bonus, monthly dormitory bonus and others; she is entitled to night shift allowance of NT$215.00 and full attendance bonus of NT$900.00 per month, benefits she enjoyed in Chupei City; she paid an excessive placement fee of P30,000.00.\n\nOn December 9, 1996, Labor Arbiter Ariel Cadiente Santos, dismissed Lazaga's complaint for lack of merit. Said the Labor Arbiter in that case:\nComplainant therefore cannot capitalize on the entry on the OCW Info Sheet indicating NT$13,350.00 as the basic salary. This is in light of the clear terms of the Employment Contract she duly executed with respondents. x x x Moreover, complainant herself admits that \"in addition to NT$13,350.00, she also enjoyed other emoluments in the form of bonuses and differential (p; 3, Amended Complaint). Hence, the claim for salary differential is patently without basis.\n\nThe claim for night shift differential is resolved in respondents\" favor. x x x The records of this case disclose that the giving of night differential to the workers at respondents Philips was the subject of a meeting/negotiation on December 21, 1996 and was agreed upon to take effect three (3) months thereafter, i.e., on April 1996. Complainant however, by her own volition, had already caused herself to be repatriated before the effectivity of the giving of night shift differential. She therefore cannot claim entitlement thereto. x x x In the absence of proof that the benefit was agreed upon to have a retroactive effect, complainant's claim for night differential cannot be granted.\n\nThe claim for full attendance bonus is likewise denied for lack of basis. The records indicate that complainant was duly paid the same, as shown by the Employee Payment/Deduct Detail Analysis Report (Annex \"1\", Answer to Amended Complaint). Complainant's allegation cannot prevail over the documentary evidence on record which establish the fact of payment of full attendance bonus. x x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x [C]omplainant's claim for refund of alleged placement fee cannot be sustained against respondent Grand. There is in fact no proof on record that she ever paid respondent Grand the alleged excessive placement fee. xxx [44] On appeal, the NLRC in its Decision dated June 25, 1997, sustained the Labor Arbiter's findings and conclusions. [45] When the NLRC Decision dated June 25, 1997 was elevated to this Court via a petition for certiorari, the First Division, in a minute resolution dated January 14, 1998 [46] dismissed the petition for failure to show that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering the questioned judgment. The resolution became final and executory on February 16, 1998.\n\nThe Lazaga case is not stare decisis to the present case since the factual circumstances surrounding each case is different. The contracts of employment of Lazaga and respondent spanned different periods. Lazaga's contract was from July 26, 1994 to July 26, 1995 and she opted to extend her employment until her repatriation on February 15, 1996, while herein respondent Paragas was employed from December 14, 1994 to December 13, 1995. Furthermore, the contract stipulations in their respective contracts have not been shown to be the same. Lazaga's contract of employment is not part of the evidence on record for a detailed comparison with respondent's contract. Besides, evidence to establish their respective claims for salary differential, night shift differential, full attendance bonus and excessive placement fee are different.\n\nVerily, the resolution of the interpretation of the respondent's contract and her entitlement to salary differential, night shift differential, full attendance bonus and excessive placement fee requires conscientious evaluation and assessment of the evidence adduced by the parties, which is best undertaken by the Labor Arbiter. This Court is not the proper venue to consider factual issues nor is it its function to analyze or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented. Needless to stress, the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts. [47] Ordinarily, the case should be remanded to the Labor Arbiter for proper evaluation of the evidence adduced by the parties. However, considering that the records of the NLRC are before the Court, the Court deems it more appropriate and practical to resolve the present controversy in order to avoid further delay. [48]\n\nAnent the interpretation of the contract of employment regarding the amount of NT$13,350.00, the Court finds that the OCW Info Sheet [49] of respondent indicating NT$13,350.00 as \"basic salary\" cannot be the basis for her claim of salary differential since Article IV of her employment contract specifically provides that the wage for a full month of working shall be NT$13,350.00 only with free food and accommodation. [50] Moreover, the official interpretation of the Philippine Labor Representative to Taiwan, Guerrero N. Cirilo, that the stipulated salary is the \"totality of the amount given to an employee as his compensation for work done on a monthly basis\" [51] should stand, in the absence of evidence that said interpretation is patently erroneous.\n\nAs to the issue on night shift differential, evidence for the petitioner has shown that the employees' agreement with Philips to grant night shift allowance became effective only after February 1996. [52] In the absence of express provision in the agreement, the grant of night shift allowance cannot be interpreted to apply retroactively. In this case, since the grant of night shift allowance became effective three months after respondent's repatriation to the Philippines on December 23, 1995, she is clearly not entitled to night shift differential.\n\nWith regard to the question of respondent's entitlement to salary differential, annual bonus and full attendance bonus, a thorough review of the evidence adduced by the petitioner, comprising of the Employee Payment/Deduct Detail Analysis Report [53] and bank remittance sheets [54] show that respondent has been duly paid her salary, annual bonus and full attendance bonus. The documentary evidence confirms that private respondent's salary and other benefits have been religiously remitted to her bank account. Against petitioner's documentary evidence, respondent offered none of her own to fully substantiate her allegations. Necessarily therefore, her case must fail.\n\nAs to respondent's claim for excessive placement fee, not only did respondent fail to substantiate her claim that she paid the amount of P52,000.00, but JSCI Official Receipt No. 5890 dated October 28, 1994 is ample proof that respondent only paid the amount of P18,350.00. [55] Consequently, the Labor Arbiter's decision to refund the excess placement fee is barren of factual basis. On this score, the NLRC, as affirmed by the CA, aptly deleted the refund of excess placement fee.\n\nHaving ruled that the respondent is not entitled to her monetary claims in the first place, the Court sees no more need to address the other arguments of petitioner.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is GRANTED . The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated September 14, 1999 and January 7, 2000, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 51965, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as it affirms the NLRC's award in favor of respondent Mary Ann Paragas for salary differential, night shift differential, annual bonus and full attendance bonus. The complaint for unpaid monetary benefits is DISMISSED.\n\nAtty. Ricardo C.

NO. 144792, January 31, 2006 ]\n\nGAMMON PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. METRO RAIL TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N\nGAMMON PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. METRO RAIL TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nTINGA, J.:\n\nThe Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) was created in recognition of the construction industry's contribution to national development goals. Realizing that delays in the resolution of construction industry disputes would also hold up the country's development, Executive Order No. 1008 (EO 1008) expressly mandates the CIAC to expeditiously settle construction industry disputes and, for this purpose, vests upon the CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. Ironically, the instant challenge to the CIAC's jurisdiction has spawned the very delay which the law has envisioned to forestall.\n\nGammon Philippines, Inc. (Gammon) assails the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 54922 which ordered the CIAC to desist for lack of jurisdiction from hearing Gammon's claim for reimbursement against Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation (MRTDC) without prejudice to its right to file an appropriate action in the proper court.\n\nThe following are the antecedents:\n\nIn 1996, MRTDC was awarded a government contract by way of a Build Lease and Transfer Agreement to undertake the MRT 3 North Triangle Development Project (Project). Among the major components of the Project was the construction of a four (4)-level podium superstructure.\n\nMRTDC, through its Project Manager, Parsons Inter Pro Joint Venture (Parsons), sent invitations to prospective bidders for the Project. Gammon submitted a bid to furnish all the materials, labor, tools, equipment, supervision, and other facilities to complete the works on the podium superstructure for the contract price of P1,401,672,095.00.\n\nOn August 27, 1997, Parsons issued a Letter of Award [also known as a Notice of Award (NOA)] and a Notice to Proceed (NTP) in favor of Gammon, notifying the latter of the award to it of the contract for the construction of the podium superstructure.\n\nShortly thereafter, MRTDC sent a letter to Gammon on September 12, 1997, notifying the latter of the suspension of all the undertakings stipulated in the August 27, 1997 NOA/NTP ostensibly because of the currency crisis at that time.\n\nAccording to Gammon, however, after the issuance of the August 27, 1997 NOA/NTP, it proceeded to de-water and clean up the Project site. On the other hand, MRTDC claims that before any construction activity could proceed, it formally served Gammon a notice confirming the \"temporary suspension of all requirements under the terms of the contract until such time as clarification of scope has been received from the owner. The only exception to this suspension is the re-design of the projects floor slabs and the site de-watering and clean up.\" [2]\n\nAs a result of its analysis of the impact of the currency crisis, MRTDC decided to downsize the podium structure to two (2) levels. Again, the parties are in disagreement whether bid proposals for the redesigned two-level podium were solicited. MRTDC claims that bidding took place, while Gammon insists that it merely submitted a proposal to undertake the redesigned Project and was issued a NOA/NTP on February 18, 1998. Gammon then submitted a proposal reducing the contract price from P1,401,672,095.00 to P1,062,988,607.00. This proposal was accepted by MRTDC for which it issued a NOA/NTP dated April 2, 1998.\n\nOn May 7, 1998, MRTDC rescinded the NOA/NTP dated April 2, 1998. In its place, MRTDC offered another NOA/NTP dated June 10, 1998 whose terms reduced the original construction period and increased the stipulated liquidated damages in case of delay. Gammon qualifiedly accepted the offer but manifested its willingness to consider revisions to the terms and conditions of the NOA/NTP.\n\nOn June 22, 1998, MRTDC notified Gammon that it was awarding the contract to Filipinas (Prefab Building) Systems, Inc. (Filsystems) since Gammon did not accept the terms and conditions of the June 10, 1998 NOA/NTP. Consequently, Gammon sought reimbursement of the direct and indirect costs it incurred in relation to the Project amounting to P118,391,218.43.\n\nMRTDC signified its willingness to reimburse Gammon but rejected the latter's computation and instead offered a fixed cap of five percent (5%) of Gammon's total claims, or approximately P6,000,000.00 only.\n\nDissatisfied with this figure, Gammon filed its claim with the CIAC invoking the arbitration clause of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) which provides that the arbitration of all disputes, claims or questions under the contract shall be in accordance with CIAC rules.\n\nOn July 26, 1999, the CIAC directed MRTDC \"to file the required Answer and nominees for the Arbitral Tribunal on or before August 7, 1999, otherwise, the arbitration will proceed in accordance with the CIAC Rules.\" [3] Instead of filing an Answer, however, MRTDC filed a Request for Production of Documents, claiming that its counsel did not find among the documents attached to the Notice of Claim \"any contract duly signed by claimant and respondent, much less an arbitration agreement between them, on the basis of which, this Honorable Commission can properly assume jurisdiction over this case.\" [4]\n\nThe CIAC issued another Order on August 4, 1999, directing Gammon \"to file its Comment (on the request)\u2014and/or produce the duly signed copies of the contract and agreement, and furnish copies thereof to Respondent.\" [5]\n\nGammon filed a Comment dated August 16, 1999, asking that MRTDC's request be denied on the grounds that: (1) the rules on discovery are not applicable to arbitration; (2) the request is premature because MRTDC has not filed its Answer; and (3) since MRTDC has its own records and files which are available to it, the request is not proper. [6]\n\nOn August 18, 1999, the CIAC rendered its assailed Order, [7] the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Commission's Order dated 4 August 1999 in so far (sic) as it directs Claimant to produce the duly signed contract and the agreement to arbitrate, is hereby SET ASIDE. Respondent is accordingly directed to submit within an INEXTENDIBLE period of ten (10) days from receipt hereof, its Answer and nominees for the Arbitral Tribunal. In default thereof, the Commission shall give due course to Claimant's Motion to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with its Rules and shall direct the Arbitrators so appointed to proceed with the arbitration and render judgment as the evidence presented may warrant.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8] The CIAC denied MRTDC's motion for reconsideration in its Order [9] dated September 2, 1999. Consequently, MRTDC questioned its jurisdiction to arbitrate in a petition for certiorari filed with the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn its assailed Decision, the appellate court ruled that the CIAC is without jurisdiction over the case because Gammon failed to present any valid and subsisting contract upon which the claim for arbitration may be based. According to the appellate court, the NOA/NTP dated August 27, 1997, upon which Gammon brought the claim for arbitration, had been novated by the NOA/NTP dated April 2, 1998. In turn, the NOA/NTP dated April 2, 1998 had been extinguished before construction could commence. Further, the NOA/NTP dated June 10, 1999 was a mere counter-offer which was only qualifiedly accepted by Gammon. Hence, there is no perfected contract between the parties which may be made the basis for arbitration.\n\nThe Court of Appeals denied Gammon's Motion for Reconsideration [10] in its Resolution [11] dated August 31, 2000.\n\nIn its Memorandum [12] dated May 29, 2001 filed before this Court, Gammon avers that the novation of the August 27, 1997 NOA/NTP cannot be used as basis for ruling that the CIAC has no jurisdiction over the dispute because novation was never raised as an issue by MRTDC, which did not even invoke novation as basis for assailing the orders of the CIAC. Further, Gammon maintains that the contract between the parties was not novated. This contract, designated as Contract No. 4.241.001, in fact, contemplates that changes could be made without novating or invalidating the contract. The redesign of the podium structure, with the concomitant reduction in the contract price therefor, is allegedly a mere minor modification which does not render the old obligation entirely incompatible with the new one.\n\nEven assuming that the contract between the parties had been extinguished by novation or rescission, Gammon asserts that the provision for arbitration in the contract survives and the CIAC's jurisdiction over the dispute remains unaffected.\n\nGammon also claims that MRTDC has no legal capacity to sue since it has not been incorporated under Philippine laws. Moreover, it allegedly cannot raise the issue that Gammon's claims for damages did not arise from a construction contract as this issue was neither raised before the CIAC nor before the Court of Appeals. Besides, Gammon does not claim damages incident to its participation in the bidding process but those incurred in the performance of the contract after the issuance of the NOA/NTP dated August 27, 1997.\n\nFor its part, MRTDC filed a Memorandum [13] dated May 29, 2001, contending that while novation was not directly raised as an issue in its petition before the Court of Appeals, the latter could not have avoided applying the law on novation in resolving the correctness of the CIAC's position that its jurisdiction over Gammon's claim was supported by its examination of the various NOA's/NTP's issued by MRTDC.\n\nMRTDC insists that the contract between the parties evidenced by the August 27, 1997 NOA/NTP was novated by the April 2, 1998 NOA/NTP because of the incompatibility between the two (2) contracts in terms of subject matter and price or consideration. In turn, the April 2, 1998 NOA/NTP was rescinded. On the other hand, the June 10, 1998 NOA/NTP did not materialize because MRTDC's offer was only qualifiedly accepted by Gammon.\n\nMRTDC further asserts that the cancellation of the main construction contract necessarily resulted in the extinguishment of the arbitration clause, which is a mere adjunct of the main contract.\n\nAs regards its alleged lack of personality to sue, MRTDC counters that Gammon has already admitted MRTDC's legal personality in its pleadings. Gammon allegedly can no longer take a position contrary to or inconsistent with the allegations in its own pleading. Besides, the corporate personality of MRTDC can only be assailed in a direct action.\n\nFinally, even admitting that the contract was not extinguished, MRTDC contends that Gammon's claims are not construction-related. Construction is defined as referring \"to all on-site work on buildings or altering structures from land clearance through completion including excavation, erection and assembly and installation of components and equipment.\" [14] Gammon's breakdown of its claims, consisting of mobilization and demobilization, engineering services, design work, site de-watering and clean-up, costs incurred as a direct result of suspension of work, lost profit and overhead expenses, cost of on-going discussions with owner, and attorney's fees, allegedly do not fall within the above-stated definition of construction as to be considered construction-related.\n\nAlthough there is considerable disagreement concerning the foregoing facts, specifically whether Gammon undertook certain works on the Project and whether a re-bidding for the downgraded podium structure was indeed conducted, the Court does not need to make its own factual findings before it can resolve the main question of whether the CIAC's jurisdiction was properly invoked. The resolution of this question necessarily involves a two-pronged analysis, first , of the requisites for invoking the jurisdiction of the CIAC, and second , of the scope of arbitrable issues covered by CIAC's jurisdiction.\n\nEO 1008 expressly vests in the CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from or connected with construction contracts entered into by parties that have agreed to submit their dispute to voluntary arbitration. It defines the jurisdiction of the body thus:\nSECTION 4. Jurisdiction.\u2014The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to violation of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of the terms of agreement; interpretation and/or application of contractual provisions; amount of damages and penalties; commencement time and delays; maintenance and defects; payment default of employer or contractor and changes in contract cost.\n\nExcluded from the coverage of this law are disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which shall continue to be covered by the Labor Code of the Philippines. In this case, the parties submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the CIAC by virtue of the arbitration clause in the GCC, which provides:\nArt. 33.05 ARBITRATION: All disputes, claims or questions subject to arbitration under this Contract shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\nNotice of the demand for arbitration of a dispute shall be filed in writing with the other party to the Contract, and a copy filed with the Project Management Team. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen; in no case however, shall the demand be made later than the time of final payment except as otherwise expressly stipulated in the Contract. Such arbitration shall be in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law of the Philippines and the Rules and Procedures Governing Construction Arbitration of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission of the Philippines. Any arbitration proceedings shall take place in the Philippines. MRTDC, however, contends that the contract between the parties was novated by subsequent NOA's/NTP's which changed the design of the podium structure and reduced the contract price.\n\nWe do not agree. Novation is defined as the extinguishment of an obligation by the substitution or change of the obligation by a subsequent one which terminates the first, either by changing the object or principal conditions; substituting the person of the debtor; or subrogating a third person in the rights of the creditor. [15] In order than an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitutes the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new obligations be on every point incompatible with each other. [16]\n\nNovation cannot be presumed. The animus novandi, whether partial or total, must appear by the express agreement of the parties, or by their acts that are too clear and unequivocal to be mistaken. [17] Further, novation may either be extinctive or modificatory. It is extinctive when an old obligation is terminated by the creation of a new one that takes the place of the former. It is merely modificatory when the old obligation subsists to the extent that it remains compatible with the amendatory agreement. [18]\n\nWe have carefully gone over the records of this case and are convinced that the redesign of the podium structure and the reduction in the contract price merely modified the contract. These modifications were even anticipated by the GCC as it expressly states that changes may be made on the works without invalidating the contract, thus:\n20.07 CHANGES IN THE WORK:\nCHANGES ORDERED BY OWNER: The Owner may at any time, without invalidating the Contract and without notice to the sureties, order extra work or make changes by altering, adding to or deducting from the work, as covered by the Drawings and Specifications of this Contract and within the general scope thereof. Such changes shall be ordered by the Project Management Team in writing, and no change or omission from the Drawings and Specifications shall be considered to have been authorized without written instructions signed by the Project Manager. By these terms, the parties evidently agreed that should changes need to be made on the Project plans, such changes shall not annul or extinguish the contract. Thus, it can fairly be concluded that the revisions in the design of the Project and the reduction of the contract price were intended to merely modify the agreement and not to supplant the same.\n\nParenthetically, while the NOA's/NTP's adverted to the execution of a formal contract for the Project, no such formal contract appears to have been executed. Instead, the NOA's/NTP's issued by MRTDC in favor of Gammon denominated the agreement as \"Contract No. 4.251.001 for the Construction and Development of the Superstructure MRT 3 North Triangle\" and consistently referred to the GCC as one of the controlling documents with regard to the transaction.\n\nIn fact, as mentioned by the CIAC in its assailed Order dated August 18, 1999, the NOA/NTP dated June 10, 1998 makes reference to the GCC. The June 10, 1998 NOA/NTP states:\nA formal contract for the Work is in process and will be available for signature as soon as possible. Pending the execution of the contract, the General conditions, and the Drawings and Specifications included with the Bid Documents (as originally issued and only as applicable to the current scope of work), all of which are incorporated herein by this reference, shall apply in this Notice. . . . [19] A similar reference to the GCC appears in the April 2, 1998 NOA/NTP. [20] Thus, even granting that, as the Court of Appeals ruled, the August 27, 1997 NOA/NTP had been novated by the April 2, 1998 NOA/NTP and that, in turn, the latter was rescinded by MRTDC, the arbitration clause in the GCC remained in force.\n\nAt any rate, the termination of the contract prior to a demand for arbitration will generally have no effect on such demand, provided that the dispute in question either arose out of the terms of the contract or arose when a broad contractual arbitration clause was still in effect. [21] The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in ruling that there must be a subsisting contract before the jurisdiction of the CIAC may properly be invoked. The jurisdiction of the CIAC is not over the contract but the disputes which arose therefrom, or are connected thereto, whether such disputes arose before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. [22]\n\nIt may even be added that issues regarding the rescission or termination of a construction contract are themselves considered arbitrable issues under Sec. 2, Art. IV of the Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration, the Rules which were in force at the time the present controversy arose. The provision states:\nSec. 2. Non-Arbitrable Issues \u2014Pursuant to Section 4 of Executive Order No. 1008, claims for moral damages, exemplary damages, opportunity/business losses in addition to liquidated damages, and attorney's fees are not arbitrable except when the parties acquiesce or mutually agree to submit the same for arbitration and to abide by the decision of the arbitrator thereon.\n\nClaims for unrealized expected profits (built-in in the contract price) and issues on rescission or termination of a contract, however, are arbitrable. This brings us to the question of whether the dispute in this case falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.\n\nRelevantly, while the above-quoted provision of the Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration lists as non-arbitrable issues claims for opportunity/business losses and attorney's fees, this provision was not carried over to the Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration which was approved on November 19, 2005. Such omission is not without good reason. EO 1008 itself excludes from the coverage of the law only those disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which are covered by the Labor Code, conveying an intention to encompass a broad range of arbitrable issues within the jurisdiction of the CIAC.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the GCC submits to the jurisdiction of the CIAC all disputes, claims or questions subject to arbitration under the contract. The language employed in the arbitration clause is such as to indicate the intent to include all controversies that may arise from the agreement as determined by the CIAC Rules. It is broad enough to encompass all issues save only those which EO 1008 itself excludes, i.e ., employer-employee relationship issues. Under these Rules, the amount of damages and penalties is a general category of arbitrable issues under which Gammon's claims may fall.\n\nFinally, the Court does not need to delve into the issue of MRTDC's legal capacity. Suffice it to state that Gammon is estopped from challenging MRTDC's alleged lack of capacity to sue after having acknowledged the latter's legal capacity by entering into a contract with it. [23]\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated April 25, 2000, as well as its Resolution dated August 31, 2000, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Said Decision and Resolution reversed and set aside the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 98, Quezon City, dated 03 January 1994.THE ANTECEDENTSThe instant cases had their beginnings in 1977 when the National Housing Authority (NHA) filed expropriation proceedings against the Zuzuarreguis, petitioners in G.R.

On 29 October 1984, a Partial Decision was rendered by Branch 141 in Civil Case No. 26804 fixing the just compensation to be paid to the Zuzuarreguis at P30.00 per square meter. The NHA filed a Motion for Reconsideration[9] dated 23 November 1984 praying that the Partial Decision be reconsidered and set aside, and a new one rendered lowering the amount of just compensation in accordance with applicable laws.

The Compromise Agreement, stipulated among other things, that the just compensation of the Zuzuarregui properties would be at P19.50 per square meter payable in NHA Bonds. In a Decision dated 20 December 1985, the RTC, Branch 141, Makati, approved the Compromise Agreement submitted by the parties.On 27 December 1985, the NHA Legal Department, through Atty. Jose B. H. Pedrosa, released to Atty. Romeo G. Roxas, in behalf of the Zuzuarreguis, the amount of P20,000,000.00 in NHA Bearer Bonds as \"partial payment for several parcels of land with a total area of 1,790,570.36 square meters located in Antipolo, Rizal.\"[14] On even date, Atty. Romeo G. Roxas delivered NHA Bonds to Antonio De Zuzuarregui in the amount of P15,000,000.00. [15] On 04 February 1986, the amount of P34,500,000.00 in Bearer Bonds was again released by the NHA to Atty. Romeo G. Roxas in behalf of the Zuzuarreguis.[16] On 14 February 1986, the Zuzuarreguis issued a receipt [17]for receiving the amount of P30,070,000.00. This receipt included the P15,000,000.00 given to them last 27 December 1985. Again on 17 February 1986, the Zuzuarreguis, through Beatriz Zuzuarregui vda. De Reyes, issued another receipt for the amount of P450,000.00 in NHA bonds.[18] The total amount in NHA bonds released to Atty. Romeo G. Roxas in behalf of the Zuzuarreguis amounted to P54,500,000.00. Out of this amount, the records show that the amount turned over to the Zuzuarreguis by Atty. Roxas amounted to P30,520,000.00 in NHA bonds.Computed at P19.50 per square meter, the 1,790,570.36 square meters property of the Zuzuarreguis was expropriated at a total price of P34,916,122.00. The total amount released by the NHA was P54,500,000.00. The difference of P19,583,878.00 is, undoubtedly, the yield on the bonds.On 25 August 1987, a letter [19] was sent by the Zuzuarreguis' new counsel, Jose F. Gonzalez, to Attys. Roxas and Pastor, demanding that the latter deliver to the Zuzuarreguis the yield corresponding to bonds paid by the NHA within a period of 10 days from receipt, under pain of administrative, civil and/or criminal action.Attys. Roxas and Pastor answered via a letter dated 21 September 1987 explaining their side of the story. They stated therein, among other things, that the amount that they got seems huge from the surface, but it just actually passed their hands, as it did not really go to them.[20]On 29 September 1987, a letter [21] was sent by the Zuzuarreguis through Antonio De Zuzuarregui, Jr., to Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago N. Pastor, informing the latter that their services as counsels of the Zuzuarreguis (except Betty) in the expropriation proceedings filed by the NHA, docketed as Civil Case No. 26804, was being formally terminated.Apparently unsatisfied with the explanation of Attys. Roxas and Pastor, the Zuzuarreguis filed a civil action for Sum of Money and Damages on 14 November 1989 before the RTC, Quezon City, Branch 98, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-89-4013, against the NHA, Jose B. H. Pedrosa, Atty. Romeo G. Roxas and Atty. Santiago N. Pastor. The Zuzuarreguis demanded that the yield on the NHA bonds be turned over to them.After due hearing, a Decision [22] in Civil Case No. Q-89-4013 was rendered on 03 January 1994, dismissing the Complaint. The dispositive portion reads:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration[s], judgment is hereby rendered ordering the dismissal of the complaint against all the defendants; and, further ordering plaintiffs, jointly and solidarily, to: Pay each of the defendants Romeo G. Roxas, Santiago Pastor and Jose B. H. Perdosa, the amount of P200,000.00, P200,000.00 and P100,000.00, respectively, as moral damages; Pay each of the defendants Roxas, Pastor and Pedrosa, the amount of P50,000.00, P50,000.00, and P25,000.00, respectively as exemplary damages; Pay attorney's fees to defendants Roxas and Pastor in the amount of P20,000.00; and Pay the costs of this suit.A Notice of Appeal[23] dated 10 February 1994 was filed by the Zuzuarreguis. Subsequently, on 26 April 1995, the Zuzuarreguis filed their appeal brief with the Court of Appeals. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 45732.A Decision[24] was eventually promulgated by the Fifteenth Division of the Court of Appeals on 25 June 2001, reversing and setting aside the ruling of Branch 98, viz:Therefore, We find that the amount of P4,476,426.275 is, in the opinion of this Court, commensurate to the services rendered by defendants-appellees. This amount has been arrived at by giving to defendants-appellees P2.50 per square meter of the 1,790,570.51 square meter expropriated properties of herein plaintiffs-appellants.WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision dated January 3, 1994 of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 98, Quezon City in Civil Case No. 89-4013 entitled \"Antonio Zuzuarregui, Jr., et al. versus National Housing Authority, et al.\" for \"Sum of Money and Damages,\" is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Defendants-Appellees Roxas and Pastor are hereby ordered to return to plaintiffs-appellants the amount of P12,596,696.425, the balance from the P17,073,122.70, received as yield from NHA bonds after deducting the reasonable attorney's fees in the amount of P4,476,426.275[25]Attys. Roxas and Pastor filed a Motion for Reconsideration[26] on 25 July 2001. The Zuzuarreguis also filed a Motion for Reconsideration [27] on 30 July 2001, not having been satisfied with the award, while the NHA and Pedrosa filed their Motions for Reconsideration [28] on 03 August 2001.In a Resolution dated 06 February 2002, the Court of Appeals denied for lack of merit all the Motions for Reconsideration.On 05 March 2002, Attys. Roxas and Pastor filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [29] assailing the Decision of the Court of Appeals, docketed as G.R. No. 152072. Likewise, on 21 March 2002, the Zuzuarreguis filed their own Petition for Review on Certiorari[30] assailing the same Decision, docketed as G.R. No. 152104.ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORSAttys. Roxas and Pastor, petitioners in G.R. No. 152072, assign as errors the following:ITHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN HOLDING THAT THE LETTER-AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 10, 1985 CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO STAND AS THE LAW BETWEEN THE PARTIES; andIITHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN HOLDING THAT DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS, HEREIN PETITIONERS, CONCEALED TO THE PLAINTIFFS-APPELLEES, HEREIN RESPONDENTS, THE YIELD OF THE NHA BONDS[31]The Zuzuarreguis, petitioners in G.R. No. 152101, on the other hand, assign as errors the following:ITHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AWARDING TO PETITIONERS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ONLY P12,596,696.425 AND NOT P17,073,122.70 MAKING A DIFFERENCE OF P4,476,426.28IITHE RESPONDENTS SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR INTEREST FROM THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT UNTIL FULLY PAIDIIITHE RESPONDENTS SHOULD BE HELD LIABE FOR MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEESIVTHE RESPONDENTS NHA AND JOSE B.H. PEDROSA ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE WITH RESPONDENTS ROXAS AND PASTOR[32]ISSUE FOR RESOLUTIONDrawn from the above assignment of errors, it is patent that the principal issue that must be addressed by this Court is:WHETHER OR NOT THE LETTER-AGREEMENT DATED 10 DECEMBER 1985, EXECUTED BY THE ZUZUARREGUIS, AND ATTYS. ROXAS AND PASTOR, FIXING THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT MUST GO TO THE FORMER, SHOULD STAND AS LAW BETWEEN THE PARTIES.THE COURT'S RULINGAttys. Roxas and Pastor, petitioners in G.R. No. 152072, contend in the main that the Zuzuarreguis are only entitled to the amount of P17.00 per square meter for the 1,790,570.36 square meters expropriated by the government. This was, according to them, embodied in the Letter-Agreement dated 10 December 1985, wherein the Zuzuarreguis agreed to accept the price of P17.00 per square meter. Besides, Attys. Roxas and Pastor contend that the price of P17.00 was even way above the P11.00 that the Zuzuarreguis were willing to accept for their properties under the Letter of Engagement executed by the parties earlier on 22 April 1983. Computed at P17.00 per square meter, they stress that the amount that should go to the Zuzuarreguis for their 1,790,570.36 square meters property should be P30,439,696.10, and that in fact the Zuzuarreguis have received P30,520,000.00. The Letter-Agreement dated 10 December 1985 should thus stand as law between the parties. Since this Letter-Agreement, which was \"as plain and simple as can be such that there is no need for any further construction,\" already fixed the amount that would go to the Zuzuarreguis (P17.00 per square meter), then it should be so. Attys. Roxas and Pastor further assert that the receipts issued by the Zuzuarreguis dated 14 February 1986 and 17 February 1986 indicated that the amounts received by the latter were in \"full and final payment\" for the subject properties.The NHA, for its part, insists that there was no conspiracy between Attys. Roxas and Pastor on the one hand, and the NHA and Atty. Pedrosa on the other, on the application of yields from NHA bonds.[33] The Zuzuarreguis, according to the NHA, \"miserably failed to substantiate and establish conspiracy\" between them.The Zuzuarreguis, for their part, though they were triumphant in the Court of Appeals, insist that the amounts awarded them were not enough. According to them, the P12,596,696.425 awarded by the Court of Appeals was not correct. They should have been awarded the amount of P17,073,122.70. Quoting the Zuzuarreguis:Respondents Roxas and Pastor retained for themselves the amount of P3,980,000.00 which represented the agreed attorney's fees of Roxas and Pastor at P2.50 per square meter. The amount of P20,000,000.00 representing the yield of all the bearer bonds was, in the words of the Court of Appeals, \"deliberately hidden\" by respondents Roxas and Pastor from petitioners. By mathematical computation, the P20,000,000.00 yield should be proportionately divided at the ratio of P17.00 (petitioners') and P2.50 (share of respondents Roxas and Pastor). Following this ratio of division, of the P20,000,000.00 yield, P17,073,122.70 should pertain to petitioners and the balance of P2,926,877.30 to respondents Roxas and Pastor. Add this amount to the total of P3,980,000.00 at the agreed rate of P2.50 per square meter, the total attorney's fees of respondents Roxas and Pastor should be P6,906,877.30, not bad, again in the words of the Court of Appeals, for handling \"a simple expropriation case which ended up in a compromise agreement.\" It was, therefore, in error to still deduct the amount of P4,476,426.28 from petitioners share in the yield in the amount of P17,073,122.70 leaving then only P12,596,696.42.What was done, however, is that the product of 1,790,570.36 sq m. (area of the expropriated land of petitioners) and P2.50 which is 4,476,426.28 was again deducted from the P17,073,122.70 which is the corresponding share of the petitioners out of the total yield of P20,000,000.00. If this were a criminal case, petitioners were being sentenced twice for the same offense.[34]The Zuzuarreguis further insist that legal interest on the amount of P17,073,122.70 be imposed from the date of the filing of the complaint, including moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.We sustain the Court of Appeals, but with modification in the computation.A contract is a meeting of the minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service.[35] Contracts shall be obligatory, in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present.[36]Under Article 1318 of the Civil Code, there are three essential requisites which must concur in order to give rise to a binding contract: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation which is established.[37]All these requisites were present in the execution of the Letter-Agreement. Consent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract.[38] The Zuzuarreguis, in entering into the Letter-Agreement, fully gave their consent thereto. In fact, it was them (the Zuzuarreguis) who sent the said letter to Attys. Roxas and Pastor, for the purpose of confirming all the matters which they had agreed upon previously. There is absolutely no evidence to show that anybody was forced into entering into the Letter-Agreement. Verily, its existence, due execution and contents were admitted by the Zuzuarreguis themselves.[39]The second requisite is the object certain. The objects in this case are twofold. One is the money that will go to the Zuzuarreguis (P17.00 per square meter), and two, the money that will go to Attys. Roxas and Pastor (any and all amount in excess of P17.00 per square meter). There was certainty as to the amount that will go to the Zuzuarreguis, and there was likewise certainty as to what amount will go to Attys. Roxas and Pastor.The cause is the legal service that was provided by Attys. Roxas and Pastor. In general, cause is the why of the contract or the essential reason which moves the contracting parties to enter into the contract.[40]It is basic that a contract is the law between the parties.[41] Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith. Unless the stipulations in a contract are contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy, the same are binding as between the parties.[42] In Licudan v. Court of Appeals,[43] we did not allow the Contract for Professional Services between the counsel and his client to stand as the law between them as the stipulation for the lawyer's compensation was unconscionable and unreasonable. We said:Although the Contract for Professional Services dated August 30, 1979 was apparently voluntarily signed by the late Aurelio Licudan for himself and on behalf of his daughter, petitioner Cristina Licudan-Campos and by the petitioner Wilfredo Licudan who both manifested in open court that they gave their free and willing consent to the said contract, we cannot allow the said contract to stand as the law between the parties involved considering that the rule that in the presence of a contract for professional services duly executed by the parties thereto, the same becomes the law between the said parties is not absolute but admits an exception \u2013 that the stipulations therein are not contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy or public order.[44]Under the contract in question, Attys. Roxas and Pastor are to receive contingent fees[45] for their professional services. It is a deeply-rooted rule that contingent fees are not per se prohibited by law. They are sanctioned by Canon 13 of the Canons of Professional Ethics, viz:13. Contingent Fees. \u2013A contract for contingent fee, where sanctioned by law, should be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case including the risk and uncertainty of the compensation, but should always be subject to the supervision of a court, as to its reasonableness.and Canon 20, Rule 20.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, [46] viz:CANON 20 \u2013 A LAWYER SHALL CHARGE ONLY FAIR AND REASONABLE FEES.Rule 20.01. \u2013 A lawyer shall be guided by the following factors in determining his fees:(a) The time spent and the extent of the services rendered or required;(b) The novelty and difficulty of the question involved;(c) The importance of the subject matter;(d) The skill demanded;(e) The probability of losing other employment as a result of acceptance of the proffered case;(f) The customary charges for similar services and the schedule of fees of the IBP chapter to which he belongs;(g) The amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the client from the service;(h) The contingency or certainty of compensation;(i) The character of the employment, whether occasional or established; and(j) The professional standing of the lawyer.However, in cases where contingent fees are sanctioned by law, the same should be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case, and should always be subject to the supervision of a court, as to its reasonableness, [47] such that under Canon 20 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, a lawyer is tasked to charge only fair and reasonable fees. Indubitably entwined with the lawyer's duty to charge only reasonable fees is the power of this Court to reduce the amount of attorney's fees if the same is excessive and unconscionable.[48] Thus, Section 24, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court partly states: SEC. 24. Compensation of attorneys; agreement as to fees. \u2013 An attorney shall be entitled to have and recover from his client no more than a reasonable compensation for his services, with a view to the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the extent of the services rendered, and the professional standing of the attorney. x x x. A written contract for services shall control the amount to be paid therefore unless found by the court to be unconscionable or unreasonable.Attorney's fees are unconscionable if they affront one's sense of justice, decency or reasonableness.[49]]It becomes axiomatic therefore, that power to determine the reasonableness or the, unconscionable character of attorney's fees stipulated by the parties is a matter falling within the regulatory prerogative of the courts.[50] In the instant case, Attys. Roxas and Pastor received an amount which was equal to forty-four percent (44%) of the just compensation paid (including the yield on the bonds) by the NHA to the Zuzuarreguis, or an amount equivalent to P23,980,000.00 of the P54,500,000.00. Considering that there was no full blown hearing in the expropriation case, ending as it did in a Compromise Agreement, the 44% is, undeniably, unconscionable and excessive under the circumstances. Its reduction is, therefore, in order. This is in accordance with our ruling in the earlier case of Tanhueco v. De Dumo[51], where we reduced the amount of attorney's fees from sixty percent (60%) to fifteen percent (15%), for being excessive and unreasonable.It is imperative that the contingent fees received by Attys. Roxas and Pastor must be equitably reduced. In the opinion of this Court, the yield that corresponds to the percentage share of the Zuzuarreguis in the P19.50 per square meter just compensation paid by the NHA must be returned by Attys. Roxas and Pastor.The yield on the NHA bonds amounted to P19,583,878.00. This amount must therefore be divided between the Zuzuarreguis, on the one hand, and Attys. Roxas and Pastor, on the other. The division must be pro rata. The amount of P17.00 that should go to the Zuzuarreguis represents 87.18% of the P19.50 per square meter just compensation, The P2.50 per square meter that was to go to Attys. Roxas and Pastor, on the other hand, represents 12.82%.The Zuzuarreguis are entitled to the yield equal to 87.18% of the P19,583,878.00, while Attys. Roxas and Pastor are entitled to 12.82% of said amount. The amount corresponding to 87.17% of P19,583,878.00 is P17,073,224.84. This is the yield that the Zuzuarreguis are entitled to. Attys. Roxas and Pastor, on the other hand, are entitled to P2,510,653.16.Attys. Roxas and Pastor, in the opinion of this Court, were not shortchanged for their efforts for they would still be earning or actually earned attorney's fees in the amount of P6,987,078.75 (P4,476,425.59 + P2,510,653.16).The amount of P17,073,224.84 must therefore be returned by Attys. Roxas and Pastor to the Zuzuarreguis. They can take this out from the yield in the amount of P19,583,878.00 which they have appropriated for themselves.On the issue of moral and exemplary damages, we cannot award the same for there was no direct showing of bad faith on the part of Attys. Roxas and Pastor, for as we said earlier, contingency fees are not per se prohibited by law. It is only necessary that it be reduced when excessive and unconscionable, which we have already done.We likewise cannot hold the NHA and Atty. Pedrosa jointly and severally liable to the Zuzuarreguis for there is no evidence to show conspiracy between them.WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 25 June 2001 and 06 February 2002, respectively, are AFFIRMED but with the MODIFICATION that Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago N. Pastor are hereby ordered to return to the Zuzuarreguis the amount of P17,073,224.84.

The petitioners in G.R. No. 152072, Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago N. Pastor, seek the reversal and annulment of the Decision [ 3] and Resolution [ 4] of the Court of Appeals dated 25 June 2001 and 06 February 2002, respectively. The petitioners in G.R. No. 152104, the Zuzuarreguis, on the other hand, pray that the said Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals be modified. Said Decision and Resolution reversed and set aside the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 98, Quezon City, dated 03 January 1994.\n\nTHE ANTECEDENTS\n\nThe instant cases had their beginnings in 1977 when the National Housing Authority (NHA) filed expropriation proceedings against the Zuzuarreguis, petitioners in G.R. No. 152104, for parcels of land belonging to the latter situated in Antipolo, Rizal, with a total land area of 1,790,570.36 square meters, more or less. This case was lodged before the RTC, Branch 141, Municipality of Makati, [ 5] docketed therein as Civil Case No. 26804 entitled, \"National Housing Authority v. Pilar Iba\u00f1ez Vda. De Zuzuarregui, et al.\"\n\nOn 25 May 1983, said case was ordered archived [ 6 ] by Branch 141.\n\nAbout a month before the aforecited case was ordered archived, the Zuzuarreguis engaged the legal services of Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago N. Pastor, to represent them in Civil Case No. 26804. This was sealed by a Letter-Agreement dated 22 April 1983, which is partly reproduced hereunder:\n\nApril 22, 1983\nMr. Antonio de Zuzuarregui, Jr.\nMrs. Pacita Javier (as heir to\nthe late Jose de Zuzuarregui)\nMr. Antonio de Zuzuarregui ( as heir to\nthe late Pilar Y. vda.

De\nZuzuarregui As heir to the late\nJose De Zuzuarregui [7] A Motion to Set Case for Hearing, [ 8] dated 14 February 1984, was filed by Attys. Roxas and Pastor in Civil Case No. 26804, praying that the case be revived and be set for hearing by the court at the earliest date available in its calendar.\n\nThe appropriate proceedings thereafter ensued. On 29 October 1984, a Partial Decision was rendered by Branch 141 in Civil Case No. 26804 fixing the just compensation to be paid to the Zuzuarreguis at P30.00 per square meter.\n\nThe NHA filed a Motion for Reconsideration [ 9] dated 23 November 1984 praying that the Partial Decision be reconsidered and set aside, and a new one rendered lowering the amount of just compensation in accordance with applicable laws. Pending resolution thereof, a Joint Special Power of Attorney was executed by Antonio De Zuzuarregui, Jr., Enrique De Zuzuarregui and Pacita Javier, in favor of Attys. Roxas and Pastor, viz:\n\nJOINT SPECIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:\n\nThat We, ANTONIO DE ZUZUARREGUI, JR., ENRIQUE DE ZUZUARREGUI and PACITA JAVIER, all of legal age, ..., do hereby appoint, name and constitute ATTYS.

(Sgd.) BEATRIZ ZUZUARREGUI\nVDA. DE REYES [1 1]\n\nOn 10 December 1985, a Letter-Agreement was executed by and between Antonio Zuzuarregui, Jr., Pacita Javier and Enrique De Zuzuarregui, on the one hand, and Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago Pastor, on the other. The said Letter-Agreement reads:\nDecember 10, 1985\n\nAtty. Romeo G. Roxas\nAtty.

PASTOR[12]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(Sgd.) (Sgd.) ANTONIO DE ZUZUARREGUI, JR. PACITA JAVIER In my behalf and as heir to\nThe late Pilar Y. vda. De\nZuzuarregui As heir to the late\nJose De Zuzuarregui\n\n(Sgd.) ENRIQUE DE ZUZUARREGUI\n\nCONFORME:\n\n(Sgd.) (Sgd.) ATTY. ROMEO G. ROXAS ATTY. SANTIAGO N. PASTOR [12] Resolution No. 1174 [13] dated 16 December 1985 was issued by the NHA stating that the Zuzuarregui property would be acquired at a cost of P19.50 per square meter; that the Zuzuarreguis would be paid in NHA Bonds, subject to the availability of funds; and that the yield on the bonds to be paid to the Zuzuarreguis shall be based on the Central Bank rate at the time of payment.\n\nAs a result of the aforesaid NHA Resolution, a Compromise Agreement was executed between the Zuzuarreguis and the NHA in Civil Case No. 26804. The Compromise Agreement, stipulated among other things, that the just compensation of the Zuzuarregui properties would be at P19.50 per square meter payable in NHA Bonds. In a Decision dated 20 December 1985, the RTC, Branch 141, Makati, approved the Compromise Agreement submitted by the parties.\n\nOn 27 December 1985, the NHA Legal Department, through Atty. Jose B. H. Pedrosa, released to Atty. Romeo G. Roxas, in behalf of the Zuzuarreguis, the amount of P20,000,000.00 in NHA Bearer Bonds as \"partial payment for several parcels of land with a total area of 1,790,570.36 square meters located in Antipolo, Rizal.\" [14] On even date, Atty. Romeo G. Roxas delivered NHA Bonds to Antonio De Zuzuarregui in the amount of P15,000,000.00. [15] On 04 February 1986, the amount of P34,500,000.00 in Bearer Bonds was again released by the NHA to Atty. Romeo G. Roxas in behalf of the Zuzuarreguis. [16] On 14 February 1986, the Zuzuarreguis issued a receipt [17] for receiving the amount of P30,070,000.00. This receipt included the P15,000,000.00 given to them last 27 December 1985. Again on 17 February 1986, the Zuzuarreguis, through Beatriz Zuzuarregui vda. De Reyes, issued another receipt for the amount of P450,000.00 in NHA bonds. [18] The total amount in NHA bonds released to Atty. Romeo G. Roxas in behalf of the Zuzuarreguis amounted to P54,500,000.00. Out of this amount, the records show that the amount turned over to the Zuzuarreguis by Atty. Roxas amounted to P30,520,000.00 in NHA bonds.\n\nComputed at P19.50 per square meter, the 1,790,570.36 square meters property of the Zuzuarreguis was expropriated at a total price of P34,916,122.00. The total amount released by the NHA was P54,500,000.00. The difference of P19,583,878.00 is, undoubtedly, the yield on the bonds.\n\nOn 25 August 1987, a letter [19] was sent by the Zuzuarreguis' new counsel, Jose F. Gonzalez, to Attys. Roxas and Pastor, demanding that the latter deliver to the Zuzuarreguis the yield corresponding to bonds paid by the NHA within a period of 10 days from receipt, under pain of administrative, civil and/or criminal action.\n\nAttys. Roxas and Pastor answered via a letter dated 21 September 1987 explaining their side of the story. They stated therein, among other things, that the amount that they got seems huge from the surface, but it just actually passed their hands, as it did not really go to them. [20]\n\nOn 29 September 1987, a letter [21] was sent by the Zuzuarreguis through Antonio De Zuzuarregui, Jr., to Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago N. Pastor, informing the latter that their services as counsels of the Zuzuarreguis (except Betty) in the expropriation proceedings filed by the NHA, docketed as Civil Case No. 26804, was being formally terminated.\n\nApparently unsatisfied with the explanation of Attys. Roxas and Pastor, the Zuzuarreguis filed a civil action for Sum of Money and Damages on 14 November 1989 before the RTC, Quezon City, Branch 98, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-89-4013, against the NHA, Jose B. H. Pedrosa, Atty. Romeo G. Roxas and Atty. Santiago N. Pastor. The Zuzuarreguis demanded that the yield on the NHA bonds be turned over to them.\n\nAfter due hearing, a Decision [22] in Civil Case No. Q-89-4013 was rendered on 03 January 1994, dismissing the Complaint. The dispositive portion reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration[ s], judgment is hereby rendered ordering the dismissal of the complaint against all the defendants; and, further ordering plaintiffs, jointly and solidarily, to:\nPay each of the defendants Romeo G. Roxas, Santiago Pastor and Jose B. H. Perdosa, the amount of P200,000.00, P200,000.00 and P100,000.00, respectively, as moral damages;\n\nPay each of the defendants Roxas, Pastor and Pedrosa, the amount of P50,000.00, P50,000.00, and P25,000.00, respectively as exemplary damages;\n\nPay attorney's fees to defendants Roxas and Pastor in the amount of P20,000.00; and\n\nPay the costs of this suit. A Notice of Appeal [23] dated 10 February 1994 was filed by the Zuzuarreguis. Subsequently, on 26 April 1995, the Zuzuarreguis filed their appeal brief with the Court of Appeals. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 45732.\n\nA Decision [24] was eventually promulgated by the Fifteenth Division of the Court of Appeals on 25 June 2001, reversing and setting aside the ruling of Branch 98, viz:\nTherefore, We find that the amount of P4,476,426.275 is, in the opinion of this Court, commensurate to the services rendered by defendants-appellees. This amount has been arrived at by giving to defendants-appellees P2.50 per square meter of the 1,790,570.51 square meter expropriated properties of herein plaintiffs-appellants.\nWHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision dated January 3, 1994 of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 98, Quezon City in Civil Case No. 89-4013 entitled \"Antonio Zuzuarregui, Jr., et al. versus National Housing Authority, et al.\" for \"Sum of Money and Damages,\" is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Defendants-Appellees Roxas and Pastor are hereby ordered to return to plaintiffs-appellants the amount of P12,596,696.425, the balance from the P17,073,122.70, received as yield from NHA bonds after deducting the reasonable attorney's fees in the amount of P4,476,426.275 [25]\n\nAttys. Roxas and Pastor filed a Motion for Reconsideration [26] on 25 July 2001. The Zuzuarreguis also filed a Motion for Reconsideration [27] on 30 July 2001, not having been satisfied with the award, while the NHA and Pedrosa filed their Motions for Reconsideration [28] on 03 August 2001.\n\nIn a Resolution dated 06 February 2002, the Court of Appeals denied for lack of merit all the Motions for Reconsideration.\n\nOn 05 March 2002, Attys. Roxas and Pastor filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [29] assailing the Decision of the Court of Appeals, docketed as G.R. No. 152072. Likewise, on 21 March 2002, the Zuzuarreguis filed their own Petition for Review on Certiorari [30] assailing the same Decision, docketed as G.R. No. 152104.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS\n\nAttys. Roxas and Pastor, petitioners in G.R. No. 152072, assign as errors the following:\n\nI\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN HOLDING THAT THE LETTER-AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 10, 1985 CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO STAND AS THE LAW BETWEEN THE PARTIES; and II\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN HOLDING THAT DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS, HEREIN PETITIONERS, CONCEALED TO THE PLAINTIFFS-APPELLEES, HEREIN RESPONDENTS, THE YIELD OF THE NHA BONDS [31] The Zuzuarreguis, petitioners in G.R. No. 152101, on the other hand, assign as errors the following:\n\nI\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AWARDING TO PETITIONERS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ONLY P12,596,696.425 AND NOT P17,073,122.70 MAKING A DIFFERENCE OF P4,476,426.28 II\nTHE RESPONDENTS SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR INTEREST FROM THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT UNTIL FULLY PAID III\nTHE RESPONDENTS SHOULD BE HELD LIABE FOR MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IV\nTHE RESPONDENTS NHA AND JOSE B.H. PEDROSA ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE WITH RESPONDENTS ROXAS AND PASTOR [32] ISSUE FOR RESOLUTION\n\nDrawn from the above assignment of errors, it is patent that the principal issue that must be addressed by this Court is:\nWHETHER OR NOT THE LETTER-AGREEMENT DATED 10 DECEMBER 1985, EXECUTED BY THE ZUZUARREGUIS, AND ATTYS. ROXAS AND PASTOR, FIXING THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT MUST GO TO THE FORMER, SHOULD STAND AS LAW BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE COURT'S RULING\n\nAttys. Roxas and Pastor, petitioners in G.R. No. 152072, contend in the main that the Zuzuarreguis are only entitled to the amount of P17.00 per square meter for the 1,790,570.36 square meters expropriated by the government. This was, according to them, embodied in the Letter-Agreement dated 10 December 1985, wherein the Zuzuarreguis agreed to accept the price of P17.00 per square meter. Besides, Attys. Roxas and Pastor contend that the price of P17.00 was even way above the P11.00 that the Zuzuarreguis were willing to accept for their properties under the Letter of Engagement executed by the parties earlier on 22 April 1983. Computed at P17.00 per square meter, they stress that the amount that should go to the Zuzuarreguis for their 1,790,570.36 square meters property should be P30,439,696.10, and that in fact the Zuzuarreguis have received P30,520,000.00. The Letter-Agreement dated 10 December 1985 should thus stand as law between the parties. Since this Letter-Agreement, which was \"as plain and simple as can be such that there is no need for any further construction,\" already fixed the amount that would go to the Zuzuarreguis (P17.00 per square meter), then it should be so.\n\nAttys. Roxas and Pastor further assert that the receipts issued by the Zuzuarreguis dated 14 February 1986 and 17 February 1986 indicated that the amounts received by the latter were in \"full and final payment\" for the subject properties.\n\nThe NHA, for its part, insists that there was no conspiracy between Attys. Roxas and Pastor on the one hand, and the NHA and Atty. Pedrosa on the other, on the application of yields from NHA bonds. [33] The Zuzuarreguis, according to the NHA, \"miserably failed to substantiate and establish conspiracy\" between them.\n\nThe Zuzuarreguis, for their part, though they were triumphant in the Court of Appeals, insist that the amounts awarded them were not enough. According to them, the P12,596,696.425 awarded by the Court of Appeals was not correct. They should have been awarded the amount of P17,073,122.70. Quoting the Zuzuarreguis:\nRespondents Roxas and Pastor retained for themselves the amount of P3,980,000.00 which represented the agreed attorney's fees of Roxas and Pastor at P2.50 per square meter. The amount of P20,000,000.00 representing the yield of all the bearer bonds was, in the words of the Court of Appeals, \"deliberately hidden\" by respondents Roxas and Pastor from petitioners. By mathematical computation, the P20,000,000.00 yield should be proportionately divided at the ratio of P17.00 (petitioners') and P2.50 (share of respondents Roxas and Pastor). Following this ratio of division, of the P20,000,000.00 yield, P17,073,122.70 should pertain to petitioners and the balance of P2,926,877.30 to respondents Roxas and Pastor. Add this amount to the total of P3,980,000.00 at the agreed rate of P2.50 per square meter, the total attorney's fees of respondents Roxas and Pastor should be P6,906,877.30, not bad, again in the words of the Court of Appeals, for handling \"a simple expropriation case which ended up in a compromise agreement.\" It was, therefore, in error to still deduct the amount of P4,476,426.28 from petitioners share in the yield in the amount of P17,073,122.70 leaving then only P12,596,696.42.\n\nWhat was done, however, is that the product of 1,790,570.36 sq m. (area of the expropriated land of petitioners) and P2.50 which is 4,476,426.28 was again deducted from the P17,073,122.70 which is the corresponding share of the petitioners out of the total yield of P20,000,000.00. If this were a criminal case, petitioners were being sentenced twice for the same offense. [34] The Zuzuarreguis further insist that legal interest on the amount of P17,073,122.70 be imposed from the date of the filing of the complaint, including moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.\n\nWe sustain the Court of Appeals, but with modification in the computation.\n\nA contract is a meeting of the minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service. [35] Contracts shall be obligatory, in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present. [36]\n\nUnder Article 1318 of the Civil Code, there are three essential requisites which must concur in order to give rise to a binding contract: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation which is established. [37]\n\nAll these requisites were present in the execution of the Letter-Agreement.\n\nConsent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. [38] The Zuzuarreguis, in entering into the Letter-Agreement, fully gave their consent thereto. In fact, it was them (the Zuzuarreguis) who sent the said letter to Attys. Roxas and Pastor, for the purpose of confirming all the matters which they had agreed upon previously. There is absolutely no evidence to show that anybody was forced into entering into the Letter-Agreement. Verily, its existence, due execution and contents were admitted by the Zuzuarreguis themselves. [39]\n\nThe second requisite is the object certain. The objects in this case are twofold. One is the money that will go to the Zuzuarreguis (P17.00 per square meter), and two, the money that will go to Attys. Roxas and Pastor (any and all amount in excess of P17.00 per square meter). There was certainty as to the amount that will go to the Zuzuarreguis, and there was likewise certainty as to what amount will go to Attys. Roxas and Pastor.\n\nThe cause is the legal service that was provided by Attys. Roxas and Pastor. In general, cause is the why of the contract or the essential reason which moves the contracting parties to enter into the contract. [40]\n\nIt is basic that a contract is the law between the parties. [41] Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith. Unless the stipulations in a contract are contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy, the same are binding as between the parties. [42]\n\nIn Licudan v. Court of Appeals, [43] we did not allow the Contract for Professional Services between the counsel and his client to stand as the law between them as the stipulation for the lawyer's compensation was unconscionable and unreasonable. We said:\nAlthough the Contract for Professional Services dated August 30, 1979 was apparently voluntarily signed by the late Aurelio Licudan for himself and on behalf of his daughter, petitioner Cristina Licudan-Campos and by the petitioner Wilfredo Licudan who both manifested in open court that they gave their free and willing consent to the said contract, we cannot allow the said contract to stand as the law between the parties involved considering that the rule that in the presence of a contract for professional services duly executed by the parties thereto, the same becomes the law between the said parties is not absolute but admits an exception \u2013 that the stipulations therein are not contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy or public order. [44] Under the contract in question, Attys. Roxas and Pastor are to receive contingent fees [45] for their professional services. It is a deeply-rooted rule that contingent fees are not per se prohibited by law. They are sanctioned by Canon 13 of the Canons of Professional Ethics, viz:\n13. Contingent Fees. \u2013 A contract for contingent fee, where sanctioned by law, should be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case including the risk and uncertainty of the compensation, but should always be subject to the supervision of a court, as to its reasonableness. and Canon 20, Rule 20.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, [46] viz :\nCANON 20 \u2013 A LAWYER SHALL CHARGE ONLY FAIR AND REASONABLE FEES.\n\nRule 20.01. \u2013 A lawyer shall be guided by the following factors in determining his fees:\n\n(a) The time spent and the extent of the services rendered or required;\n(b) The novelty and difficulty of the question involved;\n(c) The importance of the subject matter;\n(d) The skill demanded;\n(e) The probability of losing other employment as a result of acceptance of the proffered case;\n(f) The customary charges for similar services and the schedule of fees of the IBP chapter to which he belongs;\n(g) The amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the client from the service;\n(h) The contingency or certainty of compensation;\n(i) The character of the employment, whether occasional or established; and\n(j) The professional standing of the lawyer. However, in cases where contingent fees are sanctioned by law, the same should be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case, and should always be subject to the supervision of a court, as to its reasonableness, [47] such that under Canon 20 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, a lawyer is tasked to charge only fair and reasonable fees.\n\nIndubitably entwined with the lawyer's duty to charge only reasonable fees is the power of this Court to reduce the amount of attorney's fees if the same is excessive and unconscionable. [48] Thus, Section 24, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court partly states:\nSEC. 24. Compensation of attorneys; agreement as to fees . \u2013 An attorney shall be entitled to have and recover from his client no more than a reasonable compensation for his services, with a view to the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the extent of the services rendered, and the professional standing of the attorney. x x x. A written contract for services shall control the amount to be paid therefore unless found by the court to be unconscionable or unreasonable. Attorney's fees are unconscionable if they affront one's sense of justice, decency or reasonableness. [49] ] It becomes axiomatic therefore, that power to determine the reasonableness or the, unconscionable character of attorney's fees stipulated by the parties is a matter falling within the regulatory prerogative of the courts. [50]\n\nIn the instant case, Attys. Roxas and Pastor received an amount which was equal to forty-four percent (44%) of the just compensation paid (including the yield on the bonds) by the NHA to the Zuzuarreguis, or an amount equivalent to P23,980,000.00 of the P54,500,000.00. Considering that there was no full blown hearing in the expropriation case, ending as it did in a Compromise Agreement, the 44% is, undeniably, unconscionable and excessive under the circumstances. Its reduction is, therefore, in order. This is in accordance with our ruling in the earlier case of Tanhueco v. De Dumo [51] , where we reduced the amount of attorney's fees from sixty percent (60%) to fifteen percent (15%), for being excessive and unreasonable.\n\nIt is imperative that the contingent fees received by Attys. Roxas and Pastor must be equitably reduced. In the opinion of this Court, the yield that corresponds to the percentage share of the Zuzuarreguis in the P19.50 per square meter just compensation paid by the NHA must be returned by Attys. Roxas and Pastor.\n\nThe yield on the NHA bonds amounted to P19,583,878.00. This amount must therefore be divided between the Zuzuarreguis, on the one hand, and Attys. Roxas and Pastor, on the other. The division must be pro rata. The amount of P17.00 that should go to the Zuzuarreguis represents 87.18% of the P19.50 per square meter just compensation, The P2.50 per square meter that was to go to Attys. Roxas and Pastor, on the other hand, represents 12.82%.\n\nThe Zuzuarreguis are entitled to the yield equal to 87.18% of the P19,583,878.00, while Attys. Roxas and Pastor are entitled to 12.82% of said amount. The amount corresponding to 87.17% of P19,583,878.00 is P17,073,224.84. This is the yield that the Zuzuarreguis are entitled to. Attys. Roxas and Pastor, on the other hand, are entitled to P2,510,653.16.\n\nAttys. Roxas and Pastor, in the opinion of this Court, were not shortchanged for their efforts for they would still be earning or actually earned attorney's fees in the amount of P6,987,078.75 (P4,476,425.59 + P2,510,653.16).\n\nThe amount of P17,073,224.84 must therefore be returned by Attys. Roxas and Pastor to the Zuzuarreguis. They can take this out from the yield in the amount of P19,583,878.00 which they have appropriated for themselves.\n\nOn the issue of moral and exemplary damages, we cannot award the same for there was no direct showing of bad faith on the part of Attys. Roxas and Pastor, for as we said earlier, contingency fees are not per se prohibited by law. It is only necessary that it be reduced when excessive and unconscionable, which we have already done.\n\nWe likewise cannot hold the NHA and Atty. Pedrosa jointly and severally liable to the Zuzuarreguis for there is no evidence to show conspiracy between them.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 25 June 2001 and 06 February 2002, respectively, are AFFIRMED but with the MODIFICATION that Attys. Romeo G. Roxas and Santiago N. Pastor are hereby ordered to return to the Zuzuarreguis the amount of P17,073,224.84.

CAUGMA, AMIANA ABELLA AND ROSAURO MARTINEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE SANDIGANBAYAN,RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCALLEJO, SR., J.:\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of the Decision [1] of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 17001 convicting the four accused therein of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as well as its Resolution [2] denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.\n\nUnder Executive Order (E.O.) No. 888 dated March 18, 1983, ministers and heads of government agencies were authorized to dispose of their unserviceable equipment and disposable property through the creation of a Disposal Committee (Committee) composed of a representative of the owning ministry or agency as chairperson, and, as members, representatives of the Bureau of Supply Coordination and the Commission on Audit (COA). The committee had the following functions:\n(1) Inspect or authorize the field officer to inspect the unserviceable equipment and property to verify justification for disposal;\n\n(2) Set the final appraised value of all disposable property considering obsolescence, market demand, physical condition and result of previous biddings for similar property;\n\n(3) Recommend to the Minister or Head of Ministry/Agency for approval the manner of disposal taking into consideration the pertinent provisions of the Revised Administrative Code and the National Auditing Code;\n\n(4) Conduct public biddings for the sale or disposable property on an \"AS IS,\" \"WHERE IS\" basis and to recommend the corresponding award;\n\n(5) The representatives of the Commission on Audit and the Bureau of Supply Coordination together with the COA Technical Staff specifically assigned to the Disposal Committee, shall be clothed with full authority to make final decisions in behalf of their respective offices in the various committee deliberations;\n\n(6) In the case of agencies attached to certain Ministries, recommendations of the Disposal Committee is subject to the final approval of the Minister concerned. [3]\nE.O. No. 888 also provided that the unserviceable equipment may be disposed of by sale through public bidding and that their appraised value (as determined by the Committee) shall be the minimum selling price. Should the sale through public bidding be unsuccessful, the Committee was authorized to dispose of the property in any manner deemed advantageous to the government, including through barter or negotiated sale at no less than the Committee's appraised value.\n\nPursuant to E.O. No. 888, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) created its own committee under Office Order No. 65 dated May 8, 1983. Among the committee members were Marietta T. Caugma, Chief of the Finance Division as chairperson; Amiana M. Abella, vice-chairperson; Rosauro M. Martinez, BFAR Representative as member; Villa J. Bernaldo, COA Auditor/Representative as member; and Meynardo Geralde, Jr., Supply Coordination Office representative, as member.\n\nWay back in December 1959, the BFAR had acquired eight vessels from Japan under the RP-Japan Reparation Commission Agreement, among them the \" M/V Malasugui.\" In 1974 to 1980, the deteriorating vessel was dry-docked for extensive repairs, and thereafter was no longer utilized for test fishing activities. [4]\n\nThus, in a Comment Slip [5] dated April 18, 1984, Arsenio S. De Jesus, Chief of the Technological Services Division, informed BFAR Director Felix R. Gonzales that it was time to \"condemn the vessel due to old age (27 years).\"\n\nOn July 18, 1984, the vessel sustained leaks on her forward hull while docked at Pier 4, Fishing Port, Navotas, Metro Manila, flooding the engine room, fish holder and gear locker rooms. The BFAR engaged the services of V/L Shipyard Corporation (Corporation) to tow the vessel from the Navotas pier.\n\nThe Corporation billed the BFAR for berthing fees at P110.90 a day from September 11, 1984 to December 31, 1984 in the total amount of P12,420.00, [6] and for security services, tonnage, electrical power for water supply, gasoline and other vessel services in the amount of P21,037.00, or the total amount of P33,457.80 via Bill No. 1529 [7] dated January 3, 1985. Gonzales approved the claim and Caugma certified the availability of funds for the disbursement via Disbursement Voucher [8] dated January 28, 1985, subject to release of funds from the Ministry of Budget and Management.\n\nIn a Memorandum [9] dated July 20, 1984, Officer-in-Charge Eriberto A. Macatangay of the Fishing Boat Operations Section recommended to the Bureau Director that the vessel should be disposed of considering that it could no longer serve its purpose due to \"old age and deteriorating superstructure.\" In a Memorandum [10] dated November 13, 1984, the captain of the vessel also recommended that the vessel be disposed/condemned to save funds which would have to be spent for repair and berthing fees. An Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property [11] was prepared, declaring that the vessel was obsolete, \"junk or scrap,\" and that to maintain it was no longer economical. The report was signed by the Bureau Director, a COA representative and Arsenio S. De Jesus, Chief, Technological Services Division. The report was transmitted to the Director of the Supply Coordination Office of the General Services Administration (GSA) for appropriate action. [12]\n\nIn a Memorandum [13] dated April 29, 1985 signed by De Jesus, COA representative Jaoquin C. Lim and Supply Coordination Office representative Meynardo L. Garalde, Jr. it was reported to the GSA that the fishing vessel was obsolete, unserviceable and beyond economical repair, and that spare parts were no longer available. The appraised value of the vessel was declared at P86,917.60. It was recommended that the vessel be sold through public bidding for not lower than P86,000.00; that in addition, the awardee/buyer shall pay all the charges in connection with the sale of the property; and that the vessel be disposed immediately to avoid further depreciation in value, \"considering that it [was] berthed/docked in a private firm.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on November 8, 1985, the Corporation billed the BFAR for berthing fees at P110.90 a day from January 1, 1985 to October 31, 1985 totaling P33,457.80; and for security services, electrical power, shifting of vessel with the use of a tugboat, fresh water supply and gasoline, and other services amounting to P25,940.00. The total charges amounted to P69,653.60. [14]\n\nOn November 11, 1985, the Disposal Committee submitted its Report [15] on the appraisal of the vessel, recommending that it be sold at public auction at the appraised value of P86,917.60, including the charges of the sale. The Committee also prepared the Procedural Guidelines [16] to be followed relative to the sale. These were transmitted to Bureau Director Gonzales on November 11, 1985. [17]\n\nOn November 12, 1985, Gonzales issued an Invitation to Bid [18] which also contained the conditions of the sale of the vessel. He revised the proposed procedural guidelines of the Committee (Condition No. 8 of the Invitation to Bid) to provide that the \" bidder agrees to pay, in addition to the award price, taxes, duties and other costs such as berthing fees, cost of publication of the bid, etc. and levies which may be imposed by law. \" [19] Prospective bidders were required to submit their sealed bids not later than 10:00 a.m. on November 21, 1985, at which time the bids would be opened publicly as required by Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. The bid offer was also required to be accompanied by cash or manager's check in an amount equivalent to 10% percent of the offer to guarantee the bid, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the sale, and later converted as downpayment in case of a winning bidder. Bids which did not meet the full consideration or requirements of the BFAR would be considered defective, and only those deemed advantageous to the government would be accepted. The sale of the vessel would be awarded to the highest bidder who would pay the bid price within 10 days from notice of the award.\n\nThe invitation to bid was published in the Times Journal for three consecutive days from November 14 to 15, 1985. [20] The publisher billed the BFAR P2,400.00 as publication fee on November 16, 1985. [21]\n\nThe public bidding was held on November 21, 1985. [22] There were four bidders but only two participated: Dr. Enrique Peras, Jr. for the All Point Trading and General Services Corporation, and Eddie S. Galler, Jr., General Manager of the Corporation. Galler, Jr. submitted the bid, as well as copies of Invoice Nos. 1529 and 1589 showing that the Corporation had billed the Bureau the total amount of P103,111.40 for various services rendered on the vessel. Dr. Peras, Jr. inquired what were included as \"berthing fees\" under Condition No. 8 in the invitation to bid, and Caugma replied that the fees included those due after the publication of the invitation to bid up to the final award of the sale of the vessel. [23] Galler, Jr. asked if the P103,111.40 under Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589 issued by the Corporation would be included in the bid price, and Caugma replied that the Committee would study the matter. [24] At that time, the Committee had no knowledge of the berthing fees and other charges incurred from November 1, 1985 up to the final award. [25]\n\nThe Committee, however, agreed that the bid for the vessel should be stated separately from berthing and publication fees which should be broken down. [26] Galler, Jr. withdrew the bid of the Corporation. The Committee resolved to reset the opening of the bids at 10:00 a.m. of November 28, 1985. Upon the suggestion of Bernaldo, the notice of public bidding was posted in public places. [27]\n\nOn November 28, 1985, the Committee met for the re-scheduled public bidding. Bernaldo was substituted by Marlene Nacua of the COA. There were five registered bidders but only two appeared. The Corporation submitted its sealed bid - P13,890.00 or 10% of its bid price as required by the invitation to bid. The other registered bidders left without submitting any bid.\n\nCaugma asked the committee members if the lone bid of the Corporation could already be opened and they all agreed. Nacua did not interpose any objection because she believed in good faith that it was in accordance with COA rules and regulations. Caugma opened the bid and receipted the P13,890.00 representing 10% of the bid price of P138,900.00, broken down as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\na) | PUBLICATION FEE | P 2,400.00\nb) | BERTHING FEE | 103,111.40\nc) | BFAR | 33,388.60\n | Total | P138,900.00[28]\n[END_TABLE]\n\na) PUBLICATION FEE P 2,400.00 b) BERTHING FEE 103,111.40 c) BFAR 33,388.60\nTotal P138,900.00 [28]\nBelieving that the bid price for the vessel was P138,900.00 and that this amount surpassed the appraised value of P86,917.60, the Committee members resolved to recommend to the Bureau Director that the sale of the vessel be awarded to the Corporation for final approval. The Committee transmitted its recommendation to the Bureau Director, including the minutes of the meeting. Upon the suggestion of Amiana Abella, the Committee sent a letter to the corporation confirming that its bill for costs and berthing fees would be the last it would receive. [29]\n\nMeanwhile, Gonzales approved Disbursement Voucher No. 101-85-12-19-9042 [30] dated December 5, 1985 amounting to P69,653.60 in favor the Corporation. Caugma certified that the amount was available for the purpose, but payment was held in abeyance pending the release of the final award to be made by the Ministry of Budget and Management.\n\nOn December 23, 1985, Gonzales transmitted a letter [31] to the Minister of Agriculture and Food requesting for authority to award the sale of the \" M/V Malasugui \" to the Corporation. He stated that of the five registered bidders, only the Corporation had submitted its bid of P138,900.00, which included the cost of publication, berthing fees, and the appraised value of the vessel. He appended to the letter the lone Minutes of the Public Bidding held on November 28, 1985 as well as the submitted bid. The Assistant Minister, Aurora B. Marcos, referred the matter to the Resident Auditor for study and recommendation. [32] Then Ministry Auditor Reynaldo Ventura informed the Minister that he had no objection to award to the Corporation the sale of the fishing vessel, considering that the bid it submitted was higher than the appraised value. [33] He required, however, that the proposed sale be given wide publication, and that the proceeds of the sale be accounted for as income and be remitted to the National Treasury.\n\nIn light of this favorable report, the Minister of Agriculture and Food, through Assistant Minister Marcos, authorized the Bureau Director to award and sell the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00, pursuant to Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445, and Section 3, paragraph 3 of E.O. No. 888. [34]\n\nMeanwhile, on January 6, 1986, the BFAR remitted to the Corporation the amount of P69,653.60 in payment of Bill No. 1589. Galler, Jr. issued Receipt No. 256 for the said amount. [35]\n\nOn February 10, 1986, the BFAR, through Gonzales, awarded the sale of the \" M/V Malasugui\" to the Corporation and requested it to remit the amount of P138,900.00 in payment thereof. [36] The BFAR delivered juridical possession of the vessel to the Corporation on February 27, 1986. [37] On February 28, 1986, the Corporation remitted P138,900.00 as full payment of the vessel for which it was issued Official Receipt No. 2861007. [38] The amount was deposited in the National Treasury on March 5, 1986. [39] Thereafter, the BFAR released to the Corporation its bid bond of P13,890.00.\n\nOn April 25, 1986, Caugma approved the change of entry in the book of accounts of the BFAR and credited P138,900.00 to it. [40]\n\nHowever, on May 5, 1986, Antonio B. Baltazar, a former BFAR Chief Technologist who was separated from government service on September 19, 1975, filed a Complaint-Affidavit [41] with the Ombudsman against Director Felix Gonzales for negligence under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code on July 17, 1984 for the leaks of the vessel while berthed at Navotas, Metro Manila. Baltazar claimed, among others, that Gonzales had failed to file an insurance claim on the vessel from the Government Service Insurance System. The matter was referred to the COA.\n\nMeanwhile, on May 12, 1986, the National Treasurer remitted P33,457.80 to the Corporation [42] as full payment for berthing fees and other services per Invoice No. 1529 and Disbursement Voucher dated January 28, 1985. [43]\n\nOn June 5, 1986, the Regional Director of the COA directed Villa Bernaldo (then BFAR Auditor) to conduct a discreet inquiry regarding Baltazar's complaint. [44] Bernaldo submitted her report on June 18, 1986, where she declared that the Corporation submitted its P138,900.00 bid, broken down as follows: publication fee, P2,400.00; berthing fee, P103,111.40; charges on the BFAR, P33,388.60; or a total of P138,900.00. [45] According to Bernaldo, the berthing fee represented the amount BFAR billed the Corporation for dry-docking costs, and that this expense was included as one of the findings in the 1985 Annual Audit Report of the BFAR because it was incurred mainly due to the delay in the disposal of the \" M/V Malasugui .\" She concluded that the appraised value of P86,917.60 was therefore, not met, but the fees incurred in connection with the disposal were included in the bid offer of P138,900.00 and was accepted by the Bureau. She admitted, however, that the amount of P138,900.00 had been fully accounted for, receipted under O.R. No. 2861007 dated March 4, 1986 and deposited as income in the National Treasury on March 5, 1986 . [46]\n\nBaltazar thereafter filed a Manifestation [47] with the Ombudsman requesting the inclusion of Caugma, Abella, Bernaldo, and Martinez as respondents.\n\nThe Ombusman required the Committee members to submit their counter-affidavits. In their Joint Counter-Affidavit and Rejoinder Affidavit, [48] they declared inter alia that the bidding and sale of the vessel was made in accordance with law, as well as accounting and auditing rules and regulations. After the requisite preliminary investigation, Special Prosecution Officer Robert E. Kallos issued a Resolution [49] dated July 24, 1992, recommending that the charges against Gonzales and Bernaldo be dropped; Gonzales acted in good faith, while Bernaldo was not present when the actual bidding was conducted.\n\nThereafter, the Ombudsman filed an Information charging Eddie S. Galler, Jr., Marietta Caugma, Amiana Abella and Rosauro Martinez of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The accusatory portion of the information reads:\nThat in or about and during the period from November 21, 1985 to November 28, 1985 and/or prior or subsequent thereto in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Marietta T. Caugma, Amiana Abella and Rosauro Martinez, all public officers being then the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and member respectively, of the Disposal Committee of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), while in the discharge/exercise of their official administrative functions conspiring and confederating with accused EDUARDO S. GALLER, JR., a private individual and representative of V.L. Shipyard of Navotas, did then and there willfully and unlawfully through evident bad faith cause undue injury to the BFAR/Government by then and there proceeding with a public bidding for the disposal of BFAR' fishing vessel M/V Malasugui held on November 28, 1985 when only EDDIE S. GALLER, JR. was present and submitted his bid and thereafter accused public officers acted favorably on the itemized bid offer of EDDIE S. GALLER, JR. in spite of their knowledge that said bid offer is in violation of condition no. 8 of the Invitation to Bid and that the BFAR/Government will only get the amount of THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT PESOS AND SIXTY CENTAVOS (P33,388.60), Philippines (sic) Currency, which is very much below the Appraised value of M/V Malasugui in the amount of P86,917.60, thereby causing damage or injury to the BFAR/Government in the sum of P53,529.00.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [50]\nOn reinvestigation, the Ombudsman denied the recommendation of Special Prosecutor Reynaldo A. Alhambra to withdraw the Information for being unsupported by evidence. [51]\n\nTo prove the guilt of all the accused, the prosecution relied on the testimony of the BFAR Resident Auditors Bernaldo and Nacua. Bernaldo declared that she was present during the initial public bidding on November 21, 1985. However, during the public bidding on November 28, 1985, the COA was represented by Nacua. She claimed that the second bidding should not have proceeded because the lone bidder offered to purchase the vessel for only P33,388.60 instead of its appraised value as required by Section 6, paragraph 1 of E.O. No. 888. [52] She further declared that to comply with E.O. No. 888, the minimum acceptable selling price was P190,000.00 broken down as follows: P2,400.00 for publication fee; berthing fee of P103,111.40; and P86,917.60 for the appraised value of the vessel. [53] Considering that this bid price was not reached after the second bid, the Committee should have declared a failure of bid, hence, per COA regulations, the vessel should have been sold through negotiation for a price to be fixed by the Commission. [54]\n\nIn response to the clarificatory question of the Presiding Justice, Bernaldo declared that the transactions relative to the sale of the vessel were in order. [55] She also affirmed the contents of petitioners' Joint Affidavit and Rejoinder Joint Affidavit. Nacua, for her part, declared that the public auction/bidding was done in accordance with pertinent laws and COA rules and regulations.\n\nCaugma adduced testimonial and documentary evidence that as early as January 3, 1985, the Corporation had billed the BFAR for services rendered on the vessel after the July 18, 1984 incident, per Invoice No. 1529 for the amount of P33,457.80. The BFAR prepared and issued a Disbursement Voucher on January 28, 1985. [56] The funding of the disbursement was released by the Ministry (now Department) of Budget and Management only on March 4, 1986 under CDC B-0141-86-1-022. The Treasurer of the Philippines paid the amount to the Corporation on May 12, 1986, per PNB Check No. SN-5-7994745-4 for P33,457.00. [57] She clarified that the P69,653.60 paid to the Corporation per Invoice Receipt No. 1589 dated November 8, 1985 was for mooring and berthing services, as well as part of the security services at the water front, electric supply, tug services from January 1, 1985 up to October 31, 1985, and other services provided to the vessel from January 1, 1985 to September 15, 1985. The payment of these bills to the Corporation was approved by no less than Villa Bernaldo, BFAR resident auditor. [58] The two obligations of the BFAR totaling P103,111.40 were separate and valid obligations of BFAR which should not have been deducted from the proceeds of the sale to the winning bidder. [59]\n\nCaugma further declared that on November 21, 1985, she explained to Galler, Jr. and Dr. Peras that the berthing fees referred to in the Invitation to Bid were those due from the publication of the Invitation to Bid up to the final award. The berthing fees from January 1, 1984 to October 31, 1985 were not for the account of the bidder. When she asked Galler, Jr. if the Corporation was waiving the publication fees and berthing fees from the time the invitation to bid was published up to the final award, Galler, Jr. agreed.\n\nGaller, Jr. adopted the evidence of Caugma. He testified that he was the Marketing Manager of the Corporation, and that he had not met the Committee members before the public bidding on November 21, 1985. [60] At that time, the purchase price of the vessel had not yet been fixed. [61] He presented the two bills of the Corporation - one for services, and another for berthing fees up to October 31, 1985 totaling P103,111.40. At the time, the Corporation had not yet presented its bill for berthing fees and various services from November 13, 1985 to November 21, 1985. His impression was that since the vessel was being sold on an \"as is where is\" basis, the other charges were not part of the bid and had to be separately paid. As far as he knew, the only interest of the BFAR was to recover the value of the vessel. [62] He waived the berthing fees due from the publication of the Invitation to Bid until the final award. [63] On November 28, 1985, he submitted the sealed bid of the Corporation which he signed upon the request of the Corporation's president. [64] The net bid price of the Corporation for the vessel was P138,900.00, [65] but he could not recall whether this bid had been broken down because it was prepared by one of the staff, which he signed before submission to the Committee. The amount of P103,111.40 in his bid included the berthing fees of P46,000.00 and for miscellaneous services for the vessel. [66] He felt that the P103,111.40, the amount the BFAR owed the Corporation for services rendered on the vessel, was a reasonable price, but the Corporation still submitted its bid to purchase it for P138,900.00 because it could repair the vessel at the least price. [67]\n\nOn July 29, 2004, the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment [68] convicting the four (4) accused of the crime charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Marietta T. Caugma, Amiana Abella, Rosauro Martinez and Eduardo S. Galler, Jr., GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019 and are hereby sentenced to each suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum to fifteen (15) years as maximum and to each suffer the penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office.\n\nSO ORDERED . [69]\nThe Sandiganbayan ruled that, under Condition No. 8 of the invitation to bid, only those bidders who had agreed to pay no less than the appraised value of the vessel, P86,917.60, excluding taxes, duties and other costs (such as berthing fees, publication of the bid and levies which may be imposed by law), should have been considered by the Committee. Caugma was aware of this condition in the invitation to bid, as evidenced by the minutes of the bidding held on November 21, 1985. She even explained the conditions of the sale to the bidders then present. The Sandiganbayan further declared that Caugma had knowledge of the fact that the berthing fee was P103,111.40 since it was clearly indicated in the invitation to bid. Thus, in evident bad faith, the accused conspired together and awarded the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00, of which only P33,388.60 would be remitted to the BFAR. It also held that Committee members Abella and\n\nMartinez took active part in the public bidding and, as evidenced by the Minutes of the Meeting, favored the Corporation.\n\nThe Sandiganbayan concluded that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Disposal Committee gave unwarranted advantage and preference to Galler, Jr., causing injury to the government to the extent of P53,529.00; after deducting the publication fee of P2,400.00 and the berthing fee of P103,111.40, the government realized only the net amount of P33,388.60, short by P53,529.00 of the appraisal value of the vessel, P86,917.60.\n\nPetitioners moved for the reconsideration of the decision, which the graft court denied on January 26, 2005. [70]\n\nHence, petitioners filed the instant petition seeking the reversal of the Sandiganbayan's ruling on the following claims: (1) they were denied their right to equal protection of the law; and (2) the prosecution failed to prove that they acted in evident bad faith in awarding the sale of the vessel to the Corporation and that the BFAR suffered damage/injury in the amount of P53,529.00.\n\nPetitioners aver that the Committee complied with the requirements of E.O. No. 888 and of Fisheries Order No. 65, Series of 1983 relative to the sale of the fishing vessel. They maintain that their recommendation to accept the subject bid was in order, as even the BFAR Director concurred therein and transmitted a letter-request to the Minister of Agriculture and Food for authority to award the sale to the lone bidder; in turn, the Ministry Auditor interposed no objection as the said bid was higher than the vessel's appraised value. Petitioners point out that no less than the Assistant Minister concurred with the Resident Auditor to the Committee's recommendation.\n\nPetitioners likewise posit that the conditions set forth in the invitation to bid were complied with. They maintain that the Committee's determination of the award is merely recommendatory and is not in itself a contract. Thus, the BFAR Director and the Assistant Minister should be charged and prosecuted for violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 considering that under E.O. No. 888, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food has the sole authority to dispose of the vessel. They point out that ultimately, it was the Ministry that sold the vessel to the Corporation. Since the BFAR Director and the Minister were not prosecuted, they (petitioners) should not have been charged and prosecuted for the sale of the vessel to the Corporation, otherwise their right to the equal protection of the law would be violated.\n\nPetitioners further aver that the prosecution failed to prove that they acted in evident bad faith and that the government sustained undue injury. They insist that the bid price of the fishing vessel was P138,900.00, not merely P33,388.60. Petitioners aver that this can be gleaned from the testimony of Bernaldo and Galler, Jr. The costs referred to in Condition No. 8 of the Condition of Sale pertained to all charges in connection with the sale of the vessel and were to be paid by the bidder, not as part of but in addition to the bid price of P138,900.00. The fact that BFAR owed to the Corporation has no relevance to the public bidding, as the obligation of BFAR in the amount of P103,111.40 is separate and distinct from the Corporation's bid of P138,900.00. Petitioners point out that the amount of P138,900.00 was paid to the national treasury. Even assuming that the government sustained a loss of P53,529.00, they should not be the ones held liable therefor.\n\nThe Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), for its part, avers that petitioners' contention that their role in the public bidding was recommendatory in nature is baseless; such argument was proffered in order to evade responsibility for the unjust and disadvantageous sale which prejudiced the interest of the government. The subsequent issuance by the BFAR Director of the certificate of award to the winning bidder is only a formality. What consummates the sale is the Committee's declaration of the winning bidder. When a qualified bidder is declared as such, it follows that such winning bidder will be awarded the contract or certificate of award; otherwise, taking part in the said bidding would be a meaningless exercise.\n\nThe OSP maintains that when the subject fishing vessel was advertised for sale, the act of selling the property had begun as there was already an offer. After complying with the requirements on publication and invitation to bid, the Committee proceeded with the sale and the Corporation was declared the winning bidder. The contract was perfected at that moment, as there was already a meeting of the minds between the seller and the buyer. The Bureau Director's subsequent issuance of the Certificate of Award did not affect the contract which had already been perfected and consummated in the first place through the Committee's actuations. Besides, the OSP asserts, the corresponding certificate of award would not have been issued had not the Committee declared the Corporation as the winning bidder. Thus, it was the Committee that conducted the sale and subsequently disposed of the fishing vessel in favor of said Corporation.\n\nAccording to the OSP, \"what is certain is that the public bidding was in fact a feigned, orchestrated and bogus one designed to prejudice the government, and this was known to petitioners before the bidding started.\" It argued further argued that:\nThe appraised value of M/V Malasugui was P86,917.60 as reported to by the Disposal Committee. V/L Shipyard Corporation offered a bid in the amount of P133,900.00 (sic). In its application, V/L Shipyard broke down the items to constitute the amount of P133,900.00 (sic) as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nPublication fee | P 2,400.00\nBerthing fee | 103,111.40\nBFAR | 33,388.60\n[END_TABLE]\n\nPublication fee P 2,400.00 Berthing fee 103,111.40 BFAR 33,388.60\nWhen the Disposal Committee published its Invitation to Bid, it was specific in one of its condition that \" \"(t)he bidder agrees to pay in addition to the award, price, taxes, duties and other costs such as berthing fees, cost of publication of the bid, etc. and levies which may be imposed by law.\"\n\nIt was a matter of fact that BFAR owed V/L Shipyard Corporation an amount of P103,111.40, as berthing fee, for [dry-docking] M/V Malasugui at its property. After deducting the said amount together with P2,400.00 for the cost of the publication of the bid from the bid proposal in the amount of P138,900.00, the amount of P33,388.60 was arrived at. And this amount of P33,388.60 will go to BFAR as itemized by V/L Shipyard ahead when it posted its bid for M/V Malasugui. To reiterate, the bid proposal of V/L Shipyard was included in the Invitation to Bid of BFAR. Clearly, the government lost an amount of P53,529.00. x x x\n\nxxxx\n\nIn reality what was paid by V/L Shipyard Corporation for M/V Malasugui to BFAR was only P33,388.60, short of P53,529.00 from the appraised value of P86,917.60. The damage cost to the government was not merely negligible but more than substantial.\n\nFrom the foregoing, all the elements of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019 were present, and thus, the conviction of all the petitioners, together with Eddie Galler, Jr. is correct. [71]\nIn their Reply, petitioners reiterate that their determination as Committee members was merely recommendatory and subject to the final approval of the Minister of Agriculture and Food as provided in Section 6 of E.O. No. 888.\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nUnder the Constitution, accusation is not synonymous with guilt. In a criminal case, the accused is presumed innocent. It is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused for the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt. His freedom is forfeited only if the requisite quantum of proof necessary for conviction exists. The accused is even obliged to offer evidence in his behalf. The proof against him must survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to become a summary judgment. The conscience must be satisfied that on the accused could be laid the responsibility for the offense charged in that not only did he perpetrate the act but that it amounted to a crime. It is required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into account. [72] Thus, the burden of proof never shifts to the accused .\n\nSection 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 provides:\n(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.\n\nThe essential elements of violation of the provision are as follows:\nThe accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions;\n\nHe must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or inexcusable negligence; and\n\nThat his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions. [73] It must be stressed that mere bad faith is not enough for one to be liable under the law, since the act of bad faith must in the first place be evident. [74] Elaborating on the meaning of evident bad faith, this Court held in Marcelo v. Sandiganbayan : [75]\nBad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud. ( Spiegel v. Beacon Participations, 8 NE 2 nd Series, 895, 1007). It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill will for ulterior purposes. ( Air France v. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155, 166-167). Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage.\nUndue injury has been interpreted as synonymous to actual damages which is akin to that in civil law. [76 The prosecution is burdened to prove the factual basis and amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable by the injured party. [77] Courts cannot simply rely on speculations, conjectures or guesswork in determining the fact and the amount of damages. [78]\n\nConspiracy or collusion by and among public officers, inter se, and via private individuals to commit the crime under Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 must likewise be proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. This was the ruling of the Court in Desierto v. Ocampo : [79]\nCollusion implies a secret understanding whereby one party plays into another's hands for fraudulent purposes. It may take place between and every contractor resulting in no competition, in which case, the government may declare a failure of bidding. Collusion may also ensue between contractors and the chairman and members of the PBAC to simulate or rig the bidding process, thus insuring the award to a favored bidder, to the prejudice of the government agency and public service. For such acts of the chairman and the members of the PBAC, they may be held administratively liable for conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the government service. Collusion by and among the members of the PBAC and/or contractors submitting their bids may be determined from their collective acts or omissions before, during and after the bidding process. The complainants are burdened to prove such collusion by clear and convincing evidence because if so proved, the responsible officials may be dismissed from the government service or meted severe administrative sanctions for dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the government service.\nTo prove the guilt of petitioners for the crime charged, the prosecution presented COA Auditors Nacua and Bernaldo, and the report prepared by the latter dated June 18, 1986. However, contrary to petitioners' stance, the collective testimonies of the witnesses tend to exculpate petitioners.\n\nIn her Report, Bernaldo declared that the Corporation's bid for the vessel was only P33,388.60, P53,529.00 short of the threshold minimum price of P86,917.60, as provided in Condition No. 8 of the Invitation to Bid:\n8. That the bidder agrees to pay in addition to the award price, taxes, duties and other costs such as berthing fees, cost of publication of the bid, etc. and levies which may be imposed by law. [80]\nBernaldo testified that the Corporation's bid indicated the amount of P103,111.40, its claim for berthing fees and for various services rendered for the vessel from September 11, 1984 to October 31, 1985 under Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589, and that such expenses should be deducted from its bid of P138,900.00. She maintained that a qualified bidder should have submitted a bid not lower than P192,529.60. Bernaldo concluded that the Corporation submitted a bid of only P33,388.00, P53,529.00 short of a threshold minimum bid for the vessel; hence, the government lost P53,529.00 in the sale of the vessel. However, in the Joint Affidavit [81] submitted to the Ombudsman, petitioners, including Bernaldo, categorically declared that the bid price of the Corporation was P138,900.00, and that such bid was higher than the appraised value of the vessel amounting to P86,917.60. Bernaldo declared that the P138,900.00 was fully accounted for under O.R. No. 2861007 dated March 4, 1986, and deposited as income in the national treasury on March 5, 1986. Petitioners and Bernaldo maintained that the sale of the vessel was made in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations of the government . Bernaldo was as adamant as petitioners when they declared in their Rejoinder Joint Affidavit [82] submitted to the Ombudsman that the disposition of the vessel was made strictly in accordance with the law, rules and regulations of the government on the disposition of government property:\n6. That the obligations under Bill No. 1529 in the amount of P33,457.00 dated January 3, 1985 for services rendered in 1984 by the [V/L] Shipyard Corporation, was noted and approved for payment by the Bureau Resident Auditor and requested for the revalidation by the Bureau with the Department of Budget and Management and a corresponding funding was released by the said Department of Budget and Management under CDC No. B-0141-86-1-022 dated March 4, 1986.\n\nThe obligation under Bill No. 1589 dated November 8, 1985 in the amount of P69,653.60 were services rendered by the [V/L] Shipyard Corporation in the form of mooring on berthing fee, including share on security services at water front, supply of electrical power and four units light bulbs during night time, from January 1, 1985 up to October 31, 1985; tug service; supplied vessel's crew with freshwater requirements on board from January 1, 1985 up to October 31, 1985 and provided vessel with one (1) set gasoline driven 3\" diameter centrifugal water pump, and supplied gasoline, oil operator and mechanics from January 1, 1985 to September 15, 1985. That the said obligation under Obligation No. 409-102-12-412-85 was approved and concurred by the Bureau Auditor of the Commission on Audit.\n\nThus, the two obligations (Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589 in the total amount of P103,111.40 of the Bureau with the [V/L] Shipyard Corporation were for services rendered and therefore, separate and distinct valid obligations of the Bureau to the Corporation. The two obligations were pre-audited by the Bureau Auditor before payments were made by the Bureau. The payment of P103,111.40, therefore, for the berthing fees and other services rendered by [V/L] Shipyard Corporation was made in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations and therefore should not be added nor deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the vessel. Xerox copies of the Requests for Obligation of Allotment for [V/L] Shipyard Corporation in the amount of P33,457.00 and P69, 653.50, for various services rendered for RPS Malasugui in 1984 and 1985 as noted and approved by the Bureau Auditor of the Commission on Audit before payment can be made by the Bureau as Annexes 8 and 9[,] respectively. Xerox copies of the two vouchers for P33,457.00 and P69,653.60 with all supporting documents including the description of the services rendered by [V/L] Shipyard Corporation approved by Director Juanito B. Malig and Mr. Felix R. Gonzales, former Director of the Bureau, respectively, as Annexes 10 and 11. [83]\nWhen queried by the Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice, Bernaldo categorically declared that there was nothing wrong with the transaction relative to the award and sale of the vessel to the Corporation:\nPJ GARCHITORENA\nQuestions from the Court.\n\nQ Madam witness, as far as you are concerned what was wrong with the transaction or was there anything wrong with the transaction?\n\nWITNESS\nA I do not see anything wrong because the amount was more than the appraised value.\n\nQ So, as far as you are concerned the transaction was in order?\nA Yes, sir. [84]\nWhen asked whether her and petitioners' Joint Affidavit and Rejoinder Affidavit were correct even in the light of the June 18, 1986 Report, Bernaldo answered in the affirmative:\nQ Madam witness, when you executed this Joint Affidavit as well as the Rejoinder which have been marked as Exhibits 26 and 27[,] respectively[,] sometime in 1987, this superceded your previous Report, do you agree with me?\n\nPROS. TABANGUIL\nThat will call for the conclusion of the witness, your Honor.\n\nPJ GARCHITORENA\nSustained. If there is a contradiction then there is contradiction. Whether it supercedes or not is something you will have to find out, unless you will ask her why she excluded one and then the other.\n\nATTY. BLANES\n\nQ Now, when you executed Exhibit 26, Madam witness, you have taken into account your indorsement dated June 18, 1986\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And your Joint Affidavit and your Rejoinder explained correctly what actually happened with respect to the sale of M/V Malasugui?\n\nPROS. TABANGUIL\nVague, your Honor.\n\nPJ GARCHITORENA\nMay answer.\n\nWITNESS\nThey were both correct. [85]\nIt bears stressing that the Rejoinder Affidavit [86] executed by petitioners and Bernaldo were adduced in evidence by no less than the prosecution itself. Bernaldo even sought the dismissal of the criminal complaint filed by the Ombudsman against her for violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 based on the Joint Affidavit and Rejoinder Affidavit.\n\nNot to be outdone was COA auditor Marlene Nacua who declared on cross-examination that not only was the bidding process made on November 28, 1985 in order, but also that the bid of the Corporation was in accordance with COA regulations:\nATTY. PADERNAL\n\nQ At the time of the bid you know that procedure well.\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And knowing that procedure[,] you did not interpose any objection to the decision of the committee to open the bid, the lone bid of [V/L] Shipyard, is that correct.\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And am I correct to say also that as representative of the Commission on Audit during the bid although you act as a witness, you have to guide the committee as to the regulations of the Commission on Audit, is that correct, Mrs. Witness.\nA Yes, sir.\n\nQ And when the bid was opened to [V/L] Shipyard it was then your belief and perception at the time that the committee had followed all the regulations of the Commission on Audit.\nA Yes, sir. [87]\n\nx x x x\n\nQ That is why when the committee decided to open and award the bid to [V/L] Shipyard and submitted a payment of One Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Pesos (P138,900.00) you did not interpose any objection or guided the committee as to whether or not the bid was wrong or in accordance with the COA rules and regulations because you believe then that the bid and the opening of the bid was in accordance with the COA regulations, is that correct.\nA Yes, sir. [ 88]\nBy her testimony, Nacua thereby implied that the petitioners acted in good faith when the Committee conducted the bid process and made its recommendation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. The BFAR Director found no infirmity in the bid process, as shown in the minutes of the meeting on November 18, 1985 and the Committee's recommendation.\n\nMoreover, no less than BFAR Director Gonzales concurred with the Committee's recommendation and requested the Minister of Agriculture and Food for authority to award the sale of the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00 which included the P103,111.40 for services and berthing fees and P2,400.00 as publication fee. The Resident Auditor of the Ministry studied the matter very carefully and found no factual and legal basis for any objection to the recommendation. The Assistant Minister of Agriculture and Food also found the Committee's recommendation in accordance with law and COA rules and regulations, and directed the BFAR to award the vessel to the Corporation for P138,900.00. The Bureau Director complied with the directive. The ranking officials of the Ministry found no infirmity in the bid process and the Committee's recommendation, evidence of which was adduced by no less than the prosecution itself.\n\nWe agree with petitioners' contention that the recommendation of the Committee to the Ministry to approve the award of the sale was not in itself a contract of sale in favor of the Corporation. The sale of the vessel was perfected only upon notice to said Corporation that the sale of the vessel had been awarded to it.\n\nArticle 1318 of the New Civil Code provides that there is no contract unless the following requisites concur:\n\n(1) Consent of the contracting parties;\n(2) Object certain which is the subject matter of the contract;\n(3) Cause of the obligation which is established.\n\nConsent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain in such a way as to justify the other process in understanding that an assessment will conclude the agreement. An offer ripens into a contract when it is accepted. The offer must be certain and the acceptance absolute. [89]\n\nThus, a bid at an auction constitutes an offer to buy. Where, as in this case, the seller reserved the right to refuse to accept any bid made, a binding\n\nsale is not perfected until the seller accepts the bid. The seller may exercise his right to reject any bid even after the auctioneer has accepted a bid. [90] The mere determination of a public official bound to accept the offer or a proposal of a bidder does not constitute a contract. [91]\n\nAnent petitioners' contention that the Committee had no authority to dispose of the vessel to the Corporation through the sale at public auction, Section 1 of E.O. No. 888 provides that the Ministers or Heads of ministries of the government shall have the full and sole authority and responsibility to dispose of all unserviceable equipment and property:\nSection 1. Authority to Dispose - The provisions of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, the Ministers or Heads of Ministries/Agencies of the Government shall have the full and sole authority and responsibility to dispose of, all unserviceable equipment and property of their respective Ministries/Agencies . (emphasis supplied)\nIn cases of agencies attached to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food such as the BFAR, the Committee merely determines the awardee and makes a recommendation to the Minister concerned. In fine, the recommendation of the Committee is subject to such final approval:\n6. In the case of agencies attached to certain Ministries, recommendations of the Disposal Committee is subject to the final approval of the Minister concerned (emphasis supplied).\nThe awardee is not obliged to make payment for the property bid until after notice to the awardee. It is only when the awardee receives the notice of award that a contract of sale is perfected between the bidder and the seller.\n\nIn this case, the Corporation was notified of the award only after February 28, 1986. It was only upon its receipt of the notice of award that a contract of sale had been perfected between the government, as seller, and the Corporation as buyer. The Committee had no involvement in the sale of the vessel to the Corporation apart from its recommendation on the November 28, 1986 bidding, and yet, the Ombudsman indicted only petitioners, excluding the BFAR Director, Resident Auditor and Assistant Minister of Agriculture and Food.\n\nWe agree with petitioners' contention that the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 was not committed when the Committee conducted the bidding on November 28, 1985 and resolved to recommend to the Minister, through the BFAR Director, to award the sale of the vessel to the Corporation; neither was it committed when the award was made by the BFAR Director to the Corporation. This is so because there was as yet no evidence that the government sustained a loss of P53,529.60. The crime would have been committed if the Corporation had remitted to the National Treasurer the P138,900.00, and the P103,111.40 was applied by way of set-off against Bureau's account to said Corporation for Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589.\n\nThe prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the government lost P53,529.00 in the sale of the vessel. The only evidence presented is the Corporation's bid and the Report of Villa Bernaldo on June 18, 1986. The Prosecution offered no competent and sufficient evidence to prove the actual damages caused to the government. On the other hand, the BFAR Director declared that the vessel was sold to the Corporation for P138,900.00, which accepted and remitted the amount to the national treasury, as full payment of the vessel. The government receipted the amount \"as proceeds of the sale\" of the vessel. [92] To reiterate, there is no evidence on record that, after the Corporation had remitted the P138,900.00 on February 28, 1986, P103,111.40 thereof was applied to the Bureau's account under Bill Nos. 1529 and 1589 by way of set off. In fact, on January 6, 1986, before the sale of the vessel was awarded to the Corporation, the government had already remitted the P69,653.60 to it in payment of Bill No. 1589. The government did not even apply a portion of the P138,900.00 as payment of its account of P33,388.60 under Bill No. 1529, and instead paid the amount to the Corporation on May 12, 1986.\n\nThus, the full amount of the bid price, P138,900.00, which the Corporation remitted to the national treasury was intact as Bernaldo stated in her June 18, 1986 Report; yet, petitioners were prosecuted and convicted of violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019.\n\nIn fine then, the Court holds that the travesty which had been committed must be undone.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Sandiganbayan is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Petitioners Marietta T. Caugma, Amiana Abella and Rosauro Martinez are ACQUITTED of the crime charged. The bail bonds posted for petitioners' provisional liberty are CANCELLED .

MAXIMA LENSICO, RUFINA LENSICO, ROGELIO LENSICO AND VICTOR LENSICO, RESPONDENTS.DECISION\nREPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND CAVITE COLLEGE OF FISHERIES, PETITIONERS, VS. MAXIMA LENSICO, RUFINA LENSICO, ROGELIO LENSICO AND VICTOR LENSICO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nIn denying this Petition, the Court relies on a well-established doctrine. Thus, subject to some exceptions that do not apply here, the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals affirming those of the trial court cannot be disturbed, modified or reversed by this Court in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n\nThe Case\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review [1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 30, 2003 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 46045. The dispositive part of the assailed Decision disposed as follows:\n\"WHEREFORE, except for the award of attorney's fees and costs of suit which are hereby DELETED , the appealed decision is otherwise AFFIRMED .\" [3]\nThe Facts\n\nThe facts of the case are narrated by the CA as follows:\n\"x x x. This land was originally a part of the Friar Land known as Lot No. 2833, Fls-644 of the Naic Estate, containing an area of 16,459 square meters, and was registered on February 4, 1913 under Act No. 496 and issued Original Certificate of Title No. 181. Its then occupant of 34 years, the now deceased Melanio Lensico, on September 8, 1964 filed an Application to Purchase Friar Lands. An investigation was conducted by Land Investigator Dominador Bayot who found the information contained in the application to be true, and recommended that the lot be sold at private sale without auction in favor of Melanio Lensico, and gave its appraised value. After drawing three (3) favorable endorsements, said recommendation was approved. Whereupon Sales Contract No. V-270 was executed between the Bureau of Lands as the vendor and Melanio Lensico married to Donata Mojica as the vendees who paid the purchase price in full. This sale was acknowledged on August 8, 1968 by the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources with Deed No. V-1-0193. Eventually, Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-78832 was issued on September 8, 1975 in the names of Melanio Lensico and Donata Mojica.\n\n\"Out of the 16,459 square meters total area of the property, Cavite College occupies a portion of some 11,650. Their squabble began after the death of the registered owners, their children and heirs namely the litigants Maxima, Rufina, Rogelio and Victor, surnamed Lensico, required the payment of rentals for the occupancy of the area. Their demands having been ignored, the Lensicos required Cavite College compensation for occupancy and to either vacate or buy the premises. The Republic of the Philippines on the other hand made moves to cancel the issued Transfer Certificate of Title. Their disagreements resulted in the filing of Civil Case No. NC-934 and Civil Case No. NC-963.\n\n\" Civil Case No. NC-934 is a suit styled to be for Recovery of Possession of Property or Payment of Price of Land filed by the Lensicos against Cavite College. They alleged that they are the legitimate children of the registered owners; that it was only after the death of their parents when they learned that Cavite College has been occupying a portion of the lot sans payment of rentals; that apart from verbal demands they also sent three (3) letters to Cavite College but to no avail.\n\n\"Cavite College admitted the existence of TCT T-78332 but insisted that by its actual occupation since 1961 and the immense improvements it had introduced, it has a better and superior right to the property. Cavite College traced its right of possession on the following occurrences: that Congress on June 18, 1960 enacted Republic Act [2] 661 which was AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SCHOOL OF FISHERIES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF NAIC, PROVINCE OF CAVITE; that pursuant to this, the Naic Municipal Council on August 6, 1961 passed a resolution designated as KAPASIYAHANG IPINAGKAKALOOB SA CAVITE SCHOOL OF FISHERIES ANG MGA SANGAB (FORESHORE LAND) SIMULA SA NGAYON MGA BAGONG KARSADA (BOUNDARY) HANGGANG SA NAYON NG BUCANA, PARA MAGAMIT SA KANILANG PAGTUTURO. That after this, Cavite College started to construct its school buildings without objection from the Lensicos or their parents. It averred that the property in question was mostly an area reclaimed from the sea by the construction of rock groins. Although Cavite College admitted that the property was covered by a title, it argued that its issuance to the registered owners is null and void because the lot is actually a part of the foreshore land which is a public domain. The sales application of the registered owners was only on 1964 whereas Cavite College had been occupying the area since 1961. And that the Information Sheet for the sales application did not disclose the true improvements on the property because despite the buildings that Cavite College have constructed thereon and which occupies the greater area, what was reflected as improvements are only the following: \"one house of strong materials, 1 small nipa hut, 6 coconut trees, and 1 tamarind tree, valued P500.00\" Cavite College stressed that with its continued possession and introduction of valuable improvements thereon, it should be given a superior right to the property because had it not been for the rock groins it constructed, then the whole property which faces Manila Bay would have been lost to the sea.\n\n\" Civil Case No. NC-963 , on the other hand, is a suit for Annulment of Title and Reversion of Land to the State filed by the Republic of the Philippines against the Lensicos and the Register of Deeds for the Province of Cavite. Through this action, the Republic of the Philippines sought the cancellation of TCT No. T-78832 which it claims to be null and void, and that the Lensicos have no vested rights whatsoever on the property which is part of the foreshore land and could not be titled as private property. According to the Republic of the Philippines, the particulars given by Melanio Lensico in the Application to Purchase Friar Lands and the Information Sheet were false, and so also was the recommendation submitted by Land Investigator Dominador Bayot in the Information Sheet because it did not declare as one of the improvements in the property the school buildings and other developments introduced by Cavite College. That were it not for these false informations, then there would have been no sale between the Bureau of Lands and Melanio Lensico. In trying to invalidate the issuance of the TCT, it was argued by the Republic of the Philippines that the Bureau of Lands or the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had no jurisdiction or authority to award or sell the said property because this has already been designated by Republic Act 2661 on June 18, 1960 as a site for the establishment of the school of Cavite College.\n\n\"The Lensicos countered that it was not true that the Cavite College had erected a building on the property as early as 1961 because in 1964 there was as yet no building in the area. To controvert further, they stated that when Congress approved Republic Act 2661 and the Naic Municipal Council passed its Resolution on August 5, 1961 designating the foreshore land as the school site, the exact location was not yet determined and it was only later when it was discovered that the Cavite College already encroached on their property that the subject area was imputed. It was also denied that the property was part of the sea because this had long been dry land and part of the Naic Estate known as Lot No. 2833, Fls-644 and among its boundaries are Lot Nos. 733 and 2834.\n\n\"These two cases were consolidated, and on July 5, 1993, the court a quo rendered its judgment, the decretal portion of which reads:\n\"WHEREFORE, this Court passes judgment ordering the defendant in Civil Case No. NC-934 to pay plaintiffs the price of P25.00 per square meter of the portion of Lot 2833 with an area of 11,650 square meters, or, to pay reasonable rent at the rate of P2,000.00 per month from the time defendant occupied said premises until December 1999, unless the plaintiffs agreed for an extended period of 30 years thereafter. Should the defendant fail to comply to the foregoing terms and conditions, it shall vacate the said area occupied within three (3) months from finality of this Decision, and, to pay the rents thereof at the reasonable rate of P2,000.00 per month from July 1961. Since there appears no evidence regarding attorney's fees, the defendant is hereby Ordered to pay plaintiffs reasonable sum of attorney's fees of P20,000.00 plus costs of suit.'\" [4] Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that the subject lot was formerly a friar land and not a part of the public domain. The CA added that the evidence of respondents was not sufficiently overcome by that presented by petitioners to establish the claim that the property was foreshore or beach land. [5] It further said that the public nature of the land was dispelled by its registration since February 4, 1913 under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) 181. [6]\n\nThe court a quo also debunked petitioners' claim that Melanio Lensico's Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) T-78832 had been fraudulently obtained. According to the CA, the TCT was granted upon full compliance with the substantive and procedural requirements for its acquisition, such as the appraisal and investigation by the Bureau of Lands (BL), as well as several endorsements from BL officers. The appellate court further reasoned that respondents had an indefeasible and conclusive title to the property, by virtue of which the Municipal Council of Naic had no authority to dispose of any part of the land. [7]\n\nFinally, while affirming the trial court's Order for petitioners either to purchase the property or to pay corresponding rentals, the CA nonetheless set aside the award for attorney's fees for lack of basis. [8]\n\nHence, this Petition. [9]\nThe Issue\n\nPetitioners raise this sole issue for our consideration:\n\"Whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing petitioners' appeal on the ground that the subject property is not part of foreshore land and that respondents' predecessor-in-interest did not commit fraud in securing a certificate of title over the subject property.\" [10]\nOtherwise stated, the issue is whether respondents' predecessor was the lawful owner of the parcel of land occupied by petitioner school.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Petition has no merit.\n\nSole Issue:\nOwnership of the Subject Premises\n\nPetitioners argue that respondents did not have a valid title to the property, because TCT T-78832 was null and void. They contend that Lot 2833, the area covered by the title, is foreshore and beach land and, thus, a piece of public property. [11] Consequently, it may not be alienated or registered, notwithstanding the alleged possession of it by Melanio Lensico for a substantial length of time. [12] They present the Information Sheet he prepared and two Survey Plans, all describing the property as beach land. That it was mostly so was allegedly revealed, too, by the trial court's ocular inspection. [13]\n\nTo further bolster their position, petitioners allege that it was previously not in existence, because it did not appear in the June 6, 1911 map of the Naic Friar Estate, although it did in the March 25, 1930 survey, which described it as beach land. They also submit pictures taken by a geodetic engineer of the Bureau of Lands during the relocation survey, illustrating that two corners of the lot adjoined the Manila Bay. [14] Thus, they conclude that the property is foreshore land.\n\nForeshore or Friar Lands\n\nOn the basis of all these arguments, petitioners ask this Court to set aside the trial and the appellate courts' factual finding that the subject property was not foreshore land.\n\nIt must be stressed that only questions of law may be raised in petitions to review decisions of the Court of Appeals filed before this Court. [15] The factual findings of the CA affirming those of the trial court are final and conclusive. They cannot be reviewed by this Court, save only in the following circumstances, which we find absent in the instant case: (1) when the factual conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; (2) when the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case in making its findings, which are further contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the CA's findings are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the conclusions do not cite the specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) when the CA's finding's of fact, supposedly premised on the absence of evidence, is contradicted by the evidence on record. [16]\n\nPetitioners have failed to establish that the present case falls under any of the exceptions enumerated above. A perusal of the facts and evidence presented does not convince this Court to deviate from the findings of fact of the courts a quo . The lower courts properly appreciated the evidence submitted by both parties as regards the nature of the property. These courts have determined that the lot was part of the friar lands that had been titled since 1913; it was not foreshore land.\n\nForeshore land has been defined as that which lies between the high and the low water marks, and that is alternately wet and dry according to the flow of the tide. [17] In other words, it is that strip of land between high and low water, the land left dry by the flux and reflux of the tides. [18]\n\nIn the present case, although corners 3 and 4 of Lot 2833 have been shown to adjoin [19] the sea, they -- let alone the entire Lot 2833 -- have not been proven to be covered by water during high tide. Hence, the property cannot be considered foreshore land.\n\nFraud in Title Application\n\nPetitioners submit that because TCT No. T-78832 was fraudulently acquired, the principle of indefeasibility of title does not attach to it. They allege that Melanio Lensico was merely a dummy. Supposedly because he was illiterate, someone else completed the application without verifying from the former the correctness of the entries made. [20] In that application, the latter allegedly misrepresented Lensico as the actual occupant of the property at the time. Petitioners, as testified to by their witnesses as well as Rogelio Lensico, had purportedly constructed several buildings in the area before the application was filed. [21] The alleged misrepresentation is cited as a sufficient ground to nullify the TCT. [22]\n\nTo illustrate an alleged pattern of fraud, petitioners maintain that the application was granted without actual investigation, which no government employee could have conducted on Saturday and Sunday, the days between September 18, 1964, when the application was submitted; and September 21, 1964, when the Information Sheet, stating that an investigation had been conducted, was completed. They further contend that the elder Lensico's description of the lot and the improvements on it were blindly and wholly copied in the Information Sheet. [23]\n\nFinally, Melanio Lensico purportedly failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of notice (to the municipal president) and publication, as laid down in Sections 9 and 11 of Act 1120, which governs the disposition of friar lands. [24] Petitioners point out that neither the school nor the elders in the area were aware of the application.\n\nWhether fraud attended the application for the title is a factual question that revolves purely upon a proper appreciation of the evidence. For the same reasons stated previously, the findings of the lower courts that petitioners failed to adduce evidence sufficient to establish that fraud had attended the issuance of the title to Lensico cannot be overturned.\n\nTo prove the existence of fraud, petitioners rely on mere allegations unsupported by sufficient evidence. There is no showing that, although illiterate, Lensico was not informed of the contents of the document he was privy to. Neither is there any evidence to show the absence of an actual investigation of the property. Petitioners' allegation that government employees do not work on weekends, when pitted against the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed, [25] falls short of the required preponderance of evidence.\n\nPetitioners maintain that Lensico misrepresented himself as the actual occupant of the property at the time of his application to purchase the land. They insist that respondents could not have been occupying it, because Petitioner Cavite College of Fisheries had already constructed buildings on 11,650 square meters of it, supposedly since 1961.\n\nAssuming arguendo that the contention of petitioners is true, the existence of those buildings at the time does not preclude the fact that Lensico could have indeed been the actual occupant of Lot 2833 -- at least, of 4,809 square meters of it. Hence, their mere assertion that they constructed buildings on a portion of the lot does not preclude the possibility that someone else could have occupied the other portions of it, and that the latter had been in possession of the entire property prior to their entry. It is worth pointing out that the College was granted the foreshore land to be used in teaching. [26] However, it ended up occupying the property, which was not foreshore but titled land, specifically a portion of Lot 2833.\n\nAll told, we find no compelling reason to disturb the factual findings of the two lower courts. Petitioners have failed to prove that, in his application to purchase Lot 2833, Melanio Lensico willfully and knowingly made any false statement that would sufficiently cause the cancellation of the application and the forfeiture (in favor of the government) of all amounts paid on the land. The validity of TCT T-78322, as well as its issuance to respondents' predecessor, stands.\n\nThe predecessor of respondents paid the government for the purchase of the entire 16,459 square meters comprising Lot 2833. Therefore, it would be just and correct that they be compensated for Petitioner Cavite College of Fisheries' use of the portion that belongs to the Lensicos.\n\nBasis for the Purchase Price\n\nPetitioners theorize that the purchase price of the land should be based on its value at the time it was taken, considering that the occupied portion consists mainly of areas reclaimed through the efforts and resources of the government. As the College is a public entity that promotes public welfare, it avers that its interests prevail over respondents' private interests. [27]\n\nIn expropriation proceedings, the value of the land and its character at the time it was taken by the government are the criteria for determining just compensation. [28] As noted in Ansaldo v. Tantuico , [29] there are instances when, as in the present case, the expropriating agency takes over the property prior to the expropriation suit, in which situation just compensation shall be determined as of the time of taking. Commissioner of Public Highways v. Burgos [30] held that the price of the land when it was taken, not its value after the passage of time, represents the true value to be paid as just compensation. Hence, the value of the property upon its actual taking, subject of course to interest accruing from that time, should be the basis of the purchase price if Petitioner Cavite College of Fisheries opts to buy the property.\n\nIn the present case, the trial court has already determined that the just compensation for the taking of the subject portion of respondents' land is the selling price of P25 per square meter or rent of P2,000 per month. The justness of this determination, which was affirmed by the CA, is not seriously assailed by petitioners. Again, we find no compelling reason to disturb this finding, as it is factual in nature.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED , and the assailed Decision AFFIRMED.

      "title": "of the very first case he filed with the Court, UDK-12854, entitled Ramon Sollegue vs. Court of Appeals, et al. Frustrated with the adverse ruling thereon, Atty. Sorreda had previously written a letter[3] dated April 2, 2001 addressed to the Chief Justice, copy furnished all the Associate Justices of this Court, the Court of Appeals and the Office of the Solicitor General, denouncing the Court, as follows:Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the manner the Court comported itself in the aforesaid case is totally execrable and atrocious, entirely unworthy of the majesty and office of the highest tribunal of the land. It is the action not of men of reason or those who believe in the rule of law, but rather of bullies and tyrants from whom \"might is right.\" I say, shame on the High Court, for shoving down a hapless suitor's throat a ruling which, from all appearances, it could not justify.Reacting to the above, the Court, in an en banc Resolution dated August 14, 2001,[4] required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be properly disciplined \"for degrading, insulting and dishonoring the Supreme Court by using vile, offensive, intemperate and contemptuous derogatory language against it\".In response to the \"show cause\" order, Atty. Sorreda addressed two (2) more letters to the Court dated December 2, 2001[5] and June 16, 2002,[6] arguing for the propriety of his action and practically lecturing the Court on his concepts of Legal and Judicial Ethics and Constitutional Law. In its Resolutions of January 15, 2002[7] and August 27, 2002[8], the Court merely noted said two letters.Quoted from his earlier communications are the following statements of Atty. Sorreda disparaging the Court with intemperate, insulting, offensive and derogatory language, to wit:\"SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE SERIOUSLY AND TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY'S JUSTICE SYSTEM\"[9]\"WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE?xxx xxx xxxI therefore deplore and condemn in the strongest term such strong-handed actuations as the Honorable Court has displayed. They are as one might expect in a dictatorship or authoritarian regime.\"[10]Persistent in imputing to the Court and its Justices offensive and uncalled remarks, Atty. Sorreda again went on a rampage in his subject letter of February 21, 2005:xxx xxx xxxMr. Chief Justice, I do not doubt that these ten cases are among the most palpably meritorious cases that have ever been brought before the Supreme Court, or any court of justice for that matter. I cannot doubt that were it not for the Sollegue \"miscounting,\" and the other incidents that ensued from it, at least some of these ten cases would have met with entirely different endings, so obvious and patent are their merits to any reasonable and impartial mind.In short, Mr. Chief Justice, it is obvious that the High Court has taken it personally against me. To the detriment of my innocent clients. And of justice.Mr. Chief Justice, why should this be? If the Court had anything against me, I stood ready to have the ax fall on my own neck, if it came to that. As I had stated in one communication-[I]f there is one thing I agree with in the High Court's position, it is that x x x if indeed I had wronged the Court in the way it had described, and if indeed my explanations and arguments \"lack merit,\" I should indeed be disciplined; and surely no less than DISBARMENT will do. It should also be done as swiftly as possible, given the gravity of the charge and the high dignity and importance of the institution attacked. Now on January 22, 2002 and May 7, 2002, the Court has resolved to deny to the undersigned the \"full opportunity\" for self-defense that he request ... therefore he is now left without any defense, and he can only wonder why no sanction has come down until the present time.Might it be because I had continued, \"Of course, I shall also only expect that such judgment, when it does come, will be a fully-reasoned one, as thoroughly discussed perhaps as that in In re Almacen, 31 SCRA 562, for the proper guidance of all concerned\"- and the Court knows that it is not able to give such a \"fully-reasoned judgment\" as I ask? But rather than admit it has done wrong and rectify the same, it would rather \"get back\" at me by means of unfavorable rulings in the cases I elevate to it- let the innocent litigants, whose only mistake was to hire me as their counsel, and the cause of justice suffer as they may.Mr. Chief Justice, that is not only unjust; that is craven cowardice, to deal with an adversary like that. It is not something I would have expected from the supreme judges of the land.I can only view other happenings in the Honorable Court in such light. The same verifications that were previously unfaulted, suddenly became course for dismissal. What other interpretation can I give it, than that the court had run out of excuses to dismiss, since I was being careful not to repeat the same adjudged \"shortcomings\"; and was now scrounging every which way for one, just so to make sure I continue to get my \"comeuppance.\"That of the first nine cases, not one was assigned to the Third Division- only either to the Second Division, then chaired by Justice Josue N. Bellosillo, which handled the Sollegue case; or the First Division, chaired by the Chief Justice, to whom I have directly written afterwards. Could it be only a coincidence - or is it a more likely explanation that the powers-that-be in the Court wanted to be very sure I never get favorable ruling? Especially when it is considered that, following Justice Bellosillo's retirement on November 12, 2003, for the first time in the history of the nation's judiciary a vacancy in the Supreme Court was filled up way beyond the constitutionally prescribed period of 90 days- and after so much mystery and intrigue has surrounded the appointment of his successor, Justice Minita V. Chico-Nazario. In fact Justice Nazario was sworn in on July 14, 2004, just one day before a new retirement took place, this time of Justice Jose C. Vitug. It was only following this latest retirement, that for the first time this counsel had a case assigned to other than the First and Second Division. Could it be that Justice Vitug, then Chairman of the Third Division, and Justice Nazario, erstwhile presiding Justice of the Sandiganbayan, had redoubtable reputations for independent-mindedness; and the powers-that-be in the court exercised their utmost influence to at least prevent the both of them sitting in the bench at the same time, lest together they should \"buck the system\" and divide the Court, if not successfully sway the Court to favorably rule on the undersigned counsel's cases before it?xxx xxx xxxBut this time, in these ten cases I have recounted, I am wholly convinced that the court is in the wrong. I cannot but thus be filled with both acute sadness and burning indignation. Sadness as counsel, to come to the realization that the high institution of which I am an officer has sunk to such a low. Indignation as a citizen, that the public officers who are supposed to serve him and help him find justice, should instead give judgments that so insult the intelligence and glare with iniquity.Mr. Chief Justice, whatever gave the Court the notion that it could pronounce 29 days as greater than 60 days, and not to have to account for it? Who can believe that the supposedly most illustrious legal minds of the land, would miss seeing grave abuse of discretion in the actions of an agency that directly contravened numerous laws and rules all at once? How could democracy's vaunted \"last bulwark\" suffer a widow and her children to thereafter live in their toilet, by sanctioning the plainly void sale and illegal demolition of their erstwhile family home? Did the court pause for even three minutes to put itself in the shoes of an evidently innocent man kept locked up for three years now on a manifestly false and fabricated charge, before it so blandly invoked its \"discretion\" not to entertain his appeal at all? Where did the Court get such brazenness, such shameless boldness, as to dismiss on the ground that the docket fees had not been paid, when the evidence clearly show they in fact were? What manner of men are you- even challenging the citizenry to inform on the corrupt, and the bar to become like \"Frodo\" in the fight against society's evils in your public speeches and writings, and yet you yourselves committing the same evils when hidden from public view. Are all these rulings in the ten cases not the clearest manifestation that the supreme magistrates have bought into the \"What-are-we-in-power-for\" mentality? (Underscoring ours)Upon instructions of the Chief Justice, Atty. Sorreda's aforesaid letter of 21 February 2005 was included in the March 15, 2005 en banc agenda of the Court.In an en banc Resolution[11] dated March 15, 2005, the Court again required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for maliciously attacking the Court and its Justices.By way of compliance to the second \"show cause\" order, Atty Sorreda, in his letter of May 10, 2005[12], again with copies thereof furnished the Justices, judges and lawyers thereunder listed, states that he \"does not see the need to say any more\" because the \"cause\" has \"already been shown as clear as day\" in his earlier letter of 21 February 2005, adding that \"[T]he need is for the High Tribunal to act on the instant matter swiftly and decisively\". While admitting \"the great seriousness of the statements and imputations I have leveled against the Court\", he dared the Court whether \"it is capable of a judgment that will be upheld by the 'Supreme Judge'\".After going over the records of the cases in which Atty. Sorreda accuses the Court of being unfair in the resolution thereof, the Court stands by its rulings thereon. Atty. Sorreda mockingly stated that the Court does not know how to count when it dismissed the Sollegue case on ground of failure to file the petition therein within the reglementary period. For the enlightenment of the good counsel, the Court dismissed the petition in Sollegue not only for failure to have it filed within the period fixed in Sec. 4, Rule 65 but also for failure to submit the duplicate original or certified true copy of the questioned resolution of the Court of Appeals dated June 28, 1999 in accordance with Sec. 1, Rule 65 and Sec. 3, Rule 46, in relation to Sec. 2, Rule 56.[13] In another case, Ronilo Sorreda vs. CA, Atty. Sorreda claimed that said case was dismissed on the mere ground of insufficient verification. Again, Atty. Sorreda must be reminded that the petition was dismissed not merely for defective verification but more so because the petition was evidently used as a substitute for a lost remedy of appeal.[14] We see no need to belabor the grounds for the dismissal of the other cases enumerated by counsel, said grounds having been stated in the respective minute resolutions which were plain, clear, simply worded and understandable to everyone, even to those who do not have a formal education in law. Suffice it to say that the dismissal of those petitions was the result of a thorough deliberation among members of this Court.Atty. Sorreda's imputation of manipulation in the assignment and raffle of cases is utterly baseless and at best a mere figment of his imagination.Unfounded accusations or allegations or words tending to embarrass the court or to bring it into disrepute have no place in a pleading. Their employment serves no useful purpose. On the contrary, they constitute direct contempt of court or contempt in facie curiae and a violation of the lawyer's oath and a transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility.In Ang vs. Castro[15], this Court held that if a pleading containing derogatory, offensive and malicious statements is submitted in the same court or judge in which the proceedings are pending, it is direct contempt, equivalent as it is to a misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the administration of justice. Direct contempt is punishable summarily.[16]Atty Sorreda's conduct likewise violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically -CANON 11 - A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others.x x xRule 11.03 - A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the courts.Rule 11.04 - A lawyer shall not attribute to a judge motives not supported by the record or having no materiality to the case.While a lawyer owes absolute fidelity to the cause of his client, full devotion to his client's genuine interest and warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his client's rights, as well as the exertion of his utmost learning and ability,[17] he must do so only within the bounds of the law.[18] A lawyer is entitled to voice his criticism within the context of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech which must be exercised responsibly. After all, every right carries with it the corresponding obligation. Freedom is not freedom from responsibility, but freedom with responsibility. The lawyer's fidelity to his client must not be pursued at the expense of truth and orderly administration of justice. It must be done within the confines of reason and common sense.[19]Atty. Sorreda, as a citizen and as an officer of the court, is entitled to criticize the rulings of this Court, to point out where he feels the Court may have lapsed with error. But, certainly, this does not give him the unbridled license to insult and malign the Court and bring it into disrepute. Against such an assault, the Court is duty-bound \"to act to preserve its honor and dignity and to safeguard the morals and ethics of the legal profession\".[20]The eloquent words of the late Justice Conrado V. Sanchez in Rheem of the Philippines vs. Ferrer[21] are enlightening:By now, a lawyer's duties to the Court have become commonplace. Really, there could hardly be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof. Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, in categorical terms, spells out one such duty: \"To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.\" As explicit is the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that \"[i]t is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.\" That same canon, as a corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to support the courts against \"unjust criticism and clamor.\" And more. The attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a conduct that should be \"with all good fidelity xxx to the courts.\" Worth remembering is that the duty of an attorney to the courts \"can only be maintained by rendering no service involving any disrespect to the judicial office which he is bound to uphold.\"In Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel,[22] Justice Sanchez further elucidated:A lawyer is an officer of the courts; he is, \"like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.\" His duty is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts to which he owes fidelity, \"not to promote distrust in the administration of justice.\" Faith in the courts a lawyer should seek to preserve. For, to undermine the judicial edifice \"is disastrous to the continuity of government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people.\" Thus has it been said of a lawyer that \"[a]s an officer of the court, it is his sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice.\"Likewise, in Zaldivar vs. Gonzales,[23] we held:Respondent Gonzales is entitled to the constitutional guarantee of free speech. No one seeks to deny him that right, least of all this Court. What respondent seems unaware of is that freedom of speech and of expression, like all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute and that freedom of expression needs an occasion to be adjusted to and accommodated with the requirement of equally important public interests. One of these fundamental public interests is the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the administration of justice. There is no antimony between free expression and the integrity of the system of administering justice. For the protection and maintenance of freedom of expression itself can be secured only within the context of a functioning and orderly system of dispensing justice, with the context, in other words, of viable independent institutions for delivery of justice which are accepted by the general community.As officer of the court, Atty. Sorreda has the duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts and to promote confidence in the fair administration of justice.[24] No less must this be and with greater reasons in the case of the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, as the last bulwark of justice and democracyAtty. Sorreda must be reminded that his first duty is not to his client but to the administration of justice, to which his client's success is wholly subordinate. His conduct ought to and must always be scrupulously observant of law and ethics. The use of intemperate language and unkind ascription can hardly be justified nor can it have a place in the dignity of judicial forum. Civility among members of the legal profession is a treasured tradition that must at no time be lost to it.[25]Here, Atty. Sorreda has transcended the permissible bounds of fair comment and constructive criticism to the detriment of the orderly administration of justice. Free expression, after all, must not be used as a vehicle to satisfy one's irrational obsession to demean, ridicule, degrade and even destroy this Court and its magistrates.[26]We have constantly reminded that any gross misconduct of a lawyer, whether in his professional or private capacity, puts his moral character in serious doubt as a member of the Bar, and renders him unfit to continue in the practice of law.[27]In the very recent similar case of Tacardon, et al vs. Ponce Enrile,[28] we imposed on the respondent therein the penalty of suspension from the Bar. Here, as in Tacardon, we find the exclusion of Atty. Sorreda from the Bar a fitting sanction until he proves himself worthy to enjoy the privileges of membership to the profession. It is imperative to instill in him sense of discipline that should teach him anew of his duty to respect courts of justice, especially this Tribunal. This rehabilitation must be done outside the brotherhood he has dishonored and to which he will be allowed to return only after he has purged himself of his misdeeds.[29]WHEREFORE, ATTY. NOEL S. SORREDA is found guilty both of contempt of court and violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility amounting to gross misconduct as an officer of the court and member of the Bar. He is hereby indefinitely SUSPENDED as a member of the Bar and is prohibited from engaging in the practice of law until otherwise ordered by this Court.Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished the Court Administrator to be distributed to all courts for their information.

SORREDA.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nGARCIA, J.:\n\nIn a letter [1] to the Chief Justice bearing date February 21, 2005, with copies thereof furnished all the Associate Justices of the Court and other government entities, RTC judges and counsels listed thereunder, Atty. Noel S. Sorreda, who identified himself as \"member, Philippine Bar\", expressed his frustrations over the unfavorable outcome of and the manner by which the Court resolved the following cases filed by him, to wit:\nUDK-12854, Ramon Sollegue vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,\nG.R. No. 149334, Artemio Dalsen vs. Commission on Elections\nG.R. No. 148440, Lilia Sanchez vs. Court of Appeals\nG.R. No. 152766, Lilia Sanchez vs. Court of Appeals, et al.\nG.R.

Alba-Estoesta, et al.\nIn said letter, Atty. Sorreda recounted the alleged circumstances surrounding the dismissal on February 7, 2000 [2] of the very first case he filed with the Court, UDK-12854 , entitled Ramon Sollegue vs. Court of Appeals, et al. Frustrated with the adverse ruling thereon, Atty. Sorreda had previously written a letter [3] dated April 2, 2001 addressed to the Chief Justice, copy furnished all the Associate Justices of this Court, the Court of Appeals and the Office of the Solicitor General, denouncing the Court, as follows:\nMr. Chief Justice, I believe the manner the Court comported itself in the aforesaid case is totally execrable and atrocious, entirely unworthy of the majesty and office of the highest tribunal of the land.\u00a0 It is the action not of men of reason or those who believe in the rule of law, but rather of bullies and tyrants from whom \"might is right.\" I say, shame on the High Court, for shoving down a hapless suitor's throat a ruling which, from all appearances, it could not justify .\nReacting to the above, the Court, in an en banc Resolution dated August 14, 2001, [4] required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be properly disciplined \"for degrading, insulting and dishonoring the Supreme Court by using vile, offensive, intemperate and contemptuous derogatory language against it\".\n\nIn response to the \"show cause\" order, Atty. Sorreda addressed two (2) more letters to the Court dated December 2, 2001 [5] and June 16, 2002, [6] arguing for the propriety of his action and practically lecturing the Court on his concepts of Legal and Judicial Ethics and Constitutional Law.\u00a0 In its Resolutions of January 15, 2002 [7] and August 27, 2002 [8] , the Court merely noted said two letters.\n\nQuoted from his earlier communications are the following statements of Atty. Sorreda disparaging the Court with intemperate, insulting, offensive and derogatory language, to wit:\n\"SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE SERIOUSLY AND TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY'S JUSTICE SYSTEM\" [9]\n\n\"WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE?\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\nI therefore deplore and condemn in the strongest term such strong-handed actuations as the Honorable Court has displayed.\u00a0 They are as one might expect in a dictatorship or authoritarian regime.\" [10]\nPersistent in imputing to the Court and its Justices offensive and uncalled remarks, Atty. Sorreda again went on a rampage in his subject letter of February 21, 2005:\nxxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 xxx\n\nMr. Chief Justice, I do not doubt that these ten cases are among the most palpably meritorious cases that have ever been brought before the Supreme Court, or any court of justice for that matter. I cannot doubt that were it not for the Sollegue \"miscounting,\" and the other incidents that ensued from it, at least some of these ten cases would have met with entirely different endings, so obvious and patent are their merits to any reasonable and impartial mind.\n\nIn short, Mr. Chief Justice, it is obvious that the High Court has taken it personally against me.\u00a0 To the detriment of my innocent clients.\u00a0 And of justice.\n\nMr. Chief Justice, why should this be? If the Court had anything against me, I stood ready to have the ax fall on my own neck, if it came to that.\u00a0 As I had stated in one communication-\n[I]f there is one thing I agree with in the High Court's position, it is that x x x if indeed I had wronged the Court in the way it had described, and if indeed my explanations and arguments \"lack merit,\" I should indeed be disciplined; and surely no less than DISBARMENT will do. It should also be done as swiftly as possible, given the gravity of the charge and the high dignity and importance of the institution attacked. Now on January 22, 2002 and May 7, 2002, the Court has resolved to deny to the undersigned the \"full opportunity\" for self-defense that he request ... therefore he is now left without any defense, and he can only wonder why no sanction has come down until the present time.\nMight it be because I had continued, \"Of course, I shall also only expect that such judgment, when it does come, will be a fully-reasoned one, as thoroughly discussed perhaps as that in In re Almacen , 31 SCRA 562, for the proper guidance of all concerned\"- and the Court knows that it is not able to give such a \"fully-reasoned judgment\" as I ask? But rather than admit it has done wrong and rectify the same, it would rather \"get back\" at me by means of unfavorable rulings in the cases I elevate to it- let the innocent litigants, whose only mistake was to hire me as their counsel, and the cause of justice suffer as they may.\n\nMr. Chief Justice, that is not only unjust; that is craven cowardice, to deal with an adversary like that. It is not something I would have expected from the supreme judges of the land.\n\nI can only view other happenings in the Honorable Court in such light. The same verifications that were previously unfaulted, suddenly became course for dismissal. What other interpretation can I give it, than that the court had run out of excuses to dismiss, since I was being careful not to repeat the same adjudged \"shortcomings\"; and was now scrounging every which way for one, just so to make sure I continue to get my \"comeuppance.\"\n\nThat of the first nine cases, not one was assigned to the Third Division- only either to the Second Division, then chaired by Justice Josue N. Bellosillo, which handled the Sollegue case; or the First Division, chaired by the Chief Justice, to whom I have directly written afterwards.\u00a0 Could it be only a coincidence - or is it a more likely explanation that the powers-that-be in the Court wanted to be very sure I never get favorable ruling?\u00a0 Especially when it is considered that, following Justice Bellosillo's retirement on November 12, 2003, for the first time in the history of the nation's judiciary a vacancy in the Supreme Court was filled up way beyond the constitutionally prescribed period of 90 days- and after so much mystery and intrigue has surrounded the appointment of his successor, Justice Minita V. Chico-Nazario.\u00a0 In fact Justice Nazario was sworn in on July 14, 2004, just one day before a new retirement took place, this time of Justice Jose C. Vitug. It was only following this latest retirement, that for the first time this counsel had a case assigned to other than the First and Second Division. Could it be that Justice Vitug, then Chairman of the Third Division, and Justice Nazario, erstwhile presiding Justice of the Sandiganbayan, had redoubtable reputations for independent-mindedness; and the powers-that-be in the court exercised their utmost influence to at least prevent the both of them sitting in the bench at the same time, lest together they should \"buck the system\" and divide the Court, if not successfully sway the Court to favorably rule on the undersigned counsel's cases before it?\n\nxxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 xxx\n\nBut this time, in these ten cases I have recounted, I am wholly convinced that the court is in the wrong. I cannot but thus be filled with both acute sadness and burning indignation. Sadness as counsel, to come to the realization that the high institution of which I am an officer has sunk to such a low. Indignation as a citizen, that the public officers who are supposed to serve him and help him find justice, should instead give judgments that so insult the intelligence and glare with iniquity .\n\nMr. Chief Justice, whatever gave the Court the notion that it could pronounce 29 days as greater than 60 days, and not to have to account for it?\u00a0 Who can believe that the supposedly most illustrious legal minds of the land, would miss seeing grave abuse of discretion in the actions of an agency that directly contravened numerous laws and rules all at once?\u00a0 How could democracy's vaunted \"last bulwark\" suffer a widow and her children to thereafter live in their toilet, by sanctioning the plainly void sale and illegal demolition of their erstwhile family home? Did the court pause for even three minutes to put itself in the shoes of an evidently innocent man kept locked up for three years now on a manifestly false and fabricated charge, before it so blandly invoked its \"discretion\" not to entertain his appeal at all? Where did the Court get such brazenness, such shameless boldness, as to dismiss on the ground that the docket fees had not been paid, when the evidence clearly show they in fact were? What manner of men are you- even challenging the citizenry to inform on the corrupt, and the bar to become like \"Frodo\" in the fight against society's evils in your public speeches and writings, and yet you yourselves committing the same evils when hidden from public view.\u00a0 Are all these rulings in the ten cases not the clearest manifestation that the supreme magistrates have bought into the \"What-are-we-in-power-for\" mentality ? (Underscoring ours)\nUpon instructions of the Chief Justice, Atty. Sorreda's aforesaid letter of 21 February 2005 was included in the March 15, 2005 en banc agenda of the Court.\n\nIn an en banc Resolution [11] dated March 15, 2005, the Court again required Atty. Sorreda to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for maliciously attacking the Court and its Justices.\n\nBy way of compliance to the second \"show cause\" order, Atty Sorreda, in his letter of May 10, 2005 [12] , again with copies thereof furnished the Justices, judges and lawyers thereunder listed, states that he \"does not see the need to say any more\" because the \"cause\" has \"already been shown as clear as day\" in his earlier letter of 21 February 2005, adding that \"[T]he need is for the High Tribunal to act on the instant matter swiftly and decisively\".\u00a0 While admitting \"the great seriousness of the statements and imputations I have leveled against the Court\", he dared the Court whether \"it is capable of a judgment that will be upheld by the 'Supreme Judge'\".\n\nAfter going over the records of the cases in which Atty. Sorreda accuses the Court of being unfair in the resolution thereof, the Court stands by its rulings thereon.\u00a0 Atty. Sorreda mockingly stated that the Court does not know how to count when it dismissed the Sollegue case on ground of failure to file the petition therein within the reglementary period.\u00a0 For the enlightenment of the good counsel, the Court dismissed the petition in Sollegue not only for failure to have it filed within the period fixed in Sec. 4, Rule 65 but also for failure to submit the duplicate original or certified true copy of the questioned resolution of the Court of Appeals dated June 28, 1999 in accordance with Sec. 1, Rule 65 and Sec. 3, Rule 46, in relation to Sec. 2, Rule 56. [13] In another case, Ronilo Sorreda vs. CA , Atty. Sorreda claimed that said case was dismissed on the mere ground of insufficient verification.\u00a0 Again, Atty. Sorreda must be reminded that the petition was dismissed not merely for defective verification but more so because the petition was evidently used as a substitute for a lost remedy of appeal. [14] We see no need to belabor the grounds for the dismissal of the other cases enumerated by counsel, said grounds having been stated in the respective minute resolutions which were plain, clear, simply worded and understandable to everyone, even to those who do not have a formal education in law.\u00a0 Suffice it to say that the dismissal of those petitions was the result of a thorough deliberation among members of this Court.\n\nAtty. Sorreda's imputation of manipulation in the assignment and raffle of cases is utterly baseless and at best a mere figment of his imagination.\n\nUnfounded accusations or allegations or words tending to embarrass the court or to bring it into disrepute have no place in a pleading. Their employment serves no useful purpose. On the contrary, they constitute direct contempt of court or contempt in facie curiae and a violation of the lawyer's oath and a transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\n\nIn Ang vs. Castro [15] , this Court held that if a pleading containing derogatory, offensive and malicious statements is submitted in the same court or judge in which the proceedings are pending, it is direct contempt, equivalent as it is to a misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the administration of justice.\u00a0 Direct contempt is punishable summarily. [16]\n\nAtty Sorreda's conduct likewise violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically -\nCANON 11 - A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others.\n\nx x x\n\nRule 11.03 - A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the courts.\n\nRule 11.04 - A lawyer shall not attribute to a judge motives not supported by the record or having no materiality to the case.\nWhile a lawyer owes absolute fidelity to the cause of his client, full devotion to his client's genuine interest and warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his client's rights, as well as the exertion of his utmost learning and ability, [17] he must do so only within the bounds of the law. [18] A lawyer is entitled to voice his criticism within the context of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech which must be exercised responsibly.\u00a0 After all, every right carries with it the corresponding obligation. Freedom is not freedom from responsibility, but freedom with responsibility. The lawyer's fidelity to his client must not be pursued at the expense of truth and orderly administration of justice.\u00a0 It must be done within the confines of reason and common sense. [19]\n\nAtty. Sorreda, as a citizen and as an officer of the court, is entitled to criticize the rulings of this Court, to point out where he feels the Court may have lapsed with error.\u00a0 But, certainly, this does not give him the unbridled license to insult and malign the Court and bring it into disrepute.\u00a0 Against such an assault, the Court is duty-bound \"to act to preserve its honor and dignity and to safeguard the morals and ethics of the legal profession\". [20]\n\nThe eloquent words of the late Justice Conrado V. Sanchez in Rheem of the Philippines vs. Ferrer [21] are enlightening:\nBy now, a lawyer's duties to the Court have become commonplace. Really, there could hardly be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof. Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, in categorical terms, spells out one such duty: \"To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.\" As explicit is the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that \"[i]t is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.\" That same canon, as a corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to support the courts against \"unjust criticism and clamor.\" And more. The attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a conduct that should be \"with all good fidelity xxx to the courts.\" Worth remembering is that the duty of an attorney to the courts \"can only be maintained by rendering no service involving any disrespect to the judicial office which he is bound to uphold.\"\nIn Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel , [22] Justice Sanchez further elucidated:\nA lawyer is an officer of the courts; he is, \"like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.\" His duty is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts to which he owes fidelity, \" not to promote distrust in the administration of justice .\" Faith in the courts a lawyer should seek to preserve. For, to undermine the judicial edifice \"is disastrous to the continuity of government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people.\" Thus has it been said of a lawyer that \"[a]s an officer of the court, it is his sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice.\"\nLikewise, in Zaldivar vs. Gonzales , [23] we held:\nRespondent Gonzales is entitled to the constitutional guarantee of free speech.\u00a0 No one seeks to deny him that right, least of all this Court.\u00a0 What respondent seems unaware of is that freedom of speech and of expression, like all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute and that freedom of expression needs an occasion to be adjusted to and accommodated with the requirement of equally important public interests.\u00a0 One of these fundamental public interests is the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the administration of justice.\u00a0 There is no antimony between free expression and the integrity of the system of administering justice.\u00a0 For the protection and maintenance of freedom of expression itself can be secured only within the context of a functioning and orderly system of dispensing justice, with the context, in other words, of viable independent institutions for delivery of justice which are accepted by the general community.\nAs officer of the court, Atty. Sorreda has the duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts and to promote confidence in the fair administration of justice. [24] No less must this be and with greater reasons in the case of the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, as the last bulwark of justice and democracy\n\nAtty. Sorreda must be reminded that his first duty is not to his client but to the administration of justice, to which his client's success is wholly subordinate.\u00a0 His conduct ought to and must always be scrupulously observant of law and ethics.\u00a0 The use of intemperate language and unkind ascription can hardly be justified nor can it have a place in the dignity of judicial forum.\u00a0 Civility among members of the legal profession is a treasured tradition that must at no time be lost to it. [25]\n\nHere, Atty. Sorreda has transcended the permissible bounds of fair comment and constructive criticism to the detriment of the orderly administration of justice. Free expression, after all, must not be used as a vehicle to satisfy one's irrational obsession to demean, ridicule, degrade and even destroy this Court and its magistrates. [26]\n\nWe have constantly reminded that any gross misconduct of a lawyer, whether in his professional or private capacity, puts his moral character in serious doubt as a member of the Bar, and renders him unfit to continue in the practice of law. [27]\n\nIn the very recent similar case of Tacardon, et al vs. Ponce Enrile , [28] we imposed on the respondent therein the penalty of suspension from the Bar.\u00a0 Here, as in Tacardon , we find the exclusion of Atty.

OANIA, REPRESENTED BY HIS SISTER ELIZABETH REYES, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND FLORENCIA BRAVO, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nAUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to annul and set aside the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated January 31, 2001 in CA-G.R. SP No. 58952 and its Resolution [2] of October 26, 2001, \u201cinsofar as it [CA] denied bail to the petitioner during the pendency of his appeal, and to grant bail to the petitioner.\u201d [3]\n\nThe antecedent facts of the petition are as follows:\n\nIn an Information dated May 10, 1993, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-43186, herein petitioner was charged with Homicide before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City.\n\nPetitioner posted bail guaranteed by the surety bond of Oriental Assurance Corporation (Oriental), a domestic corporation then holding offices in Caloocan City, Pasig City, and Escolta, Manila.\n\nUpon arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, trial ensued.\n\nAfter trial, the RTC set the Decision for promulgation on December 7, 1999.\u00a0 The notice of promulgation was served on petitioner at the address he gave on record.\u00a0 The Notice was received on November 12, 1999 by a certain Ana Pijo, who claimed to be an aunt of petitioner.\n\nNotices of the promulgation were also sent to Oriental at its three different addresses appearing on record.\u00a0 However, the notice sent at Oriental's Caloocan address was returned unclaimed because the corporation was no longer holding office there.\u00a0 The notice sent at Oriental's Pasig City address was received on December 7, 1999, while the one sent to its office in Manila was received only on December 9, 1999, two days after the promulgation of the Decision of the RTC.\n\nOn December 7, 1999, the RTC promulgated its Decision convicting petitioner of the crime of Homicide and accordingly penalized him pursuant to the Revised Penal Code. [4]\n\nHowever, petitioner was absent during the promulgation of the decision despite notice, and his absence was unexplained.\u00a0 This prompted the RTC to issue an Order directing the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of petitioner and for the confiscation of his bail bond. [5]\n\nOn April 7, 2000, petitioner was arrested.\u00a0 Thereafter, the RTC issued a Commitment Order committing petitioner to the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa City for service of sentence.\n\nOn April 12, 2000, petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal as well as a Motion to Lift Order of Arrest and to Enjoy Temporary Liberty Pending Appeal Under the Same Bond.\n\nOn May 5, 2000, the trial court issued an Order denying petitioner's Notice of Appeal on the ground that it had been filed out of time.\u00a0 The RTC also denied petitioner's Motion to Lift Order of Arrest and to Enjoy Temporary Liberty Pending Appeal Under the Same Bond. [6]\n\nIn its Order dated May 15, 2000, the RTC denied petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration. [7]\n\nPetitioner then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the CA contending that the presiding judge of the RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 124, acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the questioned Orders.\u00a0 He claimed that he did not receive any notice of the date of promulgation of the judgment in the subject case and neither did he know of the decision nor receive a copy thereof.\u00a0 He also asserted that he only came to know of the Decision in Criminal Case No. C-43186 on April 7, 2000, the day that he was arrested.\u00a0 Based on these premises, petitioner insisted that his bail bond should not have been confiscated and that he should not have been arrested. He also argued that the period for filing his Notice of Appeal should have started only on the day that he was arrested because it was only then that he came to know of the trial court's decision in his case.\n\nOn January 31, 2001, the CA rendered a Decision with the following dispositive portion:\nWHEREFORE, upon the foregoing premises, this petition is hereby partially GRANTED. The Orders dated May 5 and 15, 2000 of the court a quo are MODIFIED. The Notice of Appeal filed by petitioner in Criminal Case No. C-43186 is given due course and the records of the case are ordered elevated to this Court. However, the motion to lift order of arrest is denied for lack of merit. No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8]\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution of October 26, 2001.\n\nHence, herein petition raising the issues of whether the petitioner was duly notified of the promulgation of the RTC Decision on December 7, 1999; whether his absence was without justifiable cause; and whether the order for his detention during his appeal is correct, valid, and proper.\n\nOn June 28, 2002, and while the present petition was pending with this Court, the CA issued its Decision in CA-G.R. CR No. 24995, entitled \u201c People of the Philippines v. Edgardo Oania y Mugot \u201d which disposed of the appeal taken by petitioner from the RTC Decision finding him guilty of Homicide in Criminal Case No. C-43186. \u00a0The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, above premises all considered, the judgment of the trial court contained in its assailed Decision, finding accused-appellant Edgardo Oania y Mugot guilty beyond reasonable doubt, of the crime charged, is hereby AFFIRMED . However, the penalty of imprisonment imposed on the accused is hereby MODIFIED . Accused-appellant, Edgardo Oania y Mugot is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of ten (10) years of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal as maximum and to suffer all the accessory penalties as provided by law. The awards of damages by the lower court against the accused in favor of the heirs of the victim, Rogelio Bravo, are hereby AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\nCourt records bear out that herein petitioner did not appeal the above-quoted CA Decision and that on July 20, 2002, the said Decision became final and executory. In fact, Entry of Judgment had been issued by the CA and the original records have been transmitted to the RTC.\u00a0 Inevitably, the issues raised in the instant petition have been rendered moot and academic.\n\nAs such, it is unnecessary to indulge in academic discussion of a case presenting a moot question, as a judgment thereon cannot have any practical legal effect, or in the nature of things, cannot be enforced. [9] The Court will refrain from expressing its opinion in a case where no practical relief may be granted in view of a supervening event. [10]\n\nWHEREFORE , the instant petition is DISMISSED for having been rendered moot and academic by the finality of the Decision in CA-G.R.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. CHARLITO TUMULAK, APPELLANT.R E S O L U T I O N NACHURA, J.: This Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the July 19, 2006 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. H.C. No. 00107 which affirmed with modification the Judgment[2] rendered by Branch 25 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City, finding appellant Charlito Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide.In an Information[3] dated March 26, 1998, Charlito Tumulak (Charlito) was charged for parricide committed as follows:That on or about February 10, 1998, at more or less 4:00 o\u2019 clock in the afternoon at Purok 3, Poblacion, Municipality of Claveria, Province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with deliberate intent and with intent to kill, then and there, willfully, unlawfully boxed and mauled and feloniously beaten (sic) and strike with the used (sic) of hard object his father Marcelino Tumulak, thereby inflicting serious physical injuries on different parts of the body of the victim which causes (sic) his instantaneous death.Charlito pleaded not guilty. Trial on the merits then ensued with the prosecution presenting: (i) Regalada Decena-Tumulak, Marcelino\u2019s wife; Dr. David Mendoza, the Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the post-mortem examination of Marcelino; and (iii) Judge Romeo Ambongan Almajar of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Jasaan, Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the preliminary investigation of the case. The prosecution\u2019s version of the incident is as follows:On a Vespera of the fiesta of the Municipality of Claveria, Misamis Oriental at about 4:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, Regalada Decena, wife of the victim, witnessed accused Charlito Tumulak mauled (sic) and beat his father Marcelino Tumulak inside their house by boxing, kicking and striking him with hard objects on different parts of his body.Marcelino Tumulak, a sexagenarian, is short in height, small in body built, and skinny. He enjoyed a temporary relief when Regalada Decena, the second wife out of martyrdom, covered the body of Marcelino Tumulak absorbing the body blows of the fist of the son Charlito Tumulak, who rested for a while. Charlie Tumulak poured kerosene on Marcelino and Regalada. He resumed the punishment of his father Marcelino by kicking him. Marcelino Tumulak collected his wits and marshaled his last ounce of strength and managed to escaped (sic) and walk towards the house of Roel Chalico and his wife Sabina.She further testified that Charlie Tumulak mauled and beat his father to death because he had a grudge on his father who burned his own chicken cage used by Charlie Tumulak.Regalada Decena, instead of following her husband to the house of her sister, Sabina Chalico, went directly to the Tanod and reported the incident.The Barangay Tanod, accompanied by Regalada Decena, went to the scene and found the lifeless and mangled body of Marcelino.Dr. David A. Mendoza, Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, conducted an external examination of the Cadaver of Marcelino Tumulak at the scene of the crime at Banban Ani-e, Claveria, Misamis, Oriental.He issued a Certificate of Death which indicated the cause of death as Internal Hemorrhage probably due to blunt trauma R/O fracturing of the 6th \u2013 7th rib.Judge Romeo Almajar, the Presiding Judge of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Jasaan Claveria, Misamis, Oriental, testified that when he asked accused Charlie Tumulak about his counter-affidavit, during the preliminary investigation accused Charlie Tumulak admitted having mauled and beat his father as shown in his resolution.[4]Only appellant testified for his defense. He denied killing his father and declared that he had a good relationship with him and his stepmother. On February 10, 1998, he was in the cockpit arena from 1:00 until 5:00 in the afternoon. Thereafter, he proceeded to Patring Tagarda\u2019s house in Purok 3, Claveria, Misamis Oriental. He never went to his father\u2019s house on that day.Not persuaded by appellant\u2019s denial and alibi, the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction, viz.:Wherefore, premises considered, this court hereby finds the accused Charlie Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide with the attendance of one generic aggravating circumstance of cruelty and sentences the accused Charlie Tumulak to death by LETHAL INJECTION and to indemnify the surviving spouse actual damages the sum of eleven thousand pesos (P11,000.00) as funeral expenses and indemnity of seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00), and seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages and to pay the cost.The accused is, likewise, credited in the service of his sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty with the full time during which [he had] undergone preventive imprisonment.SO ORDERED.[5]Initially, this case was brought to this Court for automatic review with the case docketed as G.R. No. 145448.In his Brief, appellant assigned the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:ITHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING AGAINST ACCUSED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY.IITHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON THE ACCUSED THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH.[6]The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) also filed its Brief,[7] recommending the modification of the penalty imposed upon the accused, and the damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heirs, arguing that:ITHE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY IN IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF DEATH ON APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE SAID AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT STATED IN THE INFORMATION.IITHE LOWER COURT\u2019S AWARD OF ACTUAL DAMAGES HAS NO FACTUAL BASIS: CIVIL INDEMNITY AND MORAL DAMAGES AWARDED ARE EXCESSIVE.[8]However, on September 7, 2004, the Court transferred this case to the CA consistent with its ruling in People v. Mateo.[9]On July 19, 2006, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, affirming with modification appellant\u2019s conviction. In modifying the penalty, the appellate court held that the RTC erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the imposable penalty because it had not been alleged in the Information. The CA, likewise, deleted the award of actual damages for lack of factual basis and reduced the civil indemnity and moral damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heir. The dispositive portion of the CA\u2019s Decision reads:FOR THE REASONS STATED, the appealed Judgment finding appellant Charlito Tumulak GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of parricide is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that he shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and pay the surviving spouse the sums of: P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00. The award of P11,000.00 as actual damages is deleted.SO ORDERED.[10]Appellant is now before the Court reiterating his contention. Both the OSG and the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), counsel for the accused, reiterated the arguments in their respective briefs filed during the pendency of this case upon automatic review and prior to its transfer to the CA.Despite appellant\u2019s assignment of errors, this Court, nonetheless, resolved to review not only the penalty imposed on the appellant but also his very conviction pursuant to the doctrine that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case open for review.[11] After a meticulous review of the records, this Court upholds the conviction of the appellant.We agree with the courts below that the evidence for the prosecution meets the requisite evidence beyond reasonable doubt.Regalada positively identified the appellant as the culprit. Both the trial court and the appellate court found her testimony credible. It is doctrinal that findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses deserve a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing that the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could reverse a judgment of conviction. In fact, in some instances, such findings are even accorded finality. This is so because the assignment of value to a witness\u2019 testimony is essentially the domain of the trial court, not to mention that it is the trial judge who has the direct opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness on the stand which opportunity provides him unique facility in determining whether or not to accord credence to the testimony or whether the witness is telling the truth or not.[12]Appellant's weak defense of denial and alibi cannot stand a chance against the declaration of Regalada identifying him as the killer and describing the manner in which he perpetrated the crime. We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. They are facile to fabricate and difficult to disprove, and are generally rejected.[13]Besides, for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity.[14] Apart from testifying that he never went to his father\u2019s house in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, appellant was unable to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.Furthermore, appellant failed to show that Regalada was prompted by any ill motive to falsely testify or accuse him of killing his father. Appellant himself admitted that he had a good relationship with his stepmother. The Court adheres to the established rule that, in the absence of any evidence showing reason or motive for the witness to perjure, their testimony and identification of the assailant should be given full faith and credit.[15]Between the categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses, on one hand, and the bare denial of appellants, on the other, the former must perforce prevail. An affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. They are considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable but also because they are easily fabricated and concocted.[16] Appellant's challenge of his conviction is starkly puerile.Under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 5 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, the penalty for parricide is composed of two indivisible penalties, reclusion perpetua to death. The CA was correct in disregarding the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the proper penalty because it has not been alleged in the Information. We, therefore, sustain the appellate court in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua.As to the monetary awards imposable, a modification is in order. In addition to the CA\u2019s award of P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages, temperate damages of P10,000.00 must also be awarded to the heirs of Marcelino. Regalada testified that the family incurred expenses for funeral and burial expenses, but she was not able to present receipts. It is settled that where the amount of actual damages cannot be determined because no receipts were presented to prove the same, but it is shown that the heirs are entitled thereto, temperate damages may be awarded.[17] Considering that funeral expenses were obviously incurred by the victim\u2019s heirs, an award of temperate damages is proper.WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. HC-No. 00107 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Appellant Charlito Tumulak is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide as defined in Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance in the commission of the crime, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of Marcelino Tumulak the amount of P10,000.00 as temperate damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.SO ORDERED.Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario, and Reyes, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Edgardo A.

No. 177299, November 28, 2007 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. CHARLITO TUMULAK, APPELLANT.R E S O L U T I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. CHARLITO TUMULAK, APPELLANT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nNACHURA, J.:\n\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the July 19, 2006 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. H.C. No. 00107 which affirmed with modification the Judgment [2] rendered by Branch 25 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City, finding appellant Charlito Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide.\n\nIn an Information [3] dated March 26, 1998, Charlito Tumulak (Charlito) was charged for parricide committed as follows:\nThat on or about February 10, 1998, at more or less 4:00 o\u2019 clock in the afternoon at Purok 3, Poblacion, Municipality of Claveria, Province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with deliberate intent and with intent to kill, then and there, willfully, unlawfully boxed and mauled and feloniously beaten (sic) and strike with the used (sic) of hard object his father Marcelino Tumulak, thereby inflicting serious physical injuries on different parts of the body of the victim which causes (sic) his instantaneous death. Charlito pleaded not guilty. Trial on the merits then ensued with the prosecution presenting: (i) Regalada Decena-Tumulak, Marcelino\u2019s wife; Dr. David Mendoza, the Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the post-mortem examination of Marcelino; and (iii) Judge Romeo Ambongan Almajar of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Jasaan, Claveria, Misamis Oriental, who conducted the preliminary investigation of the case. The prosecution\u2019s version of the incident is as follows:\nOn a Vespera of the fiesta of the Municipality of Claveria, Misamis Oriental at about 4:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, Regalada Decena, wife of the victim, witnessed accused Charlito Tumulak mauled (sic) and beat his father Marcelino Tumulak inside their house by boxing, kicking and striking him with hard objects on different parts of his body.\n\nMarcelino Tumulak, a sexagenarian, is short in height, small in body built, and skinny. He enjoyed a temporary relief when Regalada Decena, the second wife out of martyrdom, covered the body of Marcelino Tumulak absorbing the body blows of the fist of the son Charlito Tumulak, who rested for a while. Charlie Tumulak poured kerosene on Marcelino and Regalada. He resumed the punishment of his father Marcelino by kicking him. Marcelino Tumulak collected his wits and marshaled his last ounce of strength and managed to escaped (sic) and walk towards the house of Roel Chalico and his wife Sabina.\n\nShe further testified that Charlie Tumulak mauled and beat his father to death because he had a grudge on his father who burned his own chicken cage used by Charlie Tumulak.\n\nRegalada Decena, instead of following her husband to the house of her sister, Sabina Chalico, went directly to the Tanod and reported the incident.\n\nThe Barangay Tanod, accompanied by Regalada Decena, went to the scene and found the lifeless and mangled body of Marcelino.\n\nDr. David A. Mendoza, Municipal Health Officer of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, conducted an external examination of the Cadaver of Marcelino Tumulak at the scene of the crime at Banban Ani-e, Claveria, Misamis, Oriental.\n\nHe issued a Certificate of Death which indicated the cause of death as Internal Hemorrhage probably due to blunt trauma R/O fracturing of the 6 th \u2013 7th rib.\n\nJudge Romeo Almajar, the Presiding Judge of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Jasaan Claveria, Misamis, Oriental, testified that when he asked accused Charlie Tumulak about his counter-affidavit, during the preliminary investigation accused Charlie Tumulak admitted having mauled and beat his father as shown in his resolution. [4] Only appellant testified for his defense. He denied killing his father and declared that he had a good relationship with him and his stepmother. On February 10, 1998, he was in the cockpit arena from 1:00 until 5:00 in the afternoon. Thereafter, he proceeded to Patring Tagarda\u2019s house in Purok 3, Claveria, Misamis Oriental. He never went to his father\u2019s house on that day.\n\nNot persuaded by appellant\u2019s denial and alibi, the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction, viz.:\nWherefore, premises considered, this court hereby finds the accused Charlie Tumulak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide with the attendance of one generic aggravating circumstance of cruelty and sentences the accused Charlie Tumulak to death by LETHAL INJECTION and to indemnify the surviving spouse actual damages the sum of eleven thousand pesos (P11,000.00) as funeral expenses and indemnity of seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00), and seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages and to pay the cost.\n\nThe accused is, likewise, credited in the service of his sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty with the full time during which [he had] undergone preventive imprisonment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [5] Initially, this case was brought to this Court for automatic review with the case docketed as G.R. No. 145448.\n\nIn his Brief, appellant assigned the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:\n\nI THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING AGAINST ACCUSED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY.\n\nII\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON THE ACCUSED THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH. [6] The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) also filed its Brief, [7] recommending the modification of the penalty imposed upon the accused, and the damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heirs, arguing that:\n\nI THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF CRUELTY IN IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF DEATH ON APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE SAID AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT STATED IN THE INFORMATION.\n\nII\nTHE LOWER COURT\u2019S AWARD OF ACTUAL DAMAGES HAS NO FACTUAL BASIS: CIVIL INDEMNITY AND MORAL DAMAGES AWARDED ARE EXCESSIVE. [8] However, on September 7, 2004, the Court transferred this case to the CA consistent with its ruling in People v. Mateo . [9]\n\nOn July 19, 2006, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, affirming with modification appellant\u2019s conviction. In modifying the penalty, the appellate court held that the RTC erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the imposable penalty because it had not been alleged in the Information. The CA, likewise, deleted the award of actual damages for lack of factual basis and reduced the civil indemnity and moral damages awarded in favor of the victim\u2019s heir. The dispositive portion of the CA\u2019s Decision reads:\nFOR THE REASONS STATED , the appealed Judgment finding appellant Charlito Tumulak GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of parricide is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that he shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and pay the surviving spouse the sums of: P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00. The award of P11,000.00 as actual damages is deleted.\n\nSO ORDERED . [10] Appellant is now before the Court reiterating his contention. Both the OSG and the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), counsel for the accused, reiterated the arguments in their respective briefs filed during the pendency of this case upon automatic review and prior to its transfer to the CA.\n\nDespite appellant\u2019s assignment of errors, this Court, nonetheless, resolved to review not only the penalty imposed on the appellant but also his very conviction pursuant to the doctrine that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case open for review. [11] After a meticulous review of the records, this Court upholds the conviction of the appellant.\n\nWe agree with the courts below that the evidence for the prosecution meets the requisite evidence beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nRegalada positively identified the appellant as the culprit. Both the trial court and the appellate court found her testimony credible. It is doctrinal that findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses deserve a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing that the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could reverse a judgment of conviction. In fact, in some instances, such findings are even accorded finality. This is so because the assignment of value to a witness\u2019 testimony is essentially the domain of the trial court, not to mention that it is the trial judge who has the direct opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness on the stand which opportunity provides him unique facility in determining whether or not to accord credence to the testimony or whether the witness is telling the truth or not. [12]\n\nAppellant's weak defense of denial and alibi cannot stand a chance against the declaration of Regalada identifying him as the killer and describing the manner in which he perpetrated the crime. We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. They are facile to fabricate and difficult to disprove, and are generally rejected. [13]\n\nBesides, for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity. [14] Apart from testifying that he never went to his father\u2019s house in the afternoon of February 10, 1998, appellant was unable to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.\n\nFurthermore, appellant failed to show that Regalada was prompted by any ill motive to falsely testify or accuse him of killing his father. Appellant himself admitted that he had a good relationship with his stepmother. The Court adheres to the established rule that, in the absence of any evidence showing reason or motive for the witness to perjure, their testimony and identification of the assailant should be given full faith and credit. [15]\n\nBetween the categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses, on one hand, and the bare denial of appellants, on the other, the former must perforce prevail. An affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. They are considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable but also because they are easily fabricated and concocted. [16] Appellant's challenge of his conviction is starkly puerile.\n\nUnder Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 5 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, the penalty for parricide is composed of two indivisible penalties, reclusion perpetua to death. The CA was correct in disregarding the aggravating circumstance of cruelty in determining the proper penalty because it has not been alleged in the Information. We, therefore, sustain the appellate court in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua.\n\nAs to the monetary awards imposable, a modification is in order. In addition to the CA\u2019s award of P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages, temperate damages of P10,000.00 must also be awarded to the heirs of Marcelino. Regalada testified that the family incurred expenses for funeral and burial expenses, but she was not able to present receipts. It is settled that where the amount of actual damages cannot be determined because no receipts were presented to prove the same, but it is shown that the heirs are entitled thereto, temperate damages may be awarded. [17] Considering that funeral expenses were obviously incurred by the victim\u2019s heirs, an award of temperate damages is proper.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. HC-No. 00107 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Appellant Charlito Tumulak is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide as defined in Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance in the commission of the crime, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of Marcelino Tumulak the amount of P10,000.00 as temperate damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nYnares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario, and Reyes, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Edgardo A.

DUPAYA, CLERK IV; ROSELLER O. ISRAEL, CASHIER I; EMIL A. SIRIBAN, PROCESS SERVER; JAMES D. LORILLA, PROCESS SERVER, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nYNARES-SATIAGO, J.:\n\nFighting between court employees during office hours is a disgraceful behavior reflecting adversely on the good image of the judiciary.\u00a0 It displays a cavalier attitude towards the seriousness and dignity with which court business should be treated.\u00a0 Shouting at one another in the workplace and during office hours is arrant discourtesy and disrespect not only towards co-workers, but to the court as well. [1]\n\nOn July 26, 2001, the respondents, all court employees of Municipal Trial Court of Lal-lo, Cagayan, Branch 2, engaged in a verbal tussle which resulted in physical violence.\n\nWhen ordered [2] to explain their participation in the aforesaid incident, the respondents submitted their respective versions of the facts.\n\nRespondents Ulysses and Juliet Dupaya alleged that at around 10:00 a.m. of July 26, 2001, Juliet Dupaya and Leticia Israel had a heated argument.\u00a0 Ulysses, husband of Juliet, approached the two and told them to stop. Ulysses brought his wife to the office of the Clerk of Court followed by Leticia Israel. When the Dupaya spouses entered the office, respondent Roseller Israel, Leticia\u2019s husband, suddenly stood up from his desk and made a gesture to attack Ulysses.\u00a0 In defense, Ulysses pushed Roseller backwards.\u00a0 Respondent Emil Siriban attacked and boxed Ulysses in the face and in other parts of the body.\u00a0 Respondent James Lorilla intervened and prevented Emil from further attacking Ulysses.\n\nRoseller and Leticia alleged that at around 10:00 a.m. of July 26, 2001, while the two of them were sitting inside the Office of the Clerk of Court, the Dupaya spouses arrived and confronted Leticia. Ulysses asked Leticia in a threatening voice, \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d\u00a0 He raised his hand as if to slap the latter.\u00a0 When Roseller asked Ulysses what was wrong, the latter cursed him and hit him on the right cheek with his fist. [3] Thereafter, Ulysses turned to pick up a chair but respondent Emil Siriban told him not to harm Roseller.\u00a0 Ulysses turned towards Emil with his fist closed.\u00a0 Sensing danger, Emil swung his right hand towards Ulysses but failed to hit him.\u00a0 He threw another punch and hit the right neck of Ulysses. Roseller then pushed Ulysses towards the door of the office where the two of them grappled and fell to the ground. While Emil was trying to separate the two, Roseller was hit at the back by respondent James Lorilla.\u00a0 The other officemates of the respondents tried to pacify them but failed. It was only when the police arrived that the scuffle stopped.\n\nRespondent Emil Siriban corroborated the narration of the Israel spouses.\n\nOn August 7, 2001, Judge Briccio Aquino of the Municipal Trial Court of Lal-lo, Cagayan wrote a letter-complaint to the Office of the Court Administrator against respondents.\n\nOn August 4, 2003, the parties were required to manifest if they are willing to have the case resolved on the basis of the pleadings/records on file. On September 5, 2003, Judge Aquino manifested that, since the respondents have already patched up their differences and are now in good harmony with each other, the complaint should be dismissed and/or resolved in favor of the respondents.\u00a0 All the respondents submitted their joint manifestation stating that they have patched up their differences and that they are submitting the case with the prayer that the same be dismissed.\n\nWe find the respondents guilty of committing Misconduct in Office.\n\nTime and again, we have stressed that the conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice is circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. [4] The records reveal that the action of the respondents against each other fell short of this standard.\n\nMisconduct is a transgression of some established or definite rule of action; more particularly, it is an unlawful behavior by the public officer. [5] High-strung and belligerent behavior has no place in government service where the personnel are enjoined to act with self-restraint and civility at all times even when confronted with rudeness and insolence. [6] Such conduct is exacted from them so that they will earn and keep the public\u2019s respect for and confidence in the judicial service. [7] This standard is applied with respect to a court employee\u2019s dealings not only with the public but also with his or her co-workers in the service. Conduct violative of this standard quickly and surely corrodes respect for the courts. [8]\n\nNotwithstanding the allegation of both the complainant and the respondents that the parties have patched things up and have put the incident behind them, we will not shirk from our duty to impose the proper penalty upon the erring parties. The withdrawal or desistance of a complainant from pursuing an administrative complaint does not divest the Court of its disciplinary authority over court personnel. [9]\n\nWe take this opportunity to remind, not only the respondents, but all court personnel as well that the image of the judiciary is mirrored in the kind of conduct, official or otherwise, which the personnel within its employ display, from the judge to the lowliest clerk. Any fighting or misunderstanding becomes a disgraceful sight reflecting adversely on the good image of the judiciary. Professionalism, respect for the rights of others, good manners and right conduct are expected of all judicial officers and employees. Thus, all employees are required to preserve the judiciary\u2019s good name and standing as a true temple of justice. [10]\n\nWHEREFORE , respondents Leticia U. Israel, Roseller O. Israel, Juliet L. Dupaya, Ulysses D. Dupaya, Emil A. Siriban and James D. Lorilla are FINED One Thousand Pesos each for misconduct in office.\u00a0 All respondents are STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act(s) in the future shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J.

ANTONIO TOLEDO, LELITA TOLEDO, MAURO SUMULONG, OLIVA SUMULONG, PILAR TEVES, AS PRESIDENT AND MANAGER, RURAL BANK OF CARMEN (CEBU), INC., RESPONDENTS. DECISION YNARES-SATIAGO, J.: The property under litigation is a residential land with improvements thereon, consisting of 167 square meters, situated in Poblacion, Danao City, and covered by Tax Declaration No. 34951.[1]On December 26, 1973, petitioner Daria Gonzales Vda. de Toledo executed a Special Power of Attorney authorizing her stepson, Antonio Toledo, to obtain loan from a bank and mortgage the subject property as security therefor.[2] On January 4, 1974, Spouses Antonio and Lelita Toledo obtained a loan from Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. in the amount of P2,467.80 secured by a real estate mortgage constituted on subject property.[3]The Toledo spouses failed to pay their loan to the Bank despite several demands.[4] Hence, on July 6, 1981, the Bank extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage. Accordingly, the property was sold at public auction, with the Bank as the sole and highest bidder. Correspondingly, the Bank was issued a Certificate of Sale[5] upon satisfaction of the obligations of spouses Toledo in the amount of P5,014.00, including interests, penalty, attorney's fees and miscellaneous expenses.[6] The sale was registered with the Register of Deeds of Danao City on September 23, 1981.Spouses Toledo failed to redeem the subject property, thus the Bank caused the consolidation of ownership and the execution of the final deed of sale in its favor on November 16, 1983.[7] On August 23, 1985, the Bank sold the said parcel of land to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong.[8] However, petitioner remained on the property together with spouses Toledo.On February 18, 1986, petitioner filed a complaint against the Spouses Toledo and the Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu), Inc., and the Spouses Sumulong, for Declaration of Nullity of Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage and Sales, Reconveyance with Damages before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch XXV, docketed as Civil Case No. DNA-48.[9] She alleged that the Toledo spouses preconceived a malicious, sinister and scheming idea to induce her to execute a Special Power of Attorney to mortgage her property to the Bank and, thereafter, connived with the Sumulongs in foreclosing the mortgage. It appears that previously, or on November 18, 1985, petitioner deposited P5,200.00 with the Bank in order to redeem the subject property.[10]On June 11, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision[11] declaring the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings of the subject property a total nullity. Consequently, the Certificate of Sale, Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the Bank in favor of the Sumulong spouses were declared null and void, thus: [12] WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the Extra-Judicial Foreclosure proceedings of plaintiff's property a total nullity, consequently, the Certificate of Sale (Exh. \"7-Bank\"), Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale (Exh. \"8\"-Bank), and the Deed of Sale executed by defendant Rural Bank of Carmen in favor of defendants spouses Mauro Sumulong and Oliva Sumulong (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) are hereby declared null and void, and for which reason, the defendants spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong are hereby directed to reconvey the property subject of the foreclosure sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) in favor of the plaintiff by directing the defendant Rural Bank of Carmen to return to said defendants-spouses the amount of P5,000.00 as consideration thereof and, in turn, accepting the deposit of P5,200.00 made by plaintiff with said defendant Bank (Exh. \"A\") and returning the balance of P200.00 to the plaintiff; ordering the City Assessor of Danao City to cancel Tax Declaration No. 02391 (Exh. \"2\"-Sumulong) in the name of Spouses Oliva Sumulong and Mauro Sumulong and issue another tax declaration, in lieu thereof, in the name of plaintiff Daria G. Toledo; ordering finally, the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, to the plaintiff the sums of P20,000.00 as moral damages, P20,000.00 as exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs of the suit.The counterclaims are hereby dismissed.[13]Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a decision on July 24, 2001, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises above considered and pursuant to applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter and evidence on hand, judgment is hereby rendered granting the appeal. The assailed decision of court a quo is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered dismissing the complaint filed before the trial court by plaintiff-appellee against defendants-appellants in Civil Case No. DNA-448. No costs.[14]Hence, the instant petition for review on the following assignment of errors: THE COURT OF APPEALS APPLIED WRONGLY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3, ACT 3135 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASETHE COURT OF APPEALS WRONGLY APPLIED SECTION 5, R.A. NO. 720 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASETHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE FAILURE OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU TO COMPLY WITH SEC. 3305.1 OF THE CENTRAL BANK MANUAL OF REGULATIONS BOOK IIITHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE EXECUTED BY THE PRESIDENT/MANAGER OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS SPOUSES MAURO AND OLIVA SUMULONG WAS NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT DID NOT SHOW THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS GAVE HER AUTHORITY TO DO SO.[15]We find merit in the petition.At the outset, we noted that for failure to submit proof of service,[16] petitioner's motion for extension of thirty (30) days from August 15, 2001 within which to file the petition was denied. Thus, when petitioner filed the instant petition on September 13, 2001, it was filed out of time. This procedural lapse on the part of petitioner would have warranted the outright dismissal of the petition. However, in Sebastian and Cardenas v. Morales, et al.,[17] we held: Under Rule 1, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, liberal construction of the Rules is the controlling principle to effect substantial justice. Thus, litigations should, as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicalities. This does not mean, however that procedural rules are to be ignored or disdained at will to suit the convenience of a party. Procedural law has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely, to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism, or whimsically in the settlement of disputes. Hence, it is a mistake to suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to each other, or as often suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it would result in prejudice to the substantive rights of the litigants.x x x Hence, rules of procedure must be faithfully followed except only when for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. x x xIn the instant case, we recognize the need to relax the rules of procedure to relieve the petitioner of an injustice not commensurate with her failure to comply with the rules. For this reason, the case shall be decided on the merits.Section 3, Act 3135, as amended provides: Notice shall be given by posting notices of sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places in the municipality where the property is situated, and if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city. (Italics Supplied)Corollary thereto, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 720 as amended by Republic Act No. 5939[18] reads: The foreclosure of mortgages covering loans granted by rural banks shall be exempt from the publication in newspapers where the total amount of the loan, including interests due and unpaid, does not exceed three thousand pesos. It shall be sufficient publication in such cases if the notices of foreclosure are posted in at least three of the most conspicuous public places in the municipality and barrio where the land mortgaged is situated during the period of sixty days immediately preceding the public auction. Proof of publication as required herein shall be accomplished by affidavit of the sheriff or officer conducting the foreclosure sale and shall be attached with the records of the case: x x x. (Emphasis supplied)The foregoing provision, in exempting foreclosures by rural banks from the publication requirement when the total amount of the loan including interests due and unpaid does not exceed three thousand pesos (P3,000.00), clearly refers to the total amount of the loan along with interests and not merely the balance thereof.At the time of foreclosure in the case at bar, the total amount of petitioners' loan including interests due and unpaid with the Bank was P4,652.80.[19] Clearly, therefore, publication of notices of auction sale in newspapers of general circulation in the city or municipality where the property is situated was necessary.Undisputedly, the Bank did not publish the notices of auction sale in a newspaper of general circulation. It merely posted the notices of auction sale in three conspicuous places including where the property was located. Considering that the auction sale of the subject property to the Bank is void, no valid title passed in its favor. Consequently, the sale of the same property to spouses Sumulong is also a nullity. Nemo dat quod non habet. One cannot give what one does not have.[20]In Lucena and Parales v. Court of Appeals, Rural Bank of Naujan, et al.,[21] this Court ruled that failure to comply with statutory requirements as to publication of notice of auction sale constitutes a jurisdictional defect which invalidates the sale. Even slight deviations therefrom are not allowed.The Sumulong spouses, nevertheless, argue that assuming the Bank's title over the contested property is a nullity, they were nevertheless innocent purchasers for value who have better rights than the petitioner. One is considered an innocent purchaser who acquired the property for a valuable consideration not knowing that the title of the vendor or grantor was null and void.[22]The evidence on record shows that the Sumulong spouses are not purchasers in good faith. Well-settled is the rule that the person who asserts the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value has the burden of proving such assertion.[23] The Sumulongs failed to discharge this burden.It appears that the Sumulongs did not make any reasonable inquiry regarding the status of the land in question, despite being aware that the property was still in the possession of the petitioner and respondent spouses Toledo. Indeed, petitioner and spouses Toledo occupied the same house on the subject property. The Sumulongs did not exert any effort to communicate directly with petitioner.All that the Sumulongs did was to rely on the title of the Bank. They, however, had notice that possession of the property was with a person other than the vendor bank. It was thus incumbent upon them to look beyond the title to the subject property and make the necessary inquiries. This they neglected to do.A purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man upon his guard, and then claim that he acted in good faith under the belief that there was no defect in the title of the vendor. His mere refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor's title, will not make him an innocent purchaser for value, if it afterwards develops that the title was in fact defective, and it appears that he had such notice of the defect as would have led to its discovery had he acted with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a prudent man in a like situation.[24]In De Guzman, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,[25] we held that the failure of appellees to take the ordinary precautions which a prudent man would have taken under the circumstances, specially in buying a piece of land in the actual, visible and public possession of another person, other than the vendor, constitutes gross negligence amounting to bad faith. One who purchases real property which is in the actual possession of another should, at least make some inquiry concerning the right of those in possession. The actual possession by a person other than the vendor should, at least put the purchaser upon inquiry. He can scarcely, in the absence of such inquiry, be regarded as a bona fide purchaser as against such possessors. [26]Having arrived at the conclusion that the petitioner is still entitled to reconveyance of the subject property, we find it no longer necessary to pass upon the third and fourth issues raised by the petitioner.All told, the auction sale of the subject property is null and void for failure of Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. to comply with the statutory requirements on publication of the notices of sale. The Bank did not acquire title over the said property and it transferred no valid title to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong who were not bona fide purchasers thereof. The property not having passed to innocent purchasers for value, reconveyance is still available.[27]With respect to the damages awarded, the trial court correctly held that there is no convincing proof to support petitioner's allegation that she incurred P3,000.00 as actual damages. In determining actual damages, the court cannot rely on mere assertions, speculations, conjectures or guesswork but must depend on competent evidence and on the best evidence obtainable regarding the actual loss.[28] Likewise, the trial court soundly exercised its discretion when it awarded moral damages in the amount of P20,000.00, based on the circumstances of the case at bar.[29] However, there is no factual basis for the award of exemplary damages. Petitioner failed to establish that the Bank colluded with the Toledo spouses and the Sumulong spouses in depriving her of the parcel of land in question.WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The July 24, 2001 Decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The July 11, 1993 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Danao City, Branch 25 in Civil Case No. DNA-48, which found the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings of the subject property a total nullity and declared the Certificate of Sale, Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. in favor of spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong null and void, is REINSTATED with the MODIFICATION that the award of exemplary damages in favor of the petitioner is DELETED for lack of factual basis.SO ORDERED.Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Panganiban, Carpio, and Azcuna, JJ., concur.

[1]\n\nOn December 26, 1973, petitioner Daria Gonzales Vda . de Toledo executed a Special Power of Attorney authorizing her stepson, Antonio Toledo, to obtain loan from a bank and mortgage the subject property as security therefor. [2] On January 4, 1974, Spouses Antonio and Lelita Toledo obtained a loan from Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. in the amount of P2,467.80 secured by a real estate mortgage constituted on subject property. [3]\n\nThe Toledo spouses failed to pay their loan to the Bank despite several demands. [4] Hence, on July 6, 1981, the Bank extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage. Accordingly, the property was sold at public auction, with the Bank as the sole and highest bidder. Correspondingly, the Bank was issued a Certificate of Sale [5] upon satisfaction of the obligations of spouses Toledo in the amount of P5,014.00, including interests, penalty, attorney's fees and miscellaneous expenses. [6] The sale was registered with the Register of Deeds of Danao City on September 23, 1981.\n\nSpouses Toledo failed to redeem the subject property, thus the Bank caused the consolidation of ownership and the execution of the final deed of sale in its favor on November 16, 1983. [7] On August 23, 1985, the Bank sold the said parcel of land to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong. [8] However, petitioner remained on the property together with spouses Toledo.\n\nOn February 18, 1986, petitioner filed a complaint against the Spouses Toledo and the Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu), Inc., and the Spouses Sumulong, for Declaration of Nullity of Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage and Sales, Reconveyance with Damages before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch XXV, docketed as Civil Case No. DNA-48. [9] She alleged that the Toledo spouses preconceived a malicious, sinister and scheming idea to induce her to execute a Special Power of Attorney to mortgage her property to the Bank and, thereafter, connived with the Sumulongs in foreclosing the mortgage. It appears that previously, or on November 18, 1985, petitioner deposited P5,200.00 with the Bank in order to redeem the subject property. [10]\n\nOn June 11, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision [11] declaring the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings of the subject property a total nullity. Consequently, the Certificate of Sale, Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the Bank in favor of the Sumulong spouses were declared null and void, thus: [12]\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the Extra-Judicial Foreclosure proceedings of plaintiff's property a total nullity, consequently, the Certificate of Sale (Exh. \"7-Bank\"), Consolidation of Ownership and Final Deed of Sale (Exh. \"8\"-Bank), and the Deed of Sale executed by defendant Rural Bank of Carmen in favor of defendants spouses Mauro Sumulong and Oliva Sumulong (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) are hereby declared null and void, and for which reason, the defendants spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong are hereby directed to reconvey the property subject of the foreclosure sale and the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh. \"9\"-Bank) in favor of the plaintiff by directing the defendant Rural Bank of Carmen to return to said defendants-spouses the amount of P5,000.00 as consideration thereof and, in turn, accepting the deposit of P5,200.00 made by plaintiff with said defendant Bank (Exh. \"A\") and returning the balance of P200.00 to the plaintiff; ordering the City Assessor of Danao City to cancel Tax Declaration No. 02391 (Exh. \"2\"-Sumulong) in the name of Spouses Oliva Sumulong and Mauro Sumulong and issue another tax declaration, in lieu thereof, in the name of plaintiff Daria G. Toledo; ordering finally, the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, to the plaintiff the sums of P20,000.00 as moral damages, P20,000.00 as exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs of the suit.\n\nThe counterclaims are hereby dismissed. [13] Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a decision on July 24, 2001, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises above considered and pursuant to applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter and evidence on hand, judgment is hereby rendered granting the appeal. The assailed decision of court a quo is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered dismissing the complaint filed before the trial court by plaintiff-appellee against defendants-appellants in Civil Case No. DNA-448.\u00a0 No costs. [14] Hence, the instant petition for review on the following assignment of errors:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS APPLIED WRONGLY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3, ACT 3135 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASE\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS WRONGLY APPLIED SECTION 5, R.A. NO.\u00a0 720 AS AMENDED TO THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE CASE\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE FAILURE OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU TO COMPLY WITH SEC. 3305.1 OF THE CENTRAL BANK MANUAL OF REGULATIONS BOOK III\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE EXECUTED BY THE PRESIDENT/MANAGER OF RESPONDENT RURAL BANK OF CARMEN, CEBU IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS SPOUSES MAURO AND OLIVA SUMULONG WAS NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT DID NOT SHOW THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS GAVE HER AUTHORITY TO DO SO. [15] We find merit in the petition.\n\nAt the outset, we noted that for failure to submit proof of service, [16] petitioner's motion for extension of thirty (30) days from August 15, 2001 within which to file the petition was denied.\u00a0 Thus, when petitioner filed the instant petition on September 13, 2001, it was filed out of time. This procedural lapse on the part of petitioner would have warranted the outright dismissal of the petition.\u00a0 However, in Sebastian and Cardenas v.

(Italics Supplied)\nCorollary thereto, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 720 as amended by Republic Act No. 5939 [18] reads:\nThe foreclosure of mortgages covering loans granted by rural banks shall be exempt from the publication in newspapers where the total amount of the loan, including interests due and unpaid, does not exceed three thousand pesos . It shall be sufficient publication in such cases if the notices of foreclosure are posted in at least three of the most conspicuous public places in the municipality and barrio where the land mortgaged is situated during the period of sixty days immediately preceding the public auction. Proof of publication as required herein shall be accomplished by affidavit of the sheriff or officer conducting the foreclosure sale and shall be attached with the records of the case: x x x. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe foregoing provision, in exempting foreclosures by rural banks from the publication requirement when the total amount of the loan including interests due and unpaid does not exceed three thousand pesos (P3,000.00), clearly refers to the total amount of the loan along with interests and not merely the balance thereof.\n\nAt the time of foreclosure in the case at bar, the total amount of petitioners' loan including interests due and unpaid with the Bank was P4,652.80. [19] Clearly, therefore, publication of notices of auction sale in newspapers of general circulation in the city or municipality where the property is situated was necessary.\n\nUndisputedly, the Bank did not publish the notices of auction sale in a newspaper of general circulation. It merely posted the notices of auction sale in three conspicuous places including where the property was located. Considering that the auction sale of the subject property to the Bank is void, no valid title passed in its favor. Consequently, the sale of the same property to spouses Sumulong is also a nullity. Nemo dat quod non habet . One cannot give what one does not have. [20]\n\nIn Lucena and Parales v. Court of Appeals, Rural Bank of Naujan, et al. , [21] this Court ruled that failure to comply with statutory requirements as to publication of notice of auction sale constitutes a jurisdictional defect which invalidates the sale. Even slight deviations therefrom are not allowed.\n\nThe Sumulong spouses, nevertheless, argue that assuming the Bank's title over the contested property is a nullity, they were nevertheless innocent purchasers for value who have better rights than the petitioner. One is considered an innocent purchaser who acquired the property for a valuable consideration not knowing that the title of the vendor or grantor was null and void. [22]\n\nThe evidence on record shows that the Sumulong spouses are not purchasers in good faith. Well-settled is the rule that the person who asserts the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value has the burden of proving such assertion. [23] The Sumulongs failed to discharge this burden.\n\nIt appears that the Sumulongs did not make any reasonable inquiry regarding the status of the land in question, despite being aware that the property was still in the possession of the petitioner and respondent spouses Toledo.\u00a0 Indeed, petitioner and spouses Toledo occupied the same house on the subject property. The Sumulongs did not exert any effort to communicate directly with petitioner.\n\nAll that the Sumulongs did was to rely on the title of the Bank.\u00a0 They, however, had notice that possession of the property was with a person other than the vendor bank. It was thus incumbent upon them to look beyond the title to the subject property and make the necessary inquiries. This they neglected to do.\n\nA purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man upon his guard, and then claim that he acted in good faith under the belief that there was no defect in the title of the vendor.\u00a0 His mere refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor's title, will not make him an innocent purchaser for value, if it afterwards develops that the title was in fact defective, and it appears that he had such notice of the defect as would have led to its discovery had he acted with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a prudent man in a like situation. [24]\n\nIn De Guzman, Jr. v. Court of Appeals , [25] we held that the failure of appellees to take the ordinary precautions which a prudent man would have taken under the circumstances, specially in buying a piece of land in the actual, visible and public possession of another person, other than the vendor, constitutes gross negligence amounting to bad faith. One who purchases real property which is in the actual possession of another should, at least make some inquiry concerning the right of those in possession.\u00a0 The actual possession by a person other than the vendor should, at least put the purchaser upon inquiry.\u00a0 He can scarcely, in the absence of such inquiry, be regarded as a bona fide purchaser as against such possessors. [26]\n\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the petitioner is still entitled to reconveyance of the subject property, we find it no longer necessary to pass upon the third and fourth issues raised by the petitioner.\n\nAll told, the auction sale of the subject property is null and void for failure of Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu) Inc. to comply with the statutory requirements on publication of the notices of sale. The Bank did not acquire title over the said property and it transferred no valid title to Spouses Mauro and Oliva Sumulong who were not bona fide purchasers thereof. The property not having passed to innocent purchasers for value, reconveyance is still available. [27]\n\nWith respect to the damages awarded, the trial court correctly held that there is no convincing proof to support petitioner's allegation that she incurred P3,000.00 as actual damages. In determining actual damages, the court cannot rely on mere assertions, speculations, conjectures or guesswork but must depend on competent evidence and on the best evidence obtainable regarding the actual loss.

      "title": "BELEN A. SALVACION, PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) AND LEO H. MANLAPAS, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CHICO-NAZARIO, J.: In this Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Belen A. Salvacion (Salvacion) urges us to annul and set aside the 23 February 2006[2] and 4 August 2006[3] Resolutions[4] of the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, reversing its 11 November 2005 Resolution[5] which affirmed (a) the 7 February 2005 Resolution[6] and 12 May 2005 Order,[7] both of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, finding reasonable ground to charge respondent Leo H. Manlapas (Manlapas), then Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended; and (b) the Information thereafter filed before respondent Sandiganbayan, docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111. Consequently, petitioner Salvacion also seeks in the present Petition the reinstatement of Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division.The antecedents are not complicated.In preparation for her impending retirement on 31 December 2002, petitioner Salvacion, Bookkeeper of the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, prepared all the pertinent documents and clearance for her permanent separation from government service. One such document was an application[8] for the payment of her retirement benefits and terminal leave pay filed on 10 December 2002. Said application was duly acted upon and approved by respondent Manlapas as the Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, and the authorized official to act upon it.On 18 March 2003, petitioner Salvacion submitted to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, for payment, a Disbursement Voucher[9] duly signed and approved for payment by respondent Manlapas, and accompanied by supporting documents, in the amount of P162,291.46 representing her Terminal Leave Pay for 815.226 unused leave credits.In the intervening time, according to petitioner Salvacion, she made numerous follow-ups for the disbursement of her Terminal Leave Pay; to no avail.On 10 September 2003, a few days short of six months from the day she submitted the afore-mentioned Disbursement Voucher and its supporting documents to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, petitioner Salvacion sent, via registered mail, a letter requesting \"the release of fund for payment of my terminal leave pay x x x I will be going to Manila for medical check-up, so that I'm in dire need of money.\"[10] No response was made by respondent Manlapas.On 17 February 2004, petitioner Salvacion filed a sworn Complaint[11] before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, Masbate, charging respondent Manlapas with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f), of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, which state that:SEC. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared unlawful:x x x x(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.(f) Neglecting or refusing, after due demand or request, without sufficient justification to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending before him for the purpose of obtaining directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage, or for purpose of favoring his own interest or giving undue advantage in favor of or discriminating against any other interested party.The Complaint was docketed as I.S. No. 04-17546 (DF).In his Counter-Affidavit,[12] respondent Manlapas denied the charges against him. He averred that \"complainant had been following up the payment of her terminal leave pay as alleged x x x, however, I did not make any promise `to release the payment after a weeks (sic) time,' the truth of the matter being that I really refused immediately (not negligently) to order payment of her Terminal Leave Pay with legal, factual and sufficient justification because upon inquiry from the OIC Municipal Treasurer and contrary to the Certification issued by the previous OIC Municipal Treasurer, Mr. Ismael C. Adoptante in cohort with the complainant, Mrs. Belen A. Salvacion she `is not free from money and/or property responsibilities,' x x x.\"On 19 April 2004, the 4th Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Masbate, Richard R. Riveral, resolved[13] to dismiss the Complaint. The fiscal chose to believe the account of respondent Manlapas that his failure to release petitioner Salvacion's retirement benefits was due to the latter's supposed failure to remit the amount of P7,564.38 to the Municipal Government of Baleno.Aggrieved, petitioner Salvacion filed a Petition for Review before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, where it was docketed as Case No. OMB-L-C-04-1034-K.In a Review Resolution[14] dated 7 February 2005, issued after due proceedings, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon recommended the reversal of the finding of the Provincial Prosecutor, and thereby declared that there was probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable for the violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019. The pertinent portion of said Resolution reads:Records of this case show that complainant had retired from government service on December 31, 2002 and was subsequently issued all the pertinent documents and clearances appurtenant to her claim for payment of her terminal leave amounting to P162,291.46, with the corresponding certification from the OIC Municipal Treasurer, Esmael C. Adoptante that sufficient funds exist to cover for the payment of the same. Ironically and without valid reason, respondent denied payment of the same alleging among others, that complainant had failed to remit some of her collections amounting to P7,564.38 as contained in a new certification issued by the new acting Municipal Treasurer, MR. CEFERINO D. CORTES, JR. on February 23, 2004, a year and two months after complainant's severance from service. The averment by the respondent that he immediately ordered the non-payment of the terminal leave pay of the complainant despite her repeated demands based on an alleged cash shortage as certified to by the new OIC Municipal Treasurer only on February 23, 2004 is a flimsy excuse to cover up for his baseless and malicious act. After all, it was only on February 23, 2004 that an alleged shortage was found out. Hence, it was only on even date that he would have had a valid ground to refuse payment of the same. As the Local Chief Executive, herein respondent should have pursued the legal means to collect the alleged cash shortage allegedly owed by the complainant from the municipality. He could have substantiated his claim by filing a case against the complainant and not place the complainant in a stalemate position as regards the payment of the terminal leave pay of which she is entitled to receive, to her damage and prejudice. The more than a year's delay in the payment of what one had lawfully earned and is rightfully due seem to be a punishment and not a reward for more than two (2) decades of government service, as in this case. Respondent himself admitted that follow-ups on her claim were made by the complainant.Respondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the aforequoted Review Resolution. He argued that his refusal to release petitioner Salvacion's Terminal Leave Pay was essentially prompted by good faith, i.e., to protect the interest of the people of Baleno, Masbate, from being defrauded by petitioner Salvacion. He narrated that on the 7th and 8th of January 2003, petitioner Salvacion usurped the functions of revenue collectors by collecting tax payments from tax payers at Baleno, Masbate, amounting to P7,564.38, and issuing the corresponding Official Receipts, but failing to remit the same to the Office of the Municipal Treasurer. In support of his defense, respondent Manlapas submitted, as newly discovered evidence, photocopies of several Official Receipts dated 7 and 8 January 2003. Further, respondent Manlapas pointed out that the certification issued by the officer-in-charge (OIC) Municipal Treasurer Ismael C. Adoptante (Adoptante) that petitioner Salvacion had no more accountabilities with the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, was invalid, considering that the same was issued at the time when Adoptante had already been relieved of his duties as OIC Municipal Treasurer by virtue of Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated 2 December 2002.Despite the aforementioned arguments, in an Order[15] dated 12 May 2005, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon resolved respondent Manlapas' prayer for reconsideration in the negative. The dispositive portion of said order reads:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby recommended that the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondent be denied for lack of merit. Accordingly, the Review Resolution dated 07 February 2005 which recommended that an Information for violation of Sec. 3(f) of RA 3019 be filed against the latter stands.In affirming the Review Resolution, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon reasoned that:It could not have possibly escaped respondent's attention that complainant has sought the payment of her terminal leave pay considering that he signed the corresponding disbursement voucher certifying that the same is necessary and lawful and even approved its payment amounting to P162,291.46 x x x. Having presented said document for his signature, it should have prompted him to verify first if there is no impediment in the payment of such claim of complainant. And it appears that indeed there was none, otherwise he could not have signed the same. But now, he is now justifying his refusal of not giving complainant her terminal leave pay because the amount of P7,564.38 of her collection is missing. To this, we are not convinced because, aside from the fact that the same is uncorroborated, the purported acts of complainant of usurping the functions of the revenue collectors and misappropriating the amount of P7,564.38 transpired immediately on the month after complainant has retired. If the same is factual, immediate action thereon could have been taken and that it should have been relayed at once to complainant and not after a year. With respect to the supposed newly discovered evidence submitted by respondent, we find that the photocopied receipts issued by the municipality only confirms the fact that certain amounts were collected but not to the fact that it was complainant who collected the same and not remit it to the coffers of the municipality. Finally, with respect to the alleged invalidity of the certification made by Adoptante, it was as early as December 2002 that respondent was apprised of the latter's relief as OIC Municipal Treasurer. As such, he should have called complainant's attention of such fact right away and not raised it at this point in time had he be (sic) sincere in acting on the claim of complainant.On 29 April 2005, bearing the approval of Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio, Special Prosecutor, Office of the Ombudsman, an Information[16] was filed with the Sandiganbayan, and raffled to its Fifth Division, charging respondent Manlapas with having violated Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, with the accusatory portion of the same reading as follows:That on December 31, 2002, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, LEO H. MANLAPAS, a high ranking public officer, being then the Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, while in the performance of his official administrative functions and acting in relation thereto, with grave abuse of authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally fails and refuses without sufficient justification, to order and cause within a reasonable period of time, the payment of the terminal leave pay benefits in the amount of ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE PESOS AND FORTY SIX CENTAVOS (P162,291.46) of BELEN A. SALVACION, a retired municipal employee, after several follow-ups and due demand, the last of which was in September 2003 and requests and thereby discriminating against said BELEN A. SALVACION, to the prejudice of the latter.The Information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division. A Hold Departure Order was issued by the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, directing the Bureau of Immigration to hold the departure of respondent Manlapas and include him in the Bureau's Hold Departure List.[17] Likewise, an Order of Arrest was issued by the same division commanding the arrest of respondent Manlapas.[18]Respondent Manlapas subsequently filed the sufficient bail bond[19] for his provisional liberty which was duly approved by the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), City of Masbate, on 1 June 2005.[20]The arraignment of the accused, respondent Manlapas, was set on 29 July 2005. Before said date, however, respondent Manlapas filed an Omnibus Motion [(1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and (2) To Defer/Suspend Arraignment] on the ground that \"new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced during the preliminary investigation and which, if produced and submitted during the preliminary investigation, would have certainly established the lack of probable cause and, therefore, would have changed the conclusions and findings of the investigating prosecutors.\"[21] He claimed that he was recently informed that as early as 1 September 2003, petitioner Salvacion had already withdrawn her terminal leave application and its supporting documents. In view of said development, petitioner Salvacion's terminal leave pay was not included in the budget appropriation for Calendar Year 2003-2004. He explained that \"[h]aving withdrawn her application for terminal leave benefits as early as 01 September 2003, or MORE THAN five (5) months BEFORE the filing of the complaint-affidavit, complainant had no right to demand for the approval of her terminal leave application from herein accused. In other words, complainant had no cause of action against herein accused at the time of the filing of her complaint for the simple reason that it would have been PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE for herein accused to approve or even act upon a NON-EXISTENT application for terminal leave benefits.\"[22] He then concluded that \"[t]hus, complainant Belen A. Salvacion could not have suffered damage or injury by reason of the non-payment of her terminal leave benefits; and herein accused could not have committed a crime for not approving the payment of said benefits in the absence of any application therefor.\"[23]Petitioner Salvacion opposed the omnibus motion, denying the imputation that she withdrew her Terminal Leave Application. She declared that it was only on 27 January 2004 that she took home her disbursement voucher, after she went to see respondent Manlapas at his office to again plead for the release of her Terminal Leave Pay, and after being told by the Municipal Mayor then that \"since [petitioner Salvacion's] family could not support [respondent Manlapas] in the forthcoming May, 2004 election, [petitioner Salvacion's] request (for payment) could not be granted.\"[24] Further, petitioner Salvacion claimed that the \"accused Leo H. Manlapas further told private complainant that she should just keep her documents and wait for a new mayor to be elected because her Terminal Leave will definitely not be (sic) paid by him.\"[25] Hence, she had no choice but to bring home her voucher \"for fear that it might get lost in the Office of the Mayor.\"[26]The Sandiganbayan subsequently promulgated a Resolution on 11 November 2005 denying for lack of merit respondent Manlapas' Omnibus Motion. The graft court found correct the position of the prosecution that respondent Manlapas was basically asking the Sandiganbayan \"to assess the evidence presented by the parties, and on the basis thereof, make a conclusion as to whether or not there is probable cause to indict the accused for the offense charged x x x. However, as pointed out by the Supreme Court x x x this is not a function which the Court must be called upon to perform as this function pertains exclusively to the public prosecutor. Moreover, the prosecutor's finding of probable cause is entitled to highest respect.\"[27] The fallo of said Resolution provides:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant `Omnibus Motion 1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and 2) to Defer/Suspend Arraignment' is hereby denied for lack of merit. Arraignment of the accused will proceed as previously scheduled on November 11, 2005.[28]Respondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the foregoing Resolution maintaining that \"[s]ince the [petitioner Salvacion] had no right to apply for terminal leave benefits, the accused was under no obligation to process or approve her application.\"[29]On 23 February 2006, the Sandiganbayan reversed itself, thereby dismissing the case against respondent Manlapas. The graft court ruled that:WHEREFORE, finding no probable cause to sustain the present indictment, the present Motion for Reconsideration filed by the accused LEO H. MANLAPAS is hereby granted. The Resolution of this Court promulgated on November 11, 2005 is hereby set aside and the instant case against him is hereby ordered dismissed.The cash bond posted by the accused to obtain his provisional liberty is hereby ordered returned to him subject to the usual auditing and accounting procedures. The Hold Departure Order issued by this Court against the person of the accused on May 10, 2005 is hereby cancelled.[30]The finding that there was no probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for the violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was based on the ratiocination that:In the present case, the prosecution committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that there is probable cause against the accused. There is no sufficient evidence adduced before the Office of the Ombudsman that a violation of Section 3(f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was committed by the accused x x x.x x x xAdmittedly, the elements of the offense are that:a) The offender is a public officer;b) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him;c) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; andd) Such failure to so act is `for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party, or discriminating against another' x x x.x x x xThe second element is absent. There is sufficient justification for the accused in refusing to release the monetary benefits in favor of the private complainant after due demand by the latter. It has been established and even the reviewing prosecutors has (sic) recognized that when Ismael C. Adoptante issued the Certification on December 31, 2002, certifying that Ms. Salvacion is free from money and/or property responsibility, he was no longer authorized to do so. The accused knew this fact at the time of the alleged commission of the crime x x x. In BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002, Atty. Veronica Bombase King, Regional Director of the Bureau of Local Government Finance, immediately designated Ceferino D. Cortes as OIC Municipal Treasurer of Baleno, Masbate, before Mr. Adoptante issued his certification on December 31, 2002, that the private complainant had then no money accountability. Therefore, knowing the lack of authority of Mr. Adoptante to issue the said clearance in favor of private complainant Belen A. Salvacion, accused mayor was justified in refusing to pay the terminal leave pay benefits of Ms. Salvacion.[31]Thus, the Sandiganbayan concluded that:The absence of an essential element of the crime being imputed against the accused cannot sustain a finding of guilt of the accused. Hence, this Court has no option but to desist from inflicting upon the accused mayor the trauma of going through a trial and to dismiss the instant case.[32]Petitioner Salvacion and the People of the Philippines, through the Public Prosecutor, separately moved for the reconsideration of the latest ruling of the Sandiganbayan, but both motions were denied by the said court in a Resolution dated 4 August 2006 which was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006.On 14 March 2006, or within the reglementary period of 15 days within which to file a motion for reconsideration, Petitioner Salvacion filed the same but it was denied in another Resolution dated 3 August 2006 and received by her on 22 August 2006.Hence, this Petition for Certiorari of petitioner Salvacion filed under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court and anchored on the following arguments:I.PUBLIC RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS IN (SIC) JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT ISMAEL ADOPTANTE IS NOT AUTHORIZED AS MUNICIPAL TREASURER AT THE TIME THE MONEY/PROPERTY CLEARANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS SIGNED BY MERELY BASING ON BLGF REGIONAL SPECIAL PERSONNEL ORDER NO. 1-2002 DATED DECEMBER 2, 2002;II.SAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT GROSSLY LOST SIGHT OF THE CONTINUING REFUSAL OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COMPLAINANT OF (SIC) HER TERMINAL LEAVE BENEFITS WHICH AMOUNTED TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION; ANDIII.SAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT HAD UNJUSTIFIABLY AND UNDULY INTERFERED WITH THE FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE MADE BY THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON.[33]Petitioner Salvacion maintains that \"[t]he reliance of Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) on BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order [N]o. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002 to justify the act of the accused constitute therefore as grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction.\"[34] Moreover, she insists that \"the demand to pay the said terminal benefits is a continuing one,\"[35] such that \"from the time the approved disbursement voucher was submitted (to the) respondent Mayor to the time the written demand was given to respondent Mayor and until thereafter, respondent Mayor is, in effect, continuously refusing, without justifiable reason, to release the money claims of petitioner x x x\"[36]; and this fact, according to petitioner Salvacion, \"had escaped the attention of the Honorable Sandiganbayan.\"[37] In conclusion, petition Salvacion declares that \"the Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) had unjustifiably and unduly interfered with the findings of probable cause made by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.\"[38]Without cause to go into the merits of the case at bar, we hereby dismiss this petition.As a consequence of filing this special civil action for certiorari in place of an ordinary appeal under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Salvacion went against the fundamental precepts of procedural law.The Revised Rules of Court specifically provides that an appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Sandiganbayan is by verified petition for review on certiorari and shall raise only questions of law. Specifically, Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dictates that:SECTION 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court. - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.Note that what is being assailed in this original action are the Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 reversing the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, and ordering the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 28111. There is no question that these Resolutions already constitute a final disposition of Criminal Case No. 28111, for after ordering the dismissal of said case, there is nothing more for the graft court to do therein. These Resolutions, therefore, are fit to be subjects of an appeal to this Court via a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45.However, the present Petition is one for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court. Under Rule 65, a party may only avail himself of the special remedy of certiorari under the following circumstances:SECTION 1. Petition for Certiorari. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.The writ of certiorari issues for the correction of errors of jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It cannot be legally used for any other purpose. Its function is only to keep the inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It may issue only when the following requirements are alleged in the petition and established: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Excess of jurisdiction as distinguished from absence of jurisdiction, means that an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, a board or an officer is not authorized, and is invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of the general power in respect of it are wanting. \"Without jurisdiction\" means lack or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority.[39]Contrasting the two remedies, a petition for review is a mode of appeal, while a special civil action for certiorari is an extraordinary process for the correction of errors of jurisdiction. It is basic remedial law that the two remedies are distinct, mutually exclusive, and antithetical. The extraordinary remedy of certiorari is proper if the tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions acted without or in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law. A petition for review, on the other hand, seeks to correct errors of judgment committed by the court, tribunal, or officer. When a court, tribunal, or officer has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the dispute, the decision on all other questions arising from the case is an exercise of that jurisdiction. Consequently, all errors committed in the exercise of said jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment. Under prevailing procedural rules and jurisprudence, errors of judgment are not proper subjects of a special civil action for certiorari. For if every error committed by the trial court or quasi-judicial agency were to be the proper subject of review by certiorari, then trial would never end and the dockets of appellate courts would be clogged beyond measure.[40]Although petitioner Salvacion made general allegations in her Petition for Certiorari that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, a closer scrutiny of her arguments would reveal that she is actually challenging the Resolutions dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 based on purported errors of judgment, and not jurisdiction. It is irrefragable that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties in Criminal Case No. 28111. Petitioner Salvacion utterly failed to convince this Court that the graft court abused its discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions - grave enough to have ousted it of jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 28111 for which she may avail herself of the special remedy of certiorari.It is equally elementary in remedial law that the use of an erroneous mode of appeal is cause for dismissal of the petition for certiorari. A writ of certiorari will not issue where the remedy of appeal is available to an aggrieved party. By its nature, a petition for certiorari lies only where there is \"no appeal,\" and \"no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\"[41] A remedy is considered \"plain, speedy and adequate\" if it will promptly relieve the petitioners from the injurious effects of the judgment and the acts of the lower court or agency.[42] In this case, appeal was not only available but also a speedy and adequate remedy.[43] The availability to petitioner Salvacion of the remedy of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 from the resolutions of the Sandiganbayan effectively foreclosed her right to resort to a petition for certiorari.And while it is true that in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of substantial justice,[44] we have, before,[45] treated a petition for certiorari as a petition for review on certiorari, but only when the former was filed within the reglementary period for filing the latter. Regrettably, this exception is not applicable to the present factual milieu. The present Petition for Certiorari was filed well beyond the reglementary period for filing a petition for review, and without any reason being offered therefor.Pursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:SEC. 2. Time for filing; extension. - The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. x x x.A party litigant wishing to file a petition for review on certiorari must do so within 15 days from receipt of the judgment, final order or resolution sought to be appealed. In this case, the resolution of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006, denying the motions for reconsideration of both petitioner Salvacion and the People, was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006.[46] The instant Petition was filed only on 17 October 2006; thus, at the time of the filing of this Petition, 56 days had already elapsed, way beyond the 15-day period within which to file a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Procedure; and even beyond an extended period of 30 days, the maximum period to be granted by this Court had one been actually sought by petitioner Salvacion. As the facts stand, petitioner Salvacion has already lost the right to appeal via Rule 45.Concomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to at least explain its failure to comply with the rules.[47] Herein, petitioner Salvacion's recourse to this Court is bereft of any explanation, meritorious or otherwise, as to why she failed to properly observe the rules of procedure.Allowing appeals, although filed late in some rare cases, may not be applied to petitioner Salvacion for this rule is, again, qualified by the requirement that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the relaxation of the rules.[48] We cannot find any such exceptional circumstances in this case and neither has petitioner Salvacion endeavored to allude to the existence of any. This being so, another fundamental rule of procedure applies, and that is the doctrine that perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, so that failure to do so renders the questioned decision final and executory and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment, more so, to entertain the appeal.[49]WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED.

SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) AND LEO H. MANLAPAS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nIn this Petition for Certiorari [1] under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Belen A. Salvacion (Salvacion) urges us to annul and set aside the 23 February 2006 [2] and 4 August 2006 [3] Resolutions [4] of the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, reversing its 11 November 2005 Resolution [5] which affirmed (a) the 7 February 2005 Resolution [6] and 12 May 2005 Order, [7] both of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, finding reasonable ground to charge respondent Leo H. Manlapas (Manlapas), then Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended; and (b) the Information thereafter filed before respondent Sandiganbayan, docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111. Consequently, petitioner Salvacion also seeks in the present Petition the reinstatement of Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division.\n\nThe antecedents are not complicated.\n\nIn preparation for her impending retirement on 31 December 2002, petitioner Salvacion, Bookkeeper of the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, prepared all the pertinent documents and clearance for her permanent separation from government service. One such document was an application [8] for the payment of her retirement benefits and terminal leave pay filed on 10 December 2002. Said application was duly acted upon and approved by respondent Manlapas as the Municipal Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, and the authorized official to act upon it.\n\nOn 18 March 2003, petitioner Salvacion submitted to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, for payment, a Disbursement Voucher [9] duly signed and approved for payment by respondent Manlapas, and accompanied by supporting documents, in the amount of P162,291.46 representing her Terminal Leave Pay for 815.226 unused leave credits.\n\nIn the intervening time, according to petitioner Salvacion, she made numerous follow-ups for the disbursement of her Terminal Leave Pay; to no avail.\n\nOn 10 September 2003, a few days short of six months from the day she submitted the afore-mentioned Disbursement Voucher and its supporting documents to the Office of the Municipal Mayor, petitioner Salvacion sent, via registered mail, a letter requesting \"the release of fund for payment of my terminal leave pay x x x I will be going to Manila for medical check-up, so that I'm in dire need of money.\" [10] No response was made by respondent Manlapas.\n\nOn 17 February 2004, petitioner Salvacion filed a sworn Complaint [11] before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, Masbate, charging respondent Manlapas with violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f), of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, which state that:\nSEC. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared unlawful:\n\nx x x x\n\n(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.\n\n(f) Neglecting or refusing, after due demand or request, without sufficient justification to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending before him for the purpose of obtaining directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage, or for purpose of favoring his own interest or giving undue advantage in favor of or discriminating against any other interested party.\nThe Complaint was docketed as I.S. No. 04-17546 (DF).\n\nIn his Counter-Affidavit, [12] respondent Manlapas denied the charges against him. He averred that \"complainant had been following up the payment of her terminal leave pay as alleged x x x, however, I did not make any promise `to release the payment after a weeks (sic) time,' the truth of the matter being that I really refused immediately (not negligently) to order payment of her Terminal Leave Pay with legal, factual and sufficient justification because upon inquiry from the OIC Municipal Treasurer and contrary to the Certification issued by the previous OIC Municipal Treasurer, Mr. Ismael C. Adoptante in cohort with the complainant, Mrs. Belen A. Salvacion she `is not free from money and/or property responsibilities,' x x x.\"\n\nOn 19 April 2004, the 4 th Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Masbate, Richard R. Riveral, resolved [13] to dismiss the Complaint. The fiscal chose to believe the account of respondent Manlapas that his failure to release petitioner Salvacion's retirement benefits was due to the latter's supposed failure to remit the amount of P7,564.38 to the Municipal Government of Baleno.\n\nAggrieved, petitioner Salvacion filed a Petition for Review before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, where it was docketed as Case No. OMB-L-C-04-1034-K.\n\nIn a Review Resolution [14] dated 7 February 2005, issued after due proceedings, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon recommended the reversal of the finding of the Provincial Prosecutor, and thereby declared that there was probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable for the violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019. The pertinent portion of said Resolution reads:\nRecords of this case show that complainant had retired from government service on December 31, 2002 and was subsequently issued all the pertinent documents and clearances appurtenant to her claim for payment of her terminal leave amounting to P162,291.46, with the corresponding certification from the OIC Municipal Treasurer, Esmael C. Adoptante that sufficient funds exist to cover for the payment of the same. Ironically and without valid reason, respondent denied payment of the same alleging among others, that complainant had failed to remit some of her collections amounting to P7,564.38 as contained in a new certification issued by the new acting Municipal Treasurer, MR. CEFERINO D. CORTES, JR. on February 23, 2004, a year and two months after complainant's severance from service. The averment by the respondent that he immediately ordered the non-payment of the terminal leave pay of the complainant despite her repeated demands based on an alleged cash shortage as certified to by the new OIC Municipal Treasurer only on February 23, 2004 is a flimsy excuse to cover up for his baseless and malicious act. After all, it was only on February 23, 2004 that an alleged shortage was found out. Hence, it was only on even date that he would have had a valid ground to refuse payment of the same. As the Local Chief Executive, herein respondent should have pursued the legal means to collect the alleged cash shortage allegedly owed by the complainant from the municipality. He could have substantiated his claim by filing a case against the complainant and not place the complainant in a stalemate position as regards the payment of the terminal leave pay of which she is entitled to receive, to her damage and prejudice. The more than a year's delay in the payment of what one had lawfully earned and is rightfully due seem to be a punishment and not a reward for more than two (2) decades of government service, as in this case. Respondent himself admitted that follow-ups on her claim were made by the complainant.\nRespondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the aforequoted Review Resolution . He argued that his refusal to release petitioner Salvacion's Terminal Leave Pay was essentially prompted by good faith, i.e. , to protect the interest of the people of Baleno, Masbate, from being defrauded by petitioner Salvacion. He narrated that on the 7 th and 8 th of January 2003, petitioner Salvacion usurped the functions of revenue collectors by collecting tax payments from tax payers at Baleno, Masbate, amounting to P7,564.38, and issuing the corresponding Official Receipts, but failing to remit the same to the Office of the Municipal Treasurer. In support of his defense, respondent Manlapas submitted, as newly discovered evidence, photocopies of several Official Receipts dated 7 and 8 January 2003. Further, respondent Manlapas pointed out that the certification issued by the officer-in-charge (OIC) Municipal Treasurer Ismael C. Adoptante (Adoptante) that petitioner Salvacion had no more accountabilities with the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, was invalid, considering that the same was issued at the time when Adoptante had already been relieved of his duties as OIC Municipal Treasurer by virtue of Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated 2 December 2002.\n\nDespite the aforementioned arguments, in an Order [15] dated 12 May 2005, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon resolved respondent Manlapas' prayer for reconsideration in the negative. The dispositive portion of said order reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby recommended that the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondent be denied for lack of merit. Accordingly, the Review Resolution dated 07 February 2005 which recommended that an Information for violation of Sec. 3(f) of RA 3019 be filed against the latter stands.\nIn affirming the Review Resolution , the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon reasoned that:\nIt could not have possibly escaped respondent's attention that complainant has sought the payment of her terminal leave pay considering that he signed the corresponding disbursement voucher certifying that the same is necessary and lawful and even approved its payment amounting to P162,291.46 x x x. Having presented said document for his signature, it should have prompted him to verify first if there is no impediment in the payment of such claim of complainant. And it appears that indeed there was none, otherwise he could not have signed the same. But now, he is now justifying his refusal of not giving complainant her terminal leave pay because the amount of P7,564.38 of her collection is missing. To this, we are not convinced because, aside from the fact that the same is uncorroborated, the purported acts of complainant of usurping the functions of the revenue collectors and misappropriating the amount of P7,564.38 transpired immediately on the month after complainant has retired. If the same is factual, immediate action thereon could have been taken and that it should have been relayed at once to complainant and not after a year. With respect to the supposed newly discovered evidence submitted by respondent, we find that the photocopied receipts issued by the municipality only confirms the fact that certain amounts were collected but not to the fact that it was complainant who collected the same and not remit it to the coffers of the municipality. Finally, with respect to the alleged invalidity of the certification made by Adoptante, it was as early as December 2002 that respondent was apprised of the latter's relief as OIC Municipal Treasurer. As such, he should have called complainant's attention of such fact right away and not raised it at this point in time had he be (sic) sincere in acting on the claim of complainant.\nOn 29 April 2005, bearing the approval of Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio, Special Prosecutor, Office of the Ombudsman, an Information [16] was filed with the Sandiganbayan, and raffled to its Fifth Division, charging respondent Manlapas with having violated Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, with the accusatory portion of the same reading as follows:\nThat on December 31, 2002, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Baleno, Masbate, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, LEO H. MANLAPAS, a high ranking public officer, being then the Mayor of Baleno, Masbate, while in the performance of his official administrative functions and acting in relation thereto, with grave abuse of authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally fails and refuses without sufficient justification, to order and cause within a reasonable period of time, the payment of the terminal leave pay benefits in the amount of ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE PESOS AND FORTY SIX CENTAVOS (P162,291.46) of BELEN A. SALVACION, a retired municipal employee, after several follow-ups and due demand, the last of which was in September 2003 and requests and thereby discriminating against said BELEN A. SALVACION, to the prejudice of the latter.\nThe Information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 28111 before the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division. A Hold Departure Order was issued by the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, directing the Bureau of Immigration to hold the departure of respondent Manlapas and include him in the Bureau's Hold Departure List. [17] Likewise, an Order of Arrest was issued by the same division commanding the arrest of respondent Manlapas. [18]\n\nRespondent Manlapas subsequently filed the sufficient bail bond [19] for his provisional liberty which was duly approved by the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), City of Masbate, on 1 June 2005. [20]\n\nThe arraignment of the accused, respondent Manlapas, was set on 29 July 2005. Before said date, however, respondent Manlapas filed an Omnibus Motion [(1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and (2) To Defer/Suspend Arraignment] on the ground that \"new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced during the preliminary investigation and which, if produced and submitted during the preliminary investigation, would have certainly established the lack of probable cause and, therefore, would have changed the conclusions and findings of the investigating prosecutors.\" [21] He claimed that he was recently informed that as early as 1 September 2003, petitioner Salvacion had already withdrawn her terminal leave application and its supporting documents. In view of said development, petitioner Salvacion's terminal leave pay was not included in the budget appropriation for Calendar Year 2003-2004. He explained that \"[h]aving withdrawn her application for terminal leave benefits as early as 01 September 2003, or MORE THAN five (5) months BEFORE the filing of the complaint-affidavit, complainant had no right to demand for the approval of her terminal leave application from herein accused. In other words, complainant had no cause of action against herein accused at the time of the filing of her complaint for the simple reason that it would have been PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE for herein accused to approve or even act upon a NON-EXISTENT application for terminal leave benefits.\" [22] He then concluded that \"[t]hus, complainant Belen A. Salvacion could not have suffered damage or injury by reason of the non-payment of her terminal leave benefits; and herein accused could not have committed a crime for not approving the payment of said benefits in the absence of any application therefor.\" [23]\n\nPetitioner Salvacion opposed the omnibus motion, denying the imputation that she withdrew her Terminal Leave Application. She declared that it was only on 27 January 2004 that she took home her disbursement voucher, after she went to see respondent Manlapas at his office to again plead for the release of her Terminal Leave Pay, and after being told by the Municipal Mayor then that \"since [petitioner Salvacion's] family could not support [respondent Manlapas] in the forthcoming May, 2004 election, [petitioner Salvacion's] request (for payment) could not be granted.\" [24] Further, petitioner Salvacion claimed that the \"accused Leo H. Manlapas further told private complainant that she should just keep her documents and wait for a new mayor to be elected because her Terminal Leave will definitely not be (sic) paid by him.\" [25] Hence, she had no choice but to bring home her voucher \"for fear that it might get lost in the Office of the Mayor.\" [26]\n\nThe Sandiganbayan subsequently promulgated a Resolution on 11 November 2005 denying for lack of merit respondent Manlapas' Omnibus Motion. The graft court found correct the position of the prosecution that respondent Manlapas was basically asking the Sandiganbayan \"to assess the evidence presented by the parties, and on the basis thereof, make a conclusion as to whether or not there is probable cause to indict the accused for the offense charged x x x. However, as pointed out by the Supreme Court x x x this is not a function which the Court must be called upon to perform as this function pertains exclusively to the public prosecutor. Moreover, the prosecutor's finding of probable cause is entitled to highest respect.\" [27] The fallo of said Resolution provides:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant `Omnibus Motion 1) For Determination and/or Review of Finding of Probable Cause and/or Reinvestigation; and 2) to Defer/Suspend Arraignment' is hereby denied for lack of merit. Arraignment of the accused will proceed as previously scheduled on November 11, 2005. [28]\nRespondent Manlapas moved for the reconsideration of the foregoing Resolution maintaining that \"[s]ince the [petitioner Salvacion] had no right to apply for terminal leave benefits, the accused was under no obligation to process or approve her application.\" [29]\n\nOn 23 February 2006, the Sandiganbayan reversed itself, thereby dismissing the case against respondent Manlapas. The graft court ruled that:\nWHEREFORE, finding no probable cause to sustain the present indictment, the present Motion for Reconsideration filed by the accused LEO H. MANLAPAS is hereby granted. The Resolution of this Court promulgated on November 11, 2005 is hereby set aside and the instant case against him is hereby ordered dismissed.\n\nThe cash bond posted by the accused to obtain his provisional liberty is hereby ordered returned to him subject to the usual auditing and accounting procedures. The Hold Departure Order issued by this Court against the person of the accused on May 10, 2005 is hereby cancelled. [30]\nThe finding that there was no probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for the violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was based on the ratiocination that:\nIn the present case, the prosecution committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that there is probable cause against the accused. There is no sufficient evidence adduced before the Office of the Ombudsman that a violation of Section 3(f) of Republic Act No. 3019 was committed by the accused x x x.\nx x x x\n\nAdmittedly, the elements of the offense are that:\n\na) The offender is a public officer;\n\nb) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him;\n\nc) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; and\n\nd) Such failure to so act is `for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party, or discriminating against another' x x x.\n\nx x x x\nThe second element is absent. There is sufficient justification for the accused in refusing to release the monetary benefits in favor of the private complainant after due demand by the latter. It has been established and even the reviewing prosecutors has (sic) recognized that when Ismael C. Adoptante issued the Certification on December 31, 2002, certifying that Ms. Salvacion is free from money and/or property responsibility, he was no longer authorized to do so. The accused knew this fact at the time of the alleged commission of the crime x x x. In BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order No. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002, Atty. Veronica Bombase King, Regional Director of the Bureau of Local Government Finance, immediately designated Ceferino D. Cortes as OIC Municipal Treasurer of Baleno, Masbate, before Mr. Adoptante issued his certification on December 31, 2002, that the private complainant had then no money accountability. Therefore, knowing the lack of authority of Mr. Adoptante to issue the said clearance in favor of private complainant Belen A. Salvacion, accused mayor was justified in refusing to pay the terminal leave pay benefits of Ms. Salvacion. [31]\nThus, the Sandiganbayan concluded that:\nThe absence of an essential element of the crime being imputed against the accused cannot sustain a finding of guilt of the accused. Hence, this Court has no option but to desist from inflicting upon the accused mayor the trauma of going through a trial and to dismiss the instant case. [32]\nPetitioner Salvacion and the People of the Philippines, through the Public Prosecutor, separately moved for the reconsideration of the latest ruling of the Sandiganbayan, but both motions were denied by the said court in a Resolution dated 4 August 2006 which was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006.\n\nOn 14 March 2006, or within the reglementary period of 15 days within which to file a motion for reconsideration, Petitioner Salvacion filed the same but it was denied in another Resolution dated 3 August 2006 and received by her on 22 August 2006.\n\nHence, this Petition for Certiorari of petitioner Salvacion filed under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court and anchored on the following arguments:\nI.\n\nPUBLIC RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS IN (SIC) JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT ISMAEL ADOPTANTE IS NOT AUTHORIZED AS MUNICIPAL TREASURER AT THE TIME THE MONEY/PROPERTY CLEARANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS SIGNED BY MERELY BASING ON BLGF REGIONAL SPECIAL PERSONNEL ORDER NO. 1-2002 DATED DECEMBER 2, 2002;\n\nII.\n\nSAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT GROSSLY LOST SIGHT OF THE CONTINUING REFUSAL OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COMPLAINANT OF (SIC) HER TERMINAL LEAVE BENEFITS WHICH AMOUNTED TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION; AND\n\nIII.\n\nSAME PUBLIC RESPONDENT HAD UNJUSTIFIABLY AND UNDULY INTERFERED WITH THE FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE MADE BY THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON. [33]\nPetitioner Salvacion maintains that \"[t]he reliance of Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) on BLGF Regional Special Personnel Order [N]o. 1-2002 dated December 2, 2002 to justify the act of the accused constitute therefore as grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction.\" [34] Moreover, she insists that \"the demand to pay the said terminal benefits is a continuing one,\" [35] such that \"from the time the approved disbursement voucher was submitted (to the) respondent Mayor to the time the written demand was given to respondent Mayor and until thereafter, respondent Mayor is, in effect, continuously refusing, without justifiable reason, to release the money claims of petitioner x x x\" [36] ; and this fact, according to petitioner Salvacion, \"had escaped the attention of the Honorable Sandiganbayan.\" [37] In conclusion, petition Salvacion declares that \"the Honorable Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) had unjustifiably and unduly interfered with the findings of probable cause made by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.\" [38]\n\nWithout cause to go into the merits of the case at bar, we hereby dismiss this petition.\n\nAs a consequence of filing this special civil action for certiorari in place of an ordinary appeal under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, petitioner Salvacion went against the fundamental precepts of procedural law.\n\nThe Revised Rules of Court specifically provides that an appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Sandiganbayan is by verified petition for review on certiorari and shall raise only questions of law. Specifically, Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dictates that:\nSECTION 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court . - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari . The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.\nNote that what is being assailed in this original action are the Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 reversing the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to hold respondent Manlapas liable to stand trial for violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, and ordering the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 28111. There is no question that these Resolutions already constitute a final disposition of Criminal Case No. 28111, for after ordering the dismissal of said case, there is nothing more for the graft court to do therein. These Resolutions, therefore, are fit to be subjects of an appeal to this Court via a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 .\n\nHowever, the present Petition is one for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court. Under Rule 65, a party may only avail himself of the special remedy of certiorari under the following circumstances:\nSECTION 1. Petition for Certiorari. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.\nThe writ of certiorari issues for the correction of errors of jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It cannot be legally used for any other purpose. Its function is only to keep the inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It may issue only when the following requirements are alleged in the petition and established: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Excess of jurisdiction as distinguished from absence of jurisdiction, means that an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, a board or an officer is not authorized, and is invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of the general power in respect of it are wanting. \"Without jurisdiction\" means lack or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority. [39]\n\nContrasting the two remedies, a petition for review is a mode of appeal, while a special civil action for certiorari is an extraordinary process for the correction of errors of jurisdiction. It is basic remedial law that the two remedies are distinct, mutually exclusive, and antithetical. The extraordinary remedy of certiorari is proper if the tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions acted without or in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law. A petition for review, on the other hand, seeks to correct errors of judgment committed by the court, tribunal, or officer. When a court, tribunal, or officer has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the dispute, the decision on all other questions arising from the case is an exercise of that jurisdiction. Consequently, all errors committed in the exercise of said jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment. Under prevailing procedural rules and jurisprudence, errors of judgment are not proper subjects of a special civil action for certiorari . For if every error committed by the trial court or quasi-judicial agency were to be the proper subject of review by certiorari , then trial would never end and the dockets of appellate courts would be clogged beyond measure. [40]\n\nAlthough petitioner Salvacion made general allegations in her Petition for Certiorari that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, a closer scrutiny of her arguments would reveal that she is actually challenging the Resolutions dated 23 February 2006 and 4 August 2006 based on purported errors of judgment, and not jurisdiction. It is irrefragable that the Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties in Criminal Case No. 28111. Petitioner Salvacion utterly failed to convince this Court that the graft court abused its discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions - grave enough to have ousted it of jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 28111 for which she may avail herself of the special remedy of certiorari .\n\nIt is equally elementary in remedial law that the use of an erroneous mode of appeal is cause for dismissal of the petition for certiorari . A writ of certiorari will not issue where the remedy of appeal is available to an aggrieved party. By its nature, a petition for certiorari lies only where there is \"no appeal,\" and \"no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\" [41] A remedy is considered \"plain, speedy and adequate\" if it will promptly relieve the petitioners from the injurious effects of the judgment and the acts of the lower court or agency. [42] In this case, appeal was not only available but also a speedy and adequate remedy. [43] The availability to petitioner Salvacion of the remedy of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 from the resolutions of the Sandiganbayan effectively foreclosed her right to resort to a petition for certiorari .\n\nAnd while it is true that in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of substantial justice, [44] we have, before, [45] treated a petition for certiorari as a petition for review on certiorari , but only when the former was filed within the reglementary period for filing the latter. Regrettably, this exception is not applicable to the present factual milieu. The present Petition for Certiorari was filed well beyond the reglementary period for filing a petition for review, and without any reason being offered therefor.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:\nSEC. 2. Time for filing; extension. - The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. x x x.\nA party litigant wishing to file a petition for review on certiorari must do so within 15 days from receipt of the judgment, final order or resolution sought to be appealed. In this case, the resolution of the Sandiganbayan dated 23 February 2006, denying the motions for reconsideration of both petitioner Salvacion and the People, was received by petitioner Salvacion on 22 August 2006 . [46] The instant Petition was filed only on 17 October 2006 ; thus, at the time of the filing of this Petition, 56 days had already elapsed, way beyond the 15-day period within which to file a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Procedure; and even beyond an extended period of 30 days, the maximum period to be granted by this Court had one been actually sought by petitioner Salvacion. As the facts stand, petitioner Salvacion has already lost the right to appeal via Rule 45.\n\nConcomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to at least explain its failure to comply with the rules. [47] Herein, petitioner Salvacion's recourse to this Court is bereft of any explanation, meritorious or otherwise, as to why she failed to properly observe the rules of procedure.\n\nAllowing appeals, although filed late in some rare cases, may not be applied to petitioner Salvacion for this rule is, again, qualified by the requirement that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the relaxation of the rules. [48] We cannot find any such exceptional circumstances in this case and neither has petitioner Salvacion endeavored to allude to the existence of any. This being so, another fundamental rule of procedure applies, and that is the doctrine that perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, so that failure to do so renders the questioned decision final and executory and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment, more so, to entertain the appeal. [49]\n\nWHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED .

No. 6943, March 13, 2009 ]\n\nATTY. GODOFREDO C. MANIPUD, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FELICIANO M. BAUTISTA,D E C I S I O N\nATTY. GODOFREDO C. MANIPUD, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FELICIANO M. BAUTISTA,\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\n\nOn November 21, 2005, Atty. Godofredo C. Manipud filed a complaint for disbarment against Atty. Feliciano M. Bautista for alleged commission of forum shopping in violation of his attorney's oath and in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and for improper conduct.\n\nComplainant narrated that he was a mortgagee of the property allegedly owned by Jovita de Macasieb.\u00a0 When the mortgagor failed to pay despite demands, he filed an application for extra-judicial foreclosure of the said property with the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court in Dagupan City.\u00a0 Thereafter, a Notice of Extrajudicial Sale was issued and the public auction was scheduled on April 1, 2005.\n\nHowever, on March 22, 2005, Atty. Bautista, as counsel for the mortgagor, filed with the Regional Trial Court a verified complaint for \" Annulment of Real Estate Mortgage and Notice of Extrajudicial Sale with Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order with Damages \" which was docketed as Civil Case No. 2005-0107-D. The case was raffled to Branch 41 which issued a TRO.\u00a0 On May 18, 2005, the trial court issued an order denying the prayer for issuance of preliminary injunction.\n\nThus, upon application of complainant-mortgagee, the sheriff caused another Notice of Extrajudicial Sale.\u00a0 The public auction was scheduled on July 29, 2005.\u00a0 However, on July 20, 2005, Atty. Bautista filed another case for annulment of real estate mortgage which was docketed as Civil Case No. 2005-0253-D.\n\nAccording to complainant, the two complaints for annulment of real estate mortgage filed by respondent contained the same allegations, involved the same parties, the same subject matter, the same facts, the same issues and sought the same relief.\u00a0 Complainant argued that the act of respondent of filing the two complaints constitutes a clear case of forum shopping, an improper conduct which tends to degrade the administration of justice, and a violation of Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which commands all lawyers to uphold at all times the dignity and integrity of the legal profession.\n\nComplainant also alleged that when his counsel filed a Motion to Dismiss the second complaint on the ground of forum shopping, respondent promptly filed a Motion to Withdraw Complaint.\n\nIn his Comment, Atty. Bautista alleged that the filing of the second complaint for annulment of the extrajudicial sale was a desperate attempt on his part to restrain the sale of his client's property; that he is not guilty of forum shopping because he did not act willfully, maliciously and with ill-intent; that he disclosed in the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping of the second complaint the pendency of the first complaint, as well as in paragraphs 18, 20 and 22 of the said second complaint; that he filed the second complaint out of pity for his client who was about to lose her family home due to the unconscionably high monthly interest being charged by complainant; and that his prompt filing of a motion to withdraw the second complaint was indicative of his good faith.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, the case was referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.\u00a0 The IBP then directed the parties to attend a mandatory conference during which the admissions, stipulation of facts and definition of issues, shall be taken up. After the mandatory conference, the parties were heard and thereafter directed to submit their respective position papers.\n\nIn his Position Paper, complainant alleged that herein respondent, Atty. Bautista, is a nephew of Jovita de Macasieb, the registered owner of the mortgaged property.\u00a0 Although the loans which were obtained in 2003 appeared to have been received by Jovita de Macasieb, complainant learned, particularly on October 3, 2006, that Jovita de Macasieb has been dead since October 16, 1968.\n\nComplainant alleged that respondent collaborated with an impostor in filing the two complaints for annulment of extra-judicial sale.\u00a0 Although the plaintiff in said complaints was referred to as JOVITA DE MACASIEB, the complaints however were signed by one JOVITA MACASIEB.\u00a0 Complainant argued that respondent intentionally resorted to this ploy in order to mislead the former.\u00a0 Since respondent was the one who notarized both complaints hence, he should know that JOVITA DE MACASIEB who was his aunt, and JOVITA MACASIEB who signed both complaints, are two different persons.\u00a0 Complainant averred that respondent's act of resurrecting a dead person not once but twice for the purpose of unjustly enriching themselves demonstrates a character not befitting a member of the legal profession.\n\nIn his Reply to complainant's Position Paper, respondent alleged that the only issue for resolution before the IBP is whether he violated the rule on forum shopping; that assuming the IBP could validly take cognizance of other issues, still it was complainant's fault that he transacted with an impostor; and that he did not know the person of Jovita Macasieb until the latter hired his services as lawyer.\n\nIn the Report and Recommendation of Investigating Commissioner Atty. Lolita A. Quisumbing, she found that respondent is not administratively liable for lack of showing that the filing of the second complaint was done deliberately and willfully to commit forum shopping. Thus:\nTo merit disciplinary action, forum shopping must be willful and deliberate. Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court requires that, should there be any pending action or claim before any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency, a complete statement of its status should be given.\n\nIn the present case, respondent explained his actions in this wise:\nIn the second complaint the respondent called the attention of the Court that there was a pending (sic) between the parties, Civil Case No. 2005-178. Hence, the purpose is not to obtain favorable decision, but to have the issue resolved in Civil Case No. 2005-178. To bring home his point, the respondent attached as Annex \"E\" the first complaint.\n\nThe respondent should not be blamed for the institution of the second complaint. He was misled by the very act of the complainant.\u00a0 Complainant had filed the application for foreclosure on December 20, 2004.\u00a0 This was the subject of Civil Case No. 178. All that he had to do was request the sheriff with whom he had filed the application to proceed with the foreclosure. There is absolutely no need for complainant to make a second application.\u00a0 In making the second application, it was impressed upon the mind of the respondent that it was another foreclosure.\nIn sum, respondent acted in good faith in filing the second complaint since it was established that it was his immediate reaction upon finding out that a second application for extrajudicial foreclosure was filed.\u00a0 If, indeed, there was intent to commit forum-shopping, he would not have alleged in the second complaint the fact of filing of the first complaint and attached a copy of the same.\n\nThe objective of the rule against forum-shopping was cited in Municipality of Taguig , et al vs. Court of Appeals .\u00a0 Said the Supreme Court -\nWhat is truly important to consider in determining whether forum shopping exists or not is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues.\nIn this case, no undue vexation was caused to the Court and petitioner as the fact of filing of the first case was alleged in the second complaint and secondly, soon thereafter, inasmuch as both cases were raffled to the same branch, the first case was dismissed by the said Court.\u00a0 Hence, there was no danger of different courts ruling on the same issues.\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, it is respectfully recommended that the Complaint against respondent ATTY. FELICIANO C. BAUTISTA be dismissed for lack of merit. (Citations omitted)\nThe Board of Governors of the IBP adopted and approved the findings and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in a Resolution dated February 6, 2008.\n\nOn June 2, 2008, complainant filed before this Court a Comment on the Resolution of the IBP Board of Governors with Motion for Reinvestigation. He claimed that forum shopping was not the sole issue raised for resolution but also respondent's alleged violation of the Oath of Attorney in relation to the Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility and for improper conduct. He argued that the IBP should have also discussed and resolved respondent's act of allegedly resurrecting Jovita de Macasieb from the dead and for allowing an impostor to impersonate the dead.\n\nThe Court notes that in paragraphs 1-10 of the complaint filed by Atty. Manipud before this Court, he narrated the antecedents which led to the filing of two complaints for annulment of extrajudicial sale by herein respondent. Then, in paragraphs 11-19, complainant concluded that respondent's acts amounted to forum shopping.\u00a0 Clearly, respondent is thus being charged only with commission of forum shopping in violation of his attorney's oath and in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and for improper conduct.\n\nEven assuming to be true complainant's allegation that he only learned on October 3, 2006, that the mortgagor, Jovita de Macasieb, has been dead since 1968, still he failed to raise this issue at the Mandatory Conference before the IBP where the issues were defined.\u00a0 The transcript of stenographic notes taken during the mandatory conference on September 13, 2007, long after complainant allegedly knew of the death of Jovita de Macasieb, shows that respondent's act of allegedly resurrecting Jovita de Macasieb from the dead and for allowing an impostor to impersonate the dead was never raised as an issue, thus:\nATTY. DECANO:\nThe proceeding before this Honorable Commissioner is whether there was a forum shopping.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nYes, the issue so will determine the relevance of that if you have any objection.\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nThere is therefore a relevant because it appears thru a representation...\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nYes, will be noted.\u00a0 State your objection.\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nIt is irrelevant, immaterial and is being of ....\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nYour Honor, I would like to mark as Exhibit \"D\" is the National Statistics Office showing that the plaintiff which was the counsel...respondent is already dead in October 16, 1968 to prove that the first complaint and the second complaint is tainted with fraud, Your Honor, and in violation of this attorney's oath of office.\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nWe object vigorously because that is not an issue before this Honorable Commission.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nThat is why pa\u00f1ero we are here for admissions, stipulation of facts, and definition of issues.\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nYes, but, Your Honor, ...\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nWe have to start first with the admissions and then we can proceed with the stipulations and issues.\u00a0 We can stipulate ultimately on what issue is before this Commission.\u00a0 It is not for the Commission to rule on those matters that you are presenting pa\u00f1ero.\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nBut it will had include this, Your Honor, in order to avoid nor filing of multiplicity of suit because if its that taken in this forum then another case will be filed.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nIt is not the proper forum, pa\u00f1ero.\u00a0 We are only limited on the issues that pertains to the conduct of among selves as a lawyer so we may proceed with the admissions and stipulations of facts and issues.\n\nATTY. MANIPUD:\nI think the 2 complaints and the Motion to Dismiss are documentary evidence to support forum shopping that I have marked. [1]\n\nx x x x\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nThe other allegations in this proposed stipulation of facts for being immaterial and irrelevant.\n\nCOMM. QUISUMBING:\nYou're not stipulating that respondent and plaintiff Jovita de Macasieb...\n\nATTY. DECANO:\nBecause this is a new issue and the Supreme Court delegated the Commissioner to subscribe only on the issues.\n\nCOMM.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ANTHONY C. DOMINGO AND GERRY DOMINGO, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.D E C I S I O N VELASCO JR., J.: This is an appeal by Anthony C. Domingo from the January 31, 2007 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00325. The CA affirmed the April 23, 2001 judgment[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 2 in Kalibo, Aklan, which found accused-appellant Anthony Domingo guilty of murder with frustrated murder in Criminal Case No. 5517. Accused-appellant Gerry Domingo has neither been arrested nor arraigned.The FactsAnthony was charged with murder and frustrated murder in an information that reads as follows:That on or about the 18th day of July, 1999, in the evening, in Barangay Cabugao, Municipality of Altavas, Province of Aklan, Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a long firearm, conspiring, confederating and helping each other, with evident premeditation, treachery and with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal gunshot wounds, to wit:The body of the deceased is in a state of rigor mortis. The body is dressed in a hospital gown with the name \"RAFAEL S. TUMBOKON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\" printed in front. The head has a bandage wrapped around the head. The right forearm has a small piece of plaster at the medial side at the level of the wrist.Gunshot wound of entrance, 1 cm. in diameter and 17 cms. Deep, located at the posterior right parietal region of the head, directed anteriorly and to the left.1 pellet, measuring 1 cm. in diameter, flatted and with irregular rough edges, was found at the left frontal region of the brain.as per Postmortem Examination Report issued by Dr. Gliceria A. Sucgang, Rural Health Physician, Altavas, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"A\" and forming an integral part of this Information, which gunshot wounds directly caused the death of said ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, as per Certificate of Death issued by the same physician, likewise attached hereto as Annex \"B\".That on the same incident and with the single act of the above-named accused, another victim, VIVIAN DOMINGO was hit, thereby inflicting upon the latter gunshot wounds, to wit:Left shoulder with metallic foreign bodyLeft arm, lateral and posterior thru and thruLeft hand, 3rd finger proximal 3rd with fracture of proximal phalanxAbdomen, hypogastric area left inferolateral portion with metallic foreign body abdominal wall.as per Medico-Legal report on Physical Injuries issued by Dr. Victor A. Santamaria, Medical Officer IV of the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital, Kalibo, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"G\" and forming an integral part of this Information; the accused having thus performed all the acts of execution which would produce the felony of Murder but did not produce the same for causes other than their own spontaneous desistance, that is, the timely and able medical attendance rendered to the victim which prevented her death.That as a result of the criminal acts of the accused, the heirs of the victim Rosemelyn De Pedro and private offended party Vivian Domingo suffered actual and compensatory damages in the amount of SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P 75,000.00).CONTRARY TO LAW.Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines, September 29, 1999.[3]The other accused, Gerry, went into hiding. Hence, only Anthony was arraigned on November 22, 1999. With the assistance of his counsel, he pleaded not guilty.[4]The plaintiff-appellee, through the Solicitor General, presented its version of the facts as follows: On July 18, 1999, around 8:00 p.m., Nida de Pedro Domingo, her two children, and seven nephews and nieces were at home in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan watching television. Their three dogs suddenly started to bark so Nida asked her niece, Rosemelyn de Pedro, to turn on the electric bulb that hang at the nearby mango tree beside the national road. When Rosemelyn did not budge, Nida herself turned on the lights, opened the bamboo window, and looked out of the window. She saw Anthony and Gerry, her brothers-in-law, standing under the mango tree. Without warning, Anthony and Gerry fired their pugakhang (homemade shotgun), hitting Nida in the right eyebrow. Rosemelyn, who was seated near the door with her back to the window, slumped on the floor with a wound in her head. Nida's daughter, Vivian, who was then combing her hair in front of the mirror, was hit on the left shoulder, left arm, left middle finger, and abdomen. When Vivian cried that she was hit, Nida immediately closed the window and shouted for help. The two accused fled towards Linayasan.[5]Prior to the incident, Nida's older brother, Leopoldo de Pedro, was on his way to Nida's house to fetch his grandchildren. He was about 12 meters away from the house when the dogs barked. He saw the light and heard an explosion which he mistook for thunder until he saw accused-appellants standing near the mango tree and holding a shotgun. Leopoldo ducked behind a pile of soil. He saw the two escaped to Linayasan.[6]Leopoldo, a certain Bobong, and Nonie were the first to respond to Nida's cries for help. Leopoldo testified that after the two accused left, he entered the house of Nida and saw his niece Rosemelyn lying on the floor while Vivian was assisted by other people. The victims were brought to the hospital.[7] Leopoldo, Bobong, and Nonie went to the police station to report the matter while Vivian stayed in the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital for five days. Rosemelyn died due to cerebral hemorrhage.[8]For the defense, Anthony testified that in the afternoon of July 18, 1999, he left his house with his two children and proceeded towards the house of his sister, Teresita Domingo, located in Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan, about half a kilometer away. Anthony's son stayed long at his sister's place as they were still going to Alfredo Dalida, Sr.'s house across the river.[9]In the evening, Alfredo was engaged in a drinking session with his friends in a hut located in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan. Gerry allegedly passed by the hut on his way to the house of his parent-in-law. Gerry refused the group's invitation to join the drinking session. Soon, Gerry's brother, Anthony, arrived at the hut. Alfredo accompanied Anthony to the former's house across the river of Dalipdip. Anthony wanted to talk to Alfredo's wife regarding the medical check-up of Anthony's wife in Manila who was due to arrive the following day. Since Anthony's children fell asleep while watching television, the Dalida spouses invited Anthony to pass the night in their house. Anthony and his children slept in the middle of the house which had no partition. Anthony alleged that he spent the entire night at the Dalida's.The morning after the incident, Anthony learned that Ronnie Domingo alias \"Kana\" was the initial suspect. Anthony denied the charges and alleged that he had never been to the house of Nida since he was charged with killing Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro. Anthony said that he even avoided passing there since the de Pedros had said that they will kill him. He remained in Altavas and continued farming until he was arrested three months after the incident.[10]Ronnie supported Anthony's defense and stated that he was the initial suspect in the shooting incident. He testified that on July 18, 1999, around 4:00 p.m., he was engaged in a drinking session at the store near councilwoman Gloria Marcelino's house. Because of drunkenness, he fell asleep at Gloria's place around 6:00 p.m. Around 7:00 p.m., he was awakened by Nida's shouts that it was \"Kana\" who shot her daughter and her niece. Ronnie was surprised at this accusation. Gloria told Nida not to suspect Ronnie because he was at her house sleeping at that time.[11]On April 23, 2001, the court a quo found Anthony guilty of murder with frustrated murder. The fallo of the decision reads:WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ANTHONY C. DOMINGO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of MURDER WITH FRUSTRATED MURDER, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of death.Further, the Court hereby orders the afore-named accused to pay the legal heirs of the victim ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO the following:P50,000.00 as civil indemnity ex delicto;P50,000.00 as moral damages; andP10,805.00 as actual damages supported with receipts only.Further, the Court hereby orders that the cases against GERRY C. DOMINGO be ARCHIVED until his arrest.With COSTS against Anthony C. Domingo.SO ORDERED.[12]In view of the imposition of the death penalty, the case was forwarded to the CA for review.[13]In the appellant's brief, [14] Anthony reiterated his alibi. He also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses. For one, Nida claimed that the window was open at the time of the shooting which contradicts Vivian's testimony that the window was closed. Also, according to Anthony, the inaction of Gina de Pedro, Nida's niece, during the incident was contrary to human nature. Gina's allegation that there was only one shot also contradicts the prosecution's evidence showing four gunshot wounds on Vivian, two deformed pellets, and one plastic cap recovered from the crime scene. He also contended that since Leopoldo was not among the first to respond to Nida's cries for help, he could not have been at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. Lastly, Anthony attributed ill motive to the prosecution witnesses since they charged him of killing Tenorio, Nida's brother.The Ruling of the CAThe CA found no merit in Anthony's contentions. In reviewing the testimonies of the witnesses, the appellate court found no inconsistencies that would question their credibility. For one, the window was initially closed as testified to by Nida, but she later opened it when Rosemelyn did not follow her order. The CA also held that Gina's inaction when the shot was fired was also understandable since she was in shock. Gina's testimony that there was only one fire does not contradict the physical evidence, since a single bullet of a shotgun can fire several pellets that can cause multiple injuries. As to whether Leopoldo de Pedro was at the crime scene, the CA found that Leopoldo stayed behind a pile of soil for three more minutes after the attack for fear that accused-appellants might see him. The fact that he was not among the first to arrive at Nida's side does not mean that he was not at the crime scene or that he did not witness the attack. The CA also dismissed Anthony's alibi and imputation of ill motive on the prosecution witnesses.With regard to the damages, however, the CA found it appropriate to order the payment of exemplary damages in the amount of PhP 25,000 since treachery was proved. Furthermore, in view of Republic Act No. 9346, the imposition of the death penalty was proscribed. Thus, the trial court's judgment was amended as follows:WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, Branch 2, dated 23 April 2003, in Criminal Case No. 5517 is UPHELD with modification only as to the penalty and award of civil damages. Accordingly, accused-appellant Anthony C. Domingo is hereby sentenced to suffer Reclusion Perpetua in lieu of death and is further ordered to pay the heirs of Rosemelyn De Pedro the amount of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in addition to those awarded by the trial court.[15]Assignment of ErrorsTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE AND SELF-CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION'S ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES.THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.The Court's RulingThe appeal lacks merit.We find no reason to disturb the findings of fact of the trial court. It is an established rule that findings of the trial court on such matters will not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misinterpreted which would otherwise materially affect the disposition of the case.[16] In this case, we do not see any reason to depart from this rule.The trial court gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who positively identified Anthony as the culprit. Nida, Leopoldo, and Gina knew Anthony before the incident and ably recognized him at the time of the shooting. Anthony claims, however, that Nida and Gina could not have seen the attacker since the window was closed as testified by Vivian. Leopoldo could not have also seen the attacker since he was not the first to arrive at Nida's house.We agree with the appellate court that there is no contradiction in the testimonies of Vivian and Nida. Before the shooting, the window was indeed closed, but when Nida heard the dogs barked, Nida opened the window. Nida testified as follows:PROSECUTOR DEL ROSARIO:Q: Mrs. Witness, do you remember where [you were] in the evening of July 18, 1999 at around 8:00 o'clock?A: I was in the house.x x x xQ: What were you doing [in] your house?A: I was watching T.V.Q: Do you have companion in your house?A: My children and some of my nephews and nieces.Q: While you were watching T.V. was there any unusual incident that happened?A: Yes, Sir.Q: Please tell the Court what was that incident?A: Our dog barked.Q: After you heard your dog [barking], what did you do?A: I asked Rosemelyn to switch on the light outside.Q: [Was] Rosemelyn able to switch on the light as you instructed her?A: She did not listen because she continued watching T.V.Q: What did you do after Rosemelyn did not listen to you?A: I was the one [who] stood up to switch on the light and to open the window.Q: After you opened the window and switched the light, were you able to observe anything outside?A: Yes, sir.Q: Please tell the Court what you have observed?A: I saw Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo outside.[17]The Solicitor General also points out that at the time of the shooting, Vivian was facing the mirror and combing her hair. It was Gina and Nida who were near the window. Thus, the latter's testimonies carry more weight than Vivian's. Assuming that such a discrepancy exists, it is trivial and does not warrant the reversal of judgment. In People v. Ave, we held:It is elementary that not all inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony affect their credibility. Inconsistencies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration, their veracity, or the weight of their testimonies. Thus, although there may be inconsistencies on the testimonies of witnesses on minor details, the same do not impair the credibility of the witnesses where there is consistency in relating the principal occurrence and positive identification of the assailants.[18]In this case, Nida firmly stated that she saw accused-appellants fire at her. She testified as follows:ATTY. IBUTNANDE:Q: How long have you noticed the presence of Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo before you heard the gunfire?A: Immediately after I opened the window, I saw them and thereafter I heard a gunfire.Q: So, when they fired the gun you are still standing by the window, that is what you are trying to say?A: The moment they fired and I was hit in my eye, I tried to sit on the chair.[19]We further affirm the lower courts' reliance on the testimony of Leopoldo, specifically, that the latter was at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. He was not among the first to arrive at Nida's house because he hid behind a pile of soil for three minutes after the shooting incident. He testified as follows:ATTY. IBUTNANDE:Q: How long did you duck in that pile of soil before you stood up to go up of the house of your sister Nida Domingo?A: Three (3) minutes, more or less.Q: It took you three minutes, more or less, because you were afraid to show up by that pile of soil because you were afraid that you might be seen by Anthony Domingo and his companion, am I correct?A: Yes, ma'am.[20]Anthony further seeks to discredit Gina by pointing out her unnatural reaction to the shooting, i.e., that she remained standing by the open window during and even after the shooting incident. The 12-year-old girl was simply in shock, as observed by the appellate court. In People v. Muyco, we held:Different people react differently to a given type of situation. There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. One person's spontaneous or unthinking, or even instinctive response to a horrid and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while another person's reaction may be cold indifference. A witness' inability to move, help or even to run away when the incident occurs is not a ground to label his testimony as doubtful and unworthy of belief. There is no prescribed behavior when one is faced with a shocking event.[21]Also, Gina's testimony that she heard only one shot does not contradict the physical evidence of four gunshot wounds and two pellet caps recovered from the crime scene. The CA correctly held that a shotgun can fire a single bullet with several pellets that can cause multiple injuries or deaths.[22]Anthony's alibi, that he was at Alfredo Dalida's house, has no merit. Alibi is the weakest of defenses. To exonerate an accused, one must show that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the offense and that he was so far removed from the crime scene or its immediate vicinity that it could not have been possible for him to have committed the crime.[23] In this case, the trial court found that the house of Alfredo Dalida, Sr. was only 200 meters away from the crime scene. Such short distance makes it physically possible for Anthony to be at the scene of the crime. The Court has patiently reiterated the requisites for alibi to prosper, that is, the accused was not at the locus delictiwhen the offense was committed and it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission.[24] Anthony failed to comply with the time and distance requisites of alibi.Anthony claims that Nida Domingo's initial suspect was Ronnie Domingo. He says that Nida went to the house of Gloria Marcelino after the incident to look for Ronnie. The Solicitor General points out, however, that at the time, Nida herself needed medical treatment for her injuries. Nida's daughter, Vivian, was also wounded and had to be rushed to the hospital. In rebuttal, Nida denied that she ever told Gloria that Ronnie shot Vivian and Rosemelyn. Considering these, we find that Anthony's claim is not worthy of belief.Anthony further imputes ill motive on the prosecution witnesses, claiming that they blame him for the death of Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro; thus, their testimonies are not worthy of belief. It is doctrinal that the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of a witness and his or her testimony is accorded the highest respect because of the court's untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness and, thus, to determine whether he or she is telling the truth. It is also settled that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court.[25] In this case, both courts found that the eyewitnesses are credible. We do not see any reason to disregard such finding. We concur with the trial court's findings:The Court cannot find any well-grounded basis that will indicate that these eyewitnesses were merely actuated by any improper motive.It is utterly preposterous for these relatives of the victims who are crying for justice to merely pretend to have seen the subject heinous event and then concoct a story that will allow the real culprits to remain free just to be able to callously implicate the innocent persons that they hate.Moreover, considering the dangerous trait of accused Anthony C. Domingo and the circumstance that Gerry C. Domingo is still at large, it is highly improbably that they would dare hurl false accusations against them.[26]The Solicitor General also notes that at the time of the incident, there was already a criminal case against Anthony for the death of Tenorio de Pedro; hence, there was no need for the relatives to prosecute him anew if only to get even with him.[27] More significantly, settled is the rule that motive is not essential to conviction when there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprit. Motive is not essential when there are reliable eyewitnesses who fully identified the accused as the perpetrator of the offense,[28] as in the case at bar.With regard to damages, we raise the award of civil indemnity from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000; and moral damages from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000 for the death of Rosemelyn de Pedro, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence. We affirm the trial court's award of PhP 10,805 as actual damages based on the supporting receipts. The trial court held that the aggravating circumstances of treachery and dwelling were present, but failed to award any exemplary damages. While the appellate court was correct in adding exemplary damages, we deem it proper to raise the award from PhP 25,000 to PhP 30,000. Since the death penalty was proscribed by law, the sentence of reclusion perpetua was also correct.WHEREFORE, the CA Decision dated January 31, 2007 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00325 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Anthony C. Domingo is ordered to indemnify the victim's heirs with PhP 75,000 civil indemnity, PhP 75,000 moral damages, and PhP 30,000 exemplary damages.

Accused-appellant Gerry Domingo has neither been arrested nor arraigned.\n\nThe Facts\n\nAnthony was charged with murder and frustrated murder in an information that reads as follows:\n\nThat on or about the 18 th day of July, 1999, in the evening, in Barangay Cabugao, Municipality of Altavas, Province of Aklan, Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a long firearm, conspiring, confederating and helping each other, with evident premeditation, treachery and with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal gunshot wounds, to wit:\n\nThe body of the deceased is in a state of rigor mortis. The body is dressed in a hospital gown with the name \"RAFAEL S. TUMBOKON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\" printed in front. The head has a bandage wrapped around the head. The right forearm has a small piece of plaster at the medial side at the level of the wrist.\n\nGunshot wound of entrance, 1 cm. in diameter and 17 cms. Deep, located at the posterior right parietal region of the head, directed anteriorly and to the left.\n\n1 pellet, measuring 1 cm. in diameter, flatted and with irregular rough edges, was found at the left frontal region of the brain.\n\nas per Postmortem Examination Report issued by Dr. Gliceria A. Sucgang, Rural Health Physician, Altavas, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"A\" and forming an integral part of this Information, which gunshot wounds directly caused the death of said ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO, as per Certificate of Death issued by the same physician, likewise attached hereto as Annex \"B\".\n\nThat on the same incident and with the single act of the above-named accused, another victim, VIVIAN DOMINGO was hit, thereby inflicting upon the latter gunshot wounds, to wit:\n\nLeft shoulder with metallic foreign body\n\nLeft arm, lateral and posterior thru and thru\n\nLeft hand, 3 rd finger proximal 3 rd with fracture of proximal phalanx\n\nAbdomen, hypogastric area left inferolateral portion with metallic foreign body abdominal wall.\nas per Medico-Legal report on Physical Injuries issued by Dr. Victor A. Santamaria, Medical Officer IV of the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital, Kalibo, Aklan, hereto attached as Annex \"G\" and forming an integral part of this Information; the accused having thus performed all the acts of execution which would produce the felony of Murder but did not produce the same for causes other than their own spontaneous desistance, that is, the timely and able medical attendance rendered to the victim which prevented her death.\n\nThat as a result of the criminal acts of the accused, the heirs of the victim Rosemelyn De Pedro and private offended party Vivian Domingo suffered actual and compensatory damages in the amount of SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P 75,000.00).\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nKalibo, Aklan, Philippines, September 29, 1999. [3]\n\nThe other accused, Gerry, went into hiding. Hence, only Anthony was arraigned on November 22, 1999. With the assistance of his counsel, he pleaded not guilty. [4]\n\nThe plaintiff-appellee, through the Solicitor General, presented its version of the facts as follows: On July 18, 1999, around 8:00 p.m., Nida de Pedro Domingo, her two children, and seven nephews and nieces were at home in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan watching television. Their three dogs suddenly started to bark so Nida asked her niece, Rosemelyn de Pedro, to turn on the electric bulb that hang at the nearby mango tree beside the national road. When Rosemelyn did not budge, Nida herself turned on the lights, opened the bamboo window, and looked out of the window. She saw Anthony and Gerry, her brothers-in-law, standing under the mango tree. Without warning, Anthony and Gerry fired their pugakhang (homemade shotgun), hitting Nida in the right eyebrow. Rosemelyn, who was seated near the door with her back to the window, slumped on the floor with a wound in her head. Nida's daughter, Vivian, who was then combing her hair in front of the mirror, was hit on the left shoulder, left arm, left middle finger, and abdomen. When Vivian cried that she was hit, Nida immediately closed the window and shouted for help. The two accused fled towards Linayasan. [5]\n\nPrior to the incident, Nida's older brother, Leopoldo de Pedro, was on his way to Nida's house to fetch his grandchildren. He was about 12 meters away from the house when the dogs barked. He saw the light and heard an explosion which he mistook for thunder until he saw accused-appellants standing near the mango tree and holding a shotgun. Leopoldo ducked behind a pile of soil. He saw the two escaped to Linayasan. [6]\n\nLeopoldo, a certain Bobong, and Nonie were the first to respond to Nida's cries for help. Leopoldo testified that after the two accused left, he entered the house of Nida and saw his niece Rosemelyn lying on the floor while Vivian was assisted by other people. The victims were brought to the hospital. [7] Leopoldo, Bobong, and Nonie went to the police station to report the matter while Vivian stayed in the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital for five days. Rosemelyn died due to cerebral hemorrhage. [8]\n\nFor the defense, Anthony testified that in the afternoon of July 18, 1999, he left his house with his two children and proceeded towards the house of his sister, Teresita Domingo, located in Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan, about half a kilometer away. Anthony's son stayed long at his sister's place as they were still going to Alfredo Dalida, Sr.'s house across the river. [9]\n\nIn the evening, Alfredo was engaged in a drinking session with his friends in a hut located in Barangay Cabugao, Altavas, Aklan. Gerry allegedly passed by the hut on his way to the house of his parent-in-law. Gerry refused the group's invitation to join the drinking session. Soon, Gerry's brother, Anthony, arrived at the hut. Alfredo accompanied Anthony to the former's house across the river of Dalipdip. Anthony wanted to talk to Alfredo's wife regarding the medical check-up of Anthony's wife in Manila who was due to arrive the following day. Since Anthony's children fell asleep while watching television, the Dalida spouses invited Anthony to pass the night in their house. Anthony and his children slept in the middle of the house which had no partition. Anthony alleged that he spent the entire night at the Dalida's.\n\nThe morning after the incident, Anthony learned that Ronnie Domingo alias \"Kana\" was the initial suspect. Anthony denied the charges and alleged that he had never been to the house of Nida since he was charged with killing Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro. Anthony said that he even avoided passing there since the de Pedros had said that they will kill him. He remained in Altavas and continued farming until he was arrested three months after the incident. [10]\n\nRonnie supported Anthony's defense and stated that he was the initial suspect in the shooting incident. He testified that on July 18, 1999, around 4:00 p.m., he was engaged in a drinking session at the store near councilwoman Gloria Marcelino's house. Because of drunkenness, he fell asleep at Gloria's place around 6:00 p.m. Around 7:00 p.m., he was awakened by Nida's shouts that it was \"Kana\" who shot her daughter and her niece. Ronnie was surprised at this accusation. Gloria told Nida not to suspect Ronnie because he was at her house sleeping at that time. [11]\n\nOn April 23, 2001, the court a quo found Anthony guilty of murder with frustrated murder. The fallo of the decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ANTHONY C. DOMINGO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of MURDER WITH FRUSTRATED MURDER, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of death.\n\nFurther, the Court hereby orders the afore-named accused to pay the legal heirs of the victim ROSEMELYN DE PEDRO the following:\n\nP50,000.00 as civil indemnity ex delicto;\n\nP50,000.00 as moral damages; and\n\nP10,805.00 as actual damages supported with receipts only.\nFurther, the Court hereby orders that the cases against GERRY C. DOMINGO be ARCHIVED until his arrest.\n\nWith COSTS against Anthony C. Domingo.\n\nSO ORDERED. [12]\nIn view of the imposition of the death penalty, the case was forwarded to the CA for review. [13]\n\nIn the appellant's brief, [14] Anthony reiterated his alibi. He also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses. For one, Nida claimed that the window was open at the time of the shooting which contradicts Vivian's testimony that the window was closed. Also, according to Anthony, the inaction of Gina de Pedro, Nida's niece, during the incident was contrary to human nature. Gina's allegation that there was only one shot also contradicts the prosecution's evidence showing four gunshot wounds on Vivian, two deformed pellets, and one plastic cap recovered from the crime scene. He also contended that since Leopoldo was not among the first to respond to Nida's cries for help, he could not have been at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. Lastly, Anthony attributed ill motive to the prosecution witnesses since they charged him of killing Tenorio, Nida's brother.\n\nThe Ruling of the CA\n\nThe CA found no merit in Anthony's contentions. In reviewing the testimonies of the witnesses, the appellate court found no inconsistencies that would question their credibility. For one, the window was initially closed as testified to by Nida, but she later opened it when Rosemelyn did not follow her order. The CA also held that Gina's inaction when the shot was fired was also understandable since she was in shock. Gina's testimony that there was only one fire does not contradict the physical evidence, since a single bullet of a shotgun can fire several pellets that can cause multiple injuries. As to whether Leopoldo de Pedro was at the crime scene, the CA found that Leopoldo stayed behind a pile of soil for three more minutes after the attack for fear that accused-appellants might see him. The fact that he was not among the first to arrive at Nida's side does not mean that he was not at the crime scene or that he did not witness the attack. The CA also dismissed Anthony's alibi and imputation of ill motive on the prosecution witnesses.\n\nWith regard to the damages, however, the CA found it appropriate to order the payment of exemplary damages in the amount of PhP 25,000 since treachery was proved. Furthermore, in view of Republic Act No. 9346, the imposition of the death penalty was proscribed. Thus, the trial court's judgment was amended as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, Branch 2, dated 23 April 2003, in Criminal Case No. 5517 is UPHELD with modification only as to the penalty and award of civil damages. Accordingly, accused-appellant Anthony C. Domingo is hereby sentenced to suffer Reclusion Perpetua in lieu of death and is further ordered to pay the heirs of Rosemelyn De Pedro the amount of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in addition to those awarded by the trial court. [15]\nAssignment of Errors\nTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE AND SELF-CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION'S ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES.\n\nTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe appeal lacks merit.\n\nWe find no reason to disturb the findings of fact of the trial court. It is an established rule that findings of the trial court on such matters will not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misinterpreted which would otherwise materially affect the disposition of the case. [16] In this case, we do not see any reason to depart from this rule.\n\nThe trial court gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who positively identified Anthony as the culprit. Nida, Leopoldo, and Gina knew Anthony before the incident and ably recognized him at the time of the shooting. Anthony claims, however, that Nida and Gina could not have seen the attacker since the window was closed as testified by Vivian. Leopoldo could not have also seen the attacker since he was not the first to arrive at Nida's house.\n\nWe agree with the appellate court that there is no contradiction in the testimonies of Vivian and Nida. Before the shooting, the window was indeed closed, but when Nida heard the dogs barked, Nida opened the window. Nida testified as follows:\n\nPROSECUTOR DEL ROSARIO:\n\nQ: Mrs. Witness, do you remember where [you were] in the evening of July 18, 1999 at around 8:00 o'clock?\nA: I was in the house.\nx x x x\nQ: What were you doing [in] your house?\nA: I was watching T.V.\nQ: Do you have companion in your house?\nA: My children and some of my nephews and nieces.\nQ: While you were watching T.V. was there any unusual incident that happened?\nA: Yes, Sir.\nQ: Please tell the Court what was that incident?\nA: Our dog barked.\nQ: After you heard your dog [barking], what did you do?\nA: I asked Rosemelyn to switch on the light outside.\nQ: [Was] Rosemelyn able to switch on the light as you instructed her?\nA: She did not listen because she continued watching T.V.\nQ: What did you do after Rosemelyn did not listen to you?\nA: I was the one [who] stood up to switch on the light and to open the window.\nQ: After you opened the window and switched the light, were you able to observe anything outside?\nA: Yes, sir.\nQ: Please tell the Court what you have observed?\nA: I saw Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo outside. [17]\nThe Solicitor General also points out that at the time of the shooting, Vivian was facing the mirror and combing her hair. It was Gina and Nida who were near the window. Thus, the latter's testimonies carry more weight than Vivian's. Assuming that such a discrepancy exists, it is trivial and does not warrant the reversal of judgment. In People v. Ave , we held:\n\nIt is elementary that not all inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony affect their credibility. Inconsistencies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration, their veracity, or the weight of their testimonies. Thus, although there may be inconsistencies on the testimonies of witnesses on minor details, the same do not impair the credibility of the witnesses where there is consistency in relating the principal occurrence and positive identification of the assailants. [18]\nIn this case, Nida firmly stated that she saw accused-appellants fire at her. She testified as follows:\n\nATTY. IBUTNANDE:\n\nQ: How long have you noticed the presence of Gerry Domingo and Anthony Domingo before you heard the gunfire?\n\nA: Immediately after I opened the window, I saw them and thereafter I heard a gunfire.\n\nQ: So, when they fired the gun you are still standing by the window, that is what you are trying to say?\n\nA: The moment they fired and I was hit in my eye, I tried to sit on the chair. [19]\nWe further affirm the lower courts' reliance on the testimony of Leopoldo, specifically, that the latter was at the crime scene and witnessed the attack. He was not among the first to arrive at Nida's house because he hid behind a pile of soil for three minutes after the shooting incident. He testified as follows:\n\nATTY. IBUTNANDE:\n\nQ: How long did you duck in that pile of soil before you stood up to go up of the house of your sister Nida Domingo?\n\nA: Three (3) minutes, more or less.\n\nQ: It took you three minutes, more or less, because you were afraid to show up by that pile of soil because you were afraid that you might be seen by Anthony Domingo and his companion, am I correct?\n\nA: Yes, ma'am. [20]\nAnthony further seeks to discredit Gina by pointing out her unnatural reaction to the shooting, i.e., that she remained standing by the open window during and even after the shooting incident. The 12-year-old girl was simply in shock, as observed by the appellate court. In People v. Muyco , we held:\n\nDifferent people react differently to a given type of situation. There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. One person's spontaneous or unthinking, or even instinctive response to a horrid and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while another person's reaction may be cold indifference. A witness' inability to move, help or even to run away when the incident occurs is not a ground to label his testimony as doubtful and unworthy of belief. There is no prescribed behavior when one is faced with a shocking event. [21]\nAlso, Gina's testimony that she heard only one shot does not contradict the physical evidence of four gunshot wounds and two pellet caps recovered from the crime scene. The CA correctly held that a shotgun can fire a single bullet with several pellets that can cause multiple injuries or deaths. [22]\n\nAnthony's alibi, that he was at Alfredo Dalida's house, has no merit. Alibi is the weakest of defenses. To exonerate an accused, one must show that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the offense and that he was so far removed from the crime scene or its immediate vicinity that it could not have been possible for him to have committed the crime. [23] In this case, the trial court found that the house of Alfredo Dalida, Sr. was only 200 meters away from the crime scene. Such short distance makes it physically possible for Anthony to be at the scene of the crime. The Court has patiently reiterated the requisites for alibi to prosper, that is, the accused was not at the locus delicti when the offense was committed and it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission. [24] Anthony failed to comply with the time and distance requisites of alibi.\n\nAnthony claims that Nida Domingo's initial suspect was Ronnie Domingo. He says that Nida went to the house of Gloria Marcelino after the incident to look for Ronnie. The Solicitor General points out, however, that at the time, Nida herself needed medical treatment for her injuries. Nida's daughter, Vivian, was also wounded and had to be rushed to the hospital. In rebuttal, Nida denied that she ever told Gloria that Ronnie shot Vivian and Rosemelyn. Considering these, we find that Anthony's claim is not worthy of belief.\n\nAnthony further imputes ill motive on the prosecution witnesses, claiming that they blame him for the death of Nida's brother, Tenorio de Pedro; thus, their testimonies are not worthy of belief. It is doctrinal that the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of a witness and his or her testimony is accorded the highest respect because of the court's untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness and, thus, to determine whether he or she is telling the truth. It is also settled that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court. [25] In this case, both courts found that the eyewitnesses are credible. We do not see any reason to disregard such finding. We concur with the trial court's findings:\n\nThe Court cannot find any well-grounded basis that will indicate that these eyewitnesses were merely actuated by any improper motive.\n\nIt is utterly preposterous for these relatives of the victims who are crying for justice to merely pretend to have seen the subject heinous event and then concoct a story that will allow the real culprits to remain free just to be able to callously implicate the innocent persons that they hate.\n\nMoreover, considering the dangerous trait of accused Anthony C. Domingo and the circumstance that Gerry C. Domingo is still at large, it is highly improbably that they would dare hurl false accusations against them. [26]\nThe Solicitor General also notes that at the time of the incident, there was already a criminal case against Anthony for the death of Tenorio de Pedro; hence, there was no need for the relatives to prosecute him anew if only to get even with him. [27] More significantly, settled is the rule that motive is not essential to conviction when there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprit. Motive is not essential when there are reliable eyewitnesses who fully identified the accused as the perpetrator of the offense, [28] as in the case at bar.\n\nWith regard to damages, we raise the award of civil indemnity from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000; and moral damages from PhP 50,000 to PhP 75,000 for the death of Rosemelyn de Pedro, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence. We affirm the trial court's award of PhP 10,805 as actual damages based on the supporting receipts. The trial court held that the aggravating circumstances of treachery and dwelling were present, but failed to award any exemplary damages. While the appellate court was correct in adding exemplary damages, we deem it proper to raise the award from PhP 25,000 to PhP 30,000. Since the death penalty was proscribed by law, the sentence of reclusion perpetua was also correct.\n\nWHEREFORE , the CA Decision dated January 31, 2007 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00325 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Anthony C. Domingo is ordered to indemnify the victim's heirs with PhP 75,000 civil indemnity, PhP 75,000 moral damages, and PhP 30,000 exemplary damages.

Orocio, to determine and find out the names and number of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolution(s) No. 2002-124 and 2002-125, and the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory, including the totality of the said amounts for the purpose of determining the 10% charging lien of Attorneys Aldon and Orocio, by summoning and issuing proper subpoenas to the Vice-Pres., Human Resources and to the Senior Department Manager for Finance of the NPC and directing the said responsible NPC officials to make and submit such list and computations under oath;(2) Directing/Ordering the said Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City after and on the basis of the said list and computations submitted by said NPC officials, to issue the corresponding writ of execution; and(3) Directing said Office to undertake any and all actions necessary to implement and execute the decision and resolution in this case thru said writ of execution and, thereafter, to submit a report thereon to this Court.[9]Finding petitioners' Motion for Urgent Execution meritorious, we granted the same per resolution dated 10 December 2008, and issued the following order: The Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation (NPC) to cause the preparation of a list, under oath, of (a) the names of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, and (b) the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory. From the totality of the amounts due to the illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, the same officers are directed to compute the 10% charging lien thereon of Atty. Cornelio P. Aldon (Aldon) and Atty. Victoriano V. Orocio (Orocio) pursuant to the Resolution dated 17 September 2008 of this Court;The Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to pay or cause to be paid immediately the amounts due to the petitioners and all other illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, as well as the amount of charging lien to Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio, in accordance with the list and computations prepared under oath pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof; andThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to respectively submit proof of their compliance of the orders of this Court as stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution.[10]In their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners asked the Court to: (1) cite the Chairman and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC in contempt for their willful failure to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution dated 10 December 2008 which is a mockery of the Court's Order and gross disrespect of its authority; (2) appoint the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, together with his/her deputies, to enforce by execution the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishing/levying upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the responsible NPC officials hereafter to be summoned; (3) immediately summon the concerned and responsible NPC officials, namely: Mr. Eduardo P. Elroy, Vice-President, Human Resources, Mr. Paquito F. Garcia, Sr., Department Manager, Human Resources & Administration and Ms. Wilma V. Ortega, Manager, Compensation and Benefits Management Division (CBMD), Human Resources Department, NPC, to attest jointly and severally under oath as to the existence of a 212-page list[11] containing the names of NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated from the service as a result of the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 with the amounts due to them and the charging lien due Attys. Orocio and Aldon, and to submit under oath jointly and severally the certified true copies thereof to the Court.[12]On 11 February 2009, Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo, through counsel Casan B. Macabanding, filed a Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution. They informed the Court that demand letters have been sent to the National Power Board and to the NPC showing the computations of the amount due each of them. Despite this, no action has been taken thereon. They therefore ask that an order be issued directing the Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon and/or Sheriff of Lanao del Sur, 12th Judicial Region, Marawi City, to seize and attach cash and properties of the NPC and to apply the same to their claim of P16,120,706.00, and to deduct therefrom the attorney's lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio.[13]On 17 February 2009, the NPC asked for additional 30 days to address the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008[14] which petitioners opposed.[15]On 25 February 2009, PSALM filed a Manifestation stating that petitioners did not furnish it a copy of their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 wherein they prayed that the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City be appointed to enforce the Court's Resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. Not being a party in the case, PSALM said it is not bound by the judgment rendered by the Court. It added that PSALM is mandated to privatize the transferred NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and to apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of all existing and outstanding NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. Nothing in the EPIRA[16] allows garnishment and levy of PSALM's assets to satisfy a judgment against NPC. Petitioners are not employees of PSALM but of respondent NPC. PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees for it is not one of those liabilities transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM at the effectivity of the EPIRA. It explains that since the privatization proceeds are earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM, same are not within the reach of any execution and garnishment. The garnishment and/or levying of PSALM's assets and privatization proceeds will amount to diverting them for the purpose originally contemplated by the EPIRA. Such garnishment and/or levy will amount to a disbursement without proper appropriation as required by law. Finally, it argues that the present executory course of action taken by petitioners is a deviation from the Court's Resolution dated 17 September 2008 which leaves the computation of the actual amounts due them and the enforcement of payment thereof to the proper forum in appropriate proceedings for the Court is not a trier of facts.[17]In its Compliance[18] dated 9 March 2009, NPC informed the Court that only the services of its top level employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 contrary to the submissions made by petitioner in its Manifestation and Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009. More specifically, it said only the services of sixteen (16) NPC employees occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager, were terminated on 31 January 2003, but were rehired on 1 February 2003 after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA. It explained that any additional payment of separation pay, backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees would be iniquitous and would constitute unjust enrichment as they were never unemployed.It further stated that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 were nullified because they were signed by alternates. This infirmity, it explained, was rectified and effectively mooted with the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55[19] dated 14 September 2007 which adopted, confirmed and approved the principles and guidelines enunciated in NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It likewise pointed out that the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court.On 13 March 2009, petitioners filed a Counter-Manifestation[20] to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009 stating that a writ of execution may be issued against non-parties, including the PSALM, under, among others, the following situations: (1) one who is privy to the judgment debtor; (2) a successor-in-interest; and (3) under the principle of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. Petitioners explained that PSALM is privy to NPC because the former was principally organized to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and Independent Power Producers (IPP) contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. PSALM, also being a successor-in-interest of NPC, is now the owner of the financial obligations/liabilities of NPC and shall be considered as one with NPC and the liability of the latter shall attach to the former. Further, it said PSALM is a mere alter ego or business conduit of NPC as evidenced by the fact that majority of the members of the NPB also constitutes the majority of the PSALM Board and that the NPB and the PSALM Board have held joint board meetings to resist payment in relation to the 10 December 2008 Resolution. Petitioners disclosed that the NPB and the PSALM Board recently issued a joint letter-instruction to the power consumers of NPC that all payments for power sales shall be directly remitted to PSALM. They further claimed that this letter-instruction violates the EPIRA Law because the payment for power sales to NPC is not enumerated among the funds, assets, contribution and other properties that constitute the property of PSALM, and that these payments constitute gross income revenue and not net profits of NPC. As a garnishee, PSALM need not be summoned or impleaded as a party to the case.On 24 March 2009, petitioners filed their Comment/Manifestation and Urgent Motions (1) To include for Contempt Respondents' Counsels and (2) To Summon the Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration, NPC to Attest and Certify Certain Official Documents.[21] Petitioners point out that respondents, in their compliance, raise two new issues, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125.On the first issue, petitioners explain that respondents' misrepresentation that there were only 16 NPC personnel whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003 is true but is only half-true. They have intentionally suppressed and conveniently omitted in their Compliance to mention and inform the Court of the fact that while under NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003, for various reasons, their actual termination was effected on different dates, as follows: (a) top executives - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. In support thereof, they mentioned NPB Resolution No. 2003-11, NPC Circular No. 2003-09 and the Memorandum dated 26 February 2009 of Dr. Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration (HRA), NPC. They revealed that NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 is one of the resolutions ratified and confirmed by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.As to the second issue, petitioners argue that since NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect, the same cannot be rectified and ratified since only voidable acts can be validated.In our Resolution dated 15 April 2009, the Court, among other things, required NPC to file its Comment on Petitioner's Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. The Court deferred action on petitioners' motion for implementation of the issued writ of execution dated 10 February 2009 pending filing by NPC of the afore-said comments.[22]On 5 May 2009, PSALM filed a Submission to petitioners' Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009.[23] It argued that a writ of execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court. It said it is neither a successor-in-interest nor an alter-ego or business conduit of NPC. Being employees of NPC, PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. It claims that petitioners' claim on the supposed conduct of joint board meetings of NPC and PSALM Boards is purely conjectural and without factual basis. The sending of letters to distribution utilities, like MERALCO, is a consequence of the implementation of the EPIRA as to the ownership by PSALM of all NPC generation assets, IPP Contracts, etc. On the claim that payment for power sales by customers are not one of those under the EPIRA as constituting properties of PSALM and that they constitute gross income and not net profits of NPC, PSALM argues that same is absurd because as owner of the generation assets, it is entitled to the income derived from the sale of electricity. Said income partakes of the nature of fruits which belong to the owner of the asset. Finally, it argued that not being a party in the case or judgment debtor, its properties cannot be garnished.On 27 May 2009, petitioners Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo filed a Manifestation and Motion reiterating their prayer in their Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution motion dated 11 February 2009.[24]On 28 May 2009, respondent NPC filed its Consolidated Comment[25] on Petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009.On PSALM's Manifestation, NPC agreed with PSALM that execution of its properties is improper as it is not a party in the case.On petitioners' Manifestation and Comment, NPC contends that petitioners are either confused or deviously sneaking into the present controversy facts, issues and reliefs that have not been litigated or resolved in the instant case. It argues that it involves the nullification of NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 did not affect the reorganization of the NPC because other resolutions pursuant thereto remain valid. The Court even declared in its 17 September 2008 Resolution that the \"NPC can still pursue its reorganization although it cannot implement the same by terminating petitioners' employment on 31 January 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and 2002-125.\" Under Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, only the services of 16 top level employees were terminated. As admitted by petitioners, the services of other NPC employees were terminated on 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11. The validity of this latter resolution has not been the subject of the present controversy.On 5 June 2009, petitioners filed their Reply to NPC's Consolidated Comment.[26] Petitioners reiterated their Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009 to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. In addition, they explained that the purpose of the EPIRA in creating PSALM is to sell and dispose the assets of NPC and to use the proceeds therefrom to liquidate all the financial obligations and liabilities of the NPC. It quoted Congressman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella's opinion which was in response to a legal opinion of Cyril C. del Callar, former NPC President, as to the function of PSALM. The opinion partly reads: The function of PSALM is limited and akin to that of a liquidator of NPC assets as stated in Section 50 of the EPIRA that the principal purpose of PSALM is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the end in view of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.Petitioners insists it is the NPC and its counsel (Office of the Solicitor General), not them, that are guilty of raising new issues without valid and legal justification. They explained that the Court had settled the following issues: (1) NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect; (2) as a consequence of the declaration of nullity of said resolutions, petitioners have the right to reinstatement or to separation in lieu of reinstatement pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program plus backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits accruing from January 2003 to the date of their reinstatement or payment of separation pay; and (3) 10% charging lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio.All these notwithstanding, NPC raised two new issues in a desperate effort to circumvent, frustrate and delay the final and executory orders of the Court, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated on 31 January 2003; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the purported infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. NPC's raising these issues after the Court's decision and resolution have become final and executory is a clear case of afterthought and act of desperation. Petitioners claim that the NPC had all the time to raise said issues before the decision and resolution became final and executory, but it did not. Thus, it is guilty of estoppel. Petitioners added that the NPC in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration admitted that \"the nullification of National Power Board Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 have far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath. For one, it would entail a financial liability on the part of respondent in the amount of not less than FOUR BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY-THREE PESOS (P4,701,354,073.00), representing the backwages and wage adjustments of employees. (as of October 2006)\" This admission, petitioners contend, belies NPC's claim that only 16 were illegally terminated pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 considering that such amount cannot obviously cover only 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.Moreover, petitioners alleged that the NPC, through its numerous pleadings, made them and the Court believe that pursuant to the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. The issue that only 16 employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 was never raised before the Court's decision and resolution became final and executory. Now, after eight long years, NPC suddenly tells the Court that only 16 employees were terminated as of 31 January 2003. Such behavior shows lack of candor, honesty and fairness to the Court and to petitioners.Petitioners pray that: (1) all the respondents and their counsels be held in contempt of court and punished accordingly until or unless they immediately execute the decision/resolution of the Court; (2) to summon and/or direct Mr. Edmund P. Anguluan, the present Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration of NPC, to fully and strictly comply with paragraph 1 of the 10 December 2008 Resolution - the list should include all personnel who were terminated pursuant to or as a result of the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 regardless of their actual dates of termination; and (3) to appoint and authorize the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City to enforce by execution the Court's 10 December 2008 Resolution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM, based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the aforenamed Vice-President of NPC.The principal question to be resolved is: should the execution of our decision and resolution which have become final and executory on 10 October 2008 be stopped or be prevented because of the new issues raised by NPC? The two new issues are: (1) whether or not our decision affects only 16 employees or all the employees of NPC; and (2) whether or not NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 can be ratified by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55[27] which was issued on 14 September 2007.On the first issue, NPC contends it has complied with the directive of the Supreme Court to list all employees terminated/separated as a result of, or pursuant to, NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It stated that only its top-level employees, numbering sixteen (16), occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the aforesaid resolutions contrary to the position of petitioners that all employees of NPC were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003. NPC added that these 16 employees who were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003 were rehired after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA law. Thus, payment of any backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees are unnecessary and unwarranted.It is unquestionable that when we promulgated our decision on 26 September 2006 and our subsequent resolutions dated 24 January 2007, 17 September 2008 and 10 December 2008, we were referring to all employees of the NPC, not only the 16 top-level employees, as those whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003. This was based on the nullified NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 which reads in part:RESOLVED, FURTHER, That, pursuant to Section 63 of the EPIRA and Rule 33 of the IRR, all NPC personnel shall be legally terminated on January 31, 2003, and shall be entitled to the separation benefits as provided in the Guidelines hereunder adopted.[28]When the instant case was commenced with the filing of the petition, what was sought to be enjoined was the termination of all, not sixteen (16), NPC employees on 31 January 2003 in line with the restructuring of the NPC. All the while, the Court and the parties were on the same wavelength tackling the issue of whether the termination of all NPC employees pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, is valid. In fact, it is NPC's stand that pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. It is only after when our decision and resolution on the matter became final and executory did NPC reveal that not all, but only 16 top-level employees, were terminated on 31 January 2003.We find such action of NPC and its counsel improper. Why only now at this stage of the proceedings? NPC cannot possibly deny that the employees subject of the instant case involves all the personnel/employees of the NPC. As correctly pointed out by petitioners, NPC's statement in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration that the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 has far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath for it would entail a financial liability on its part in the amount of not less than P4,701,354,073.00 proves that what NPC is alluding to is the termination of all the employees of the NPC for the simple reason that said amount cannot be for the backwages, separation pay and other benefits of just 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.Under NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. However, because it was no longer tenable for NPC to complete the legal separation of NPC employees on 31 January 2003, NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003 was issued showing the effectivity of termination of personnel on 28 February 2003. NPC intentionally did not inform the Court that the separation of other employees holding the positions of below Vice-President levels, supervisors and rank-and-file was 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003. Furthermore, under NPC Circular No. 2003-09,[29] the dates of legal termination of all employees were as follows: (a) key officials - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; and (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. To further show that what is covered by the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 are all the NPC employees, petitioners attached a memorandum[30] from Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, HRM, NPC, to NPC President Froilan A. Tampinco explaining the amount of backwages, separation pay and other benefits to be received by the NPC terminated NPC employees.From all these, it is clear that our ruling, pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, covers all employees of the NPC and not only the 16 employees as contended by NPC. However, as regards their right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program, plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits, the same shall be computed from the date of legal termination as stated in NPC Circular No. 2003-09, to wit:a) The legal termination of key officials, i.e., the Corporate Secretary, Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who were appointed under NP Board Resolution No. 2003-12, shall be at the close of office hours of January 31, 2003.b) The legal termination of personnel who availed of the early leavers' scheme shall be on the last day of service in NPC but not beyond January 15, 2003.c) The legal termination of personnel who were no longer employed in NPC after June 26, 2001 shall be the date of actual separation in NPC.d) For all other NPC personnel, their legal termination shall be at the close of office hours/shift schedule of February 28, 2003.[31]but deducting therefrom the amount of separation benefits which they previously received under the null NPB Resolutions.On the second issue, NPC contends that when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55[32] dated 14 September 2007 was issued, the same ratified and confirmed NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. The purported infirmity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 was rectified and effectively mooted. In so doing, all the principles and guidelines enunciated in both resolutions have been adopted, confirmed and approved. In effect, what NPC is saying is that the decision/resolution can no longer be executed since it has corrected the infirmity or mistake that caused the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 by the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.As answer thereto, petitioners argue that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 cannot be ratified because only voidable acts can be ratified. Petitioners contend that both resolutions are void.Petitioners' contention that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void is correct. In our decision of 26 September 2006, the Court was very categorical in declaring that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are VOID and WITHOUT LEGAL EFFECT. The Court has ruled that said resolutions are void for violating Section 48 of the EPIRA Law which requires the persons enumerated therein to personally exercise their judgment and discretion. An illegal act is void and cannot be validated.[33] In the instant case, the approval of both resolutions was an illegal act for it violated the EPIRA Law.What then is the effect of the approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007? The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, supposedly by a majority of the National Power Board as designated by law, that adopted, confirmed and approved the contents of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 will have a prospective effect, not a retroactive effect. The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 cannot ratify and validate NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 as to make the termination of the services of all NPC personnel/employees on 31 January 2003 valid, because said resolutions were void.The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 means that the services of all NPC employees have been legally terminated on this date. All separation pay and other benefits to be received by said employees will be deemed cut on this date. The computation thereof shall, therefore, be from the date of their illegal termination pursuant to NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 as clarified by NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and NPC Resolution No. 2003-09 up to 14 September 2007. Although the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court, same has to be given effect because NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 enjoys the presumption of regularity of official acts. The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty.[34] Thus, until and unless there is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts this presumption, we have no option but to rule that said resolution is valid and effective as of 14 September 2007.We now resolve the issue of whether or not the assets of PSALM can be the subject of execution it being a non-party in this case.In their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners prayed that the decision/resolution of the court be enforced by execution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. In opposition thereto, PSALM stated that not being a party to the case, it is not bound by the decision rendered by the Court. It explained that there is nothing in the EPIRA Law that allows garnishment and/or levy of its assets to satisfy a judgment rendered against NPC. Not being employees of PSALM, the latter states that it cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. PSALM explains that when the EPIRA Law was passed on 26 June 2001, ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets were transferred to it by operation of law. All existing liabilities and outstanding financial obligations of NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instrument of indebtedness were legally transferred and assumed by PSALM. It stressed that the liability of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship is not one of those transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM. The EPIRA, it said, did not contemplate such kind of liability. Further, it claims that its assets and the privatization proceeds cannot be the subject of execution because these were already earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM.Sections 49 and 50 of the EPIRA Law read:SEC. 49. Creation of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. - There is hereby created a government-owned and -controlled corporation to be known as the \"Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation,\" hereinafter referred to as the \"PSALM Corp.,\" which shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. All outstanding obligations of the NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instruments of indebtedness shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp. within one hundred eighty (180) days from the approval of this Act.SEC. 50. Purpose and Objective, Domicile and Term of Existence. - The principal purpose of the PSALM Corp. is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.The PSALM Corp. shall have its principal office and place of business within Metro Manila.The PSALM Corp. shall exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years from the effectivity of this Act, unless otherwise provided by law, and all assets held by it, all moneys and properties belonging to it, and all its liabilities outstanding upon the expiration of its term of existence shall revert to and be assumed by the National Government.Under the EPIRA Law, PSALM shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. PSALM acquired ownership over said properties of NPC via the EPIRA Law. It did not deny such fact and even admitted the same.PSALM argues that the present judgment obligation of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship was neither an existing financial liability nor a contractual liability of NPC at the effectivity of the EPIRA Law. From a reading of said section 49, it appears that only existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets shall be transferred to PSALM. We, however, rule that the word \"existing\" is to be construed as to qualify only the term \"NPC generation assets.\" In arriving at said ruling, Section 49 must be read in conjunction with Section 50. The interpretation of the word \"existing\" should be understood in light of PSALM's purpose and objective during its term of existence (25 years from the effectivity of the law). It would be absurd to interpret the word \"existing\" as referring to the assets and liabilities of NPC only existing at the time when the EPIRA Law took effect (26 June 2001). It is more sensible and equitable that the word \"existing\" applies only to \"NPC generation assets\" because of the intent and purpose of the EPIRA Law which is to privatize NPC generation assets, real estate, and other disposable assets and IPP contracts. Upon the effectivity of the EPIRA Law, most of the assets of NPC, from which it got its income, was transferred to PSALM. When the privatization of NPC's assets is in progress, NPC may still incur liabilities, as what happened in the instant case. Who then shall answer for these liabilities? How can NPC answer for its liabilities if PSALM had already acquired almost all of its assets? It would be, under the circumstances, unfair and unjust if PSALM gets nearly all of NPC's assets but will not pay for liabilities incurred by NPC during this privatization stage. It must be remembered that the restructuring of the NPC was due to the EPIRA Law. It is also the EPIRA Law that authorized PSALM to take ownership of NPC's assets and liabilities. And since the restructuring of NPC, which this Court found to be void, was the cause of NPC's liability, it is but reasonable for PSALM to assume the liabilities of NPC during the privatization of the NPC's assets.It is well settled that courts are not to give a statute a meaning that would lead to absurdities. If the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one meaning, the absurdity of the result of one construction is a strong argument against its adoption, and in favor of such sensible interpretation. We test a law by its result. A law should not be interpreted so as not to cause an injustice. There are laws which are generally valid but may seem arbitrary when applied in a particular case because of its peculiar circumstances. We are not bound to apply them in slavish obedience to their language.[35] The court may consider the spirit and reason of the statute, where a literal meaning would lead to absurdity, contradiction, injustice, or would defeat the clear purpose of the lawmakers.[36] Taking into consideration the legislative intent and applying the rule of reason, we hold that the word \"existing\" should be interpreted to only qualify the term \"NPC generation assets\" and not the word \"liabilities.\"On PSALM's contention that since it was not a party to the case and that the petitioners are not its employees, the properties that it acquired from NPC cannot be levied, is untenable. The issue here is about PSALM's assets that were acquired from NPC. As explained above, PSALM took ownership over most of NPC's assets. There was indeed a transfer of interest over these assets - from NPC to PSALM - by operation of law. These properties may be used to satisfy our judgment. This being the case, petitioners may go after such properties. The fact that PSALM is a non-party to the case will not prevent the levying of the said properties, including their fruits and proceeds. However, PSALM should not be denied due process. The levying of said properties and their fruits/proceeds, if still needed in case NPC's properties are insufficient to satisfy our judgment, is without prejudice to PSALM's participation in said proceedings. Its participation therein is necessary to prevent the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC. Such a proceeding is to be conducted in the proper forum where petitioners may take the appropriate action.Section 19, Rule 3 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure reads:Sec. 19. Transfer of interest. - In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.Under this section, the Court may, upon motion, direct the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. In petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, they prayed that the properties acquired by PSALM from NPC be also levied/garnished. We consider this prayer to be tantamount to a motion to join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case in so far as to the properties, and any income arising therefrom, that PSALM acquired from NPC. It is in this light that we order the Clerk of Court of this division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case. As above-explained, PSALM shall not be denied due process for it can participate in the proper forum by preventing the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC.We now go to the implementation of our decision. Petitioners submitted to this Court a list[37] supposedly containing names of employees separated from the NPC pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 and the respective amounts they will receive. The computation of the benefits due them started on 1 February 2003/1 March 2003 to 30 June 2009. Even if we are to consider said list to be an official document released with authority by the NPC, we unfortunately cannot use the same to determine, at this point, the amounts due each of the affected NPC employees for the simple reason that amounts due should only be from the date of the employees' illegal termination (31 January 2003 for key officials; last day of service in NPC but not beyond 15 January 2003 for early leavers; date of actual separation for personnel no longer employed at the NPC after 26 June 2001; and 28 February 2003 for all other NPC personnel)[38] up to 14 September 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued. This list which should contain the names of all, not only 16, the affected NPC employees shall be submitted by the Chairperson and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to the proper person to execute this judgment within ten (10) days from receipt of this resolution.The instant petition for injunction was filed directly to this Court as mandated by Section 78[39] of the EPIRA Law. In as much as this Court does not have a sheriff of its own to execute our decision, we deem it appropriate, pursuant to Section 6,[40] Rule 135 of the Rules of Court and considering that the principal office of NPC is located in Quezon City, to authorize the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City to execute our judgment which became final and executory on 10 October 2008 and for which an entry of judgment was made on 27 October 2008. After receipt of the list containing the names of the affected NPC employees and benefits due each of them, the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City is directed to forthwith execute our judgment. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court resolves to GRANT petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 by:1. ORDERING the Chairperson and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation, and their respective counsels, to SHOW CAUSE why they should not be held in contempt of court for their willful failure to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution dated 10 December 2008 by claiming that the Court's decision nullifying NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 covered only sixteen employees when it is clear that the Court's decision covered all personnel/employees affected by the restructuring of the NPC;2. ORDERING the Clerk of Court of this Division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case;3. ORDERING the Chairperson and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation to comply with the Court's Resolution dated 10 December 2008. The list shall contain all the names of all, not 16, NPC personnel/employees affected by the restructuring of the NPC. The computation of the amounts due the employees who were terminated and/or separated as a result of, or pursuant to, the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 shall be from their date of illegal termination up to 14 September 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued. Said list shall be submitted to the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City within ten (10) days from receipt of this resolution. They are also ordered to submit to this Court their compliance to said order within thirty (30) days from receipt of this resolution; and4. DIRECTING the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City to cause the immediate execution of our Decision. Said Clerk of Court is further directed to submit to this Court his/her compliance to this directive within thirty (30) days from receipt of this resolution.SO ORDERED.Corona, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.*, Leonardo-De Castro, and Brion**, JJ., concur.* Associate Justice Teresita J.

REINOSO, JR., GREGORY L. DOMINGO AND NIEVES L. OSORIO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCHICO-NAZARIO, J.:\n\nUnder consideration are the following:\nPetitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Motion dated 9 February 2009;\nPower Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation's (PSALM's) Manifestation dated 24 February 2009;\nNational Power Corporation's (NPC's) Compliance dated 9 March 2009;\nPetitioners' Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009;\nPetitioners' Comment/Manifestation and Urgent Motion dated 23 March 2009;\nPSALM's Submission dated 20 April 2009;\nNPC's Consolidated Comment dated 26 May 2009; and\nPetitioners' Reply to NPC's Consolidated Comment dated 5 June 2009.\n\nIn Our decision dated 26 September 2006, we declared void and without legal effect National Power Board (NPB) Resolutions No. 2002-124 [1] and No. 2002-125, [2] both dated 18 November 2002, which directed, inter alia , the termination from the service of all employees of the National Power Corporation (NPC) on 31 January 2003 in line with the restructuring of the NPC, and thereafter enjoined the implementation of said resolutions by granting the petition for injunction. [3]\n\nThe dispositive portion of the decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, National Power Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are hereby declared VOID and WITHOUT LEGAL EFFECT. The Petition for Injunction is hereby GRANTED and respondents are hereby ENJOINED from implementing said NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. [4]\n\nIn a resolution dated 24 January 2007, for lack of merit, we denied with finality the motion for reconsideration of respondent NPC. [5]\n\nIn a resolution dated 17 September 2008, the Court resolved to:\n\n(1) PARTIALLY GRANT the Motion for Clarification and/or Amplification of petitioners by affirming that, as a logical and necessary consequence of our Decision dated 26 September 2006 declaring null and without effect NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 and enjoining the implementation of the same, petitioners have the right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program; plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits accruing from 31 January 2003 to the date of their reinstatement or payment of separation pay; but deducting therefrom the amount of separation benefits which they previously received under the null NPB Resolutions;\n\n(2) PARTIALLY GRANT the Motion for Approval of Charging (Attorney's) Lien of Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio and ORDER the entry in the records of this case of their ten percent (10%) charging lien on the amounts recoverable by petitioners from respondent NPC by virtue of our Decision dated 26 September 2006; and\n\n(3) ORDER that Entry of Judgment be finally made in due course in the case at bar. [6]\n\nIn a letter dated 29 September 2008, Attys. Victoriano V. Orocio (Orocio) and Cornelio P. Aldon (Aldon) requested that Entry of Judgment be made in the instant case and a resolution implementing the same be issued immediately. [7]\n\nOn 27 October 2008, an Entry of Judgment was made in the case stating, among other things, that the judgment herein has become final and executory on 10 October 2008 and has been recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgments. [8]\n\nOn 14 November 2008, petitioners filed an Urgent Motion for Execution. They ask that the motion be granted by:\n\n(1) Directing/Ordering the Office of the Clerk and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City as being the appropriate forum for the computation of the actual amounts due to the petitioners as well as the total amount of the charging lien of Atty. Cornelio P. Aldon and Atty. Victoriano V. Orocio, to determine and find out the names and number of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolution(s) No. 2002-124 and 2002-125, and the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory, including the totality of the said amounts for the purpose of determining the 10% charging lien of Attorneys Aldon and Orocio, by summoning and issuing proper subpoenas to the Vice-Pres., Human Resources and to the Senior Department Manager for Finance of the NPC and directing the said responsible NPC officials to make and submit such list and computations under oath;\n\n(2) Directing/Ordering the said Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City after and on the basis of the said list and computations submitted by said NPC officials, to issue the corresponding writ of execution; and\n\n(3) Directing said Office to undertake any and all actions necessary to implement and execute the decision and resolution in this case thru said writ of execution and, thereafter, to submit a report thereon to this Court. [9]\n\nFinding petitioners' Motion for Urgent Execution meritorious, we granted the same per resolution dated 10 December 2008, and issued the following order:\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the National Power Corporation (NPC) to cause the preparation of a list, under oath, of (a) the names of all NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated as a result of or pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, and (b) the amounts due to each of them by way of separation pay, backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits in accordance with applicable jurisprudence on illegal dismissal cases, as well as interests due from the time the decision became final and executory. From the totality of the amounts due to the illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, the same officers are directed to compute the 10% charging lien thereon of Atty. Cornelio P. Aldon (Aldon) and Atty. Victoriano V. Orocio (Orocio) pursuant to the Resolution dated 17 September 2008 of this Court;\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to pay or cause to be paid immediately the amounts due to the petitioners and all other illegally dismissed NPC personnel/employees, as well as the amount of charging lien to Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio, in accordance with the list and computations prepared under oath pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof; and\n\nThe Chairman and Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC to respectively submit proof of their compliance of the orders of this Court as stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution. [10]\n\nIn their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners asked the Court to: (1) cite the Chairman and the Members of the National Power Board and the President of the NPC in contempt for their willful failure to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution dated 10 December 2008 which is a mockery of the Court's Order and gross disrespect of its authority; (2) appoint the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, together with his/her deputies, to enforce by execution the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishing/levying upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the responsible NPC officials hereafter to be summoned; (3) immediately summon the concerned and responsible NPC officials, namely: Mr. Eduardo P. Elroy, Vice-President, Human Resources, Mr. Paquito F. Garcia, Sr., Department Manager, Human Resources & Administration and Ms. Wilma V. Ortega, Manager, Compensation and Benefits Management Division (CBMD), Human Resources Department, NPC, to attest jointly and severally under oath as to the existence of a 212-page list [11] containing the names of NPC personnel/employees terminated and/or separated from the service as a result of the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 with the amounts due to them and the charging lien due Attys. Orocio and Aldon, and to submit under oath jointly and severally the certified true copies thereof to the Court. [12]\n\nOn 11 February 2009, Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo, through counsel Casan B. Macabanding, filed a Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution. They informed the Court that demand letters have been sent to the National Power Board and to the NPC showing the computations of the amount due each of them. Despite this, no action has been taken thereon. They therefore ask that an order be issued directing the Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon and/or Sheriff of Lanao del Sur, 12 th Judicial Region, Marawi City, to seize and attach cash and properties of the NPC and to apply the same to their claim of P16,120,706.00, and to deduct therefrom the attorney's lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio. [13]\n\nOn 17 February 2009, the NPC asked for additional 30 days to address the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 [14] which petitioners opposed. [15]\n\nOn 25 February 2009, PSALM filed a Manifestation stating that petitioners did not furnish it a copy of their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 wherein they prayed that the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City be appointed to enforce the Court's Resolution dated 10 December 2008 by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. Not being a party in the case, PSALM said it is not bound by the judgment rendered by the Court. It added that PSALM is mandated to privatize the transferred NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and to apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of all existing and outstanding NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. Nothing in the EPIRA [16] allows garnishment and levy of PSALM's assets to satisfy a judgment against NPC. Petitioners are not employees of PSALM but of respondent NPC. PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees for it is not one of those liabilities transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM at the effectivity of the EPIRA. It explains that since the privatization proceeds are earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM, same are not within the reach of any execution and garnishment. The garnishment and/or levying of PSALM's assets and privatization proceeds will amount to diverting them for the purpose originally contemplated by the EPIRA. Such garnishment and/or levy will amount to a disbursement without proper appropriation as required by law. Finally, it argues that the present executory course of action taken by petitioners is a deviation from the Court's Resolution dated 17 September 2008 which leaves the computation of the actual amounts due them and the enforcement of payment thereof to the proper forum in appropriate proceedings for the Court is not a trier of facts. [17]\n\nIn its Compliance [18] dated 9 March 2009, NPC informed the Court that only the services of its top level employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 contrary to the submissions made by petitioner in its Manifestation and Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009. More specifically, it said only the services of sixteen (16) NPC employees occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager, were terminated on 31 January 2003, but were rehired on 1 February 2003 after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA. It explained that any additional payment of separation pay, backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees would be iniquitous and would constitute unjust enrichment as they were never unemployed.\n\nIt further stated that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 were nullified because they were signed by alternates. This infirmity, it explained, was rectified and effectively mooted with the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 [19] dated 14 September 2007 which adopted, confirmed and approved the principles and guidelines enunciated in NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It likewise pointed out that the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, petitioners filed a Counter-Manifestation [20] to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009 stating that a writ of execution may be issued against non-parties, including the PSALM, under, among others, the following situations: (1) one who is privy to the judgment debtor; (2) a successor-in-interest; and (3) under the principle of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. Petitioners explained that PSALM is privy to NPC because the former was principally organized to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and Independent Power Producers (IPP) contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. PSALM, also being a successor-in-interest of NPC, is now the owner of the financial obligations/liabilities of NPC and shall be considered as one with NPC and the liability of the latter shall attach to the former. Further, it said PSALM is a mere alter ego or business conduit of NPC as evidenced by the fact that majority of the members of the NPB also constitutes the majority of the PSALM Board and that the NPB and the PSALM Board have held joint board meetings to resist payment in relation to the 10 December 2008 Resolution. Petitioners disclosed that the NPB and the PSALM Board recently issued a joint letter-instruction to the power consumers of NPC that all payments for power sales shall be directly remitted to PSALM. They further claimed that this letter-instruction violates the EPIRA Law because the payment for power sales to NPC is not enumerated among the funds, assets, contribution and other properties that constitute the property of PSALM, and that these payments constitute gross income revenue and not net profits of NPC. As a garnishee, PSALM need not be summoned or impleaded as a party to the case.\n\nOn 24 March 2009, petitioners filed their Comment/Manifestation and Urgent Motions (1) To include for Contempt Respondents' Counsels and (2) To Summon the Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration, NPC to Attest and Certify Certain Official Documents. [21] Petitioners point out that respondents, in their compliance, raise two new issues, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125.\n\nOn the first issue, petitioners explain that respondents' misrepresentation that there were only 16 NPC personnel whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003 is true but is only half-true. They have intentionally suppressed and conveniently omitted in their Compliance to mention and inform the Court of the fact that while under NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003, for various reasons, their actual termination was effected on different dates, as follows: (a) top executives - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. In support thereof, they mentioned NPB Resolution No. 2003-11, NPC Circular No. 2003-09 and the Memorandum dated 26 February 2009 of Dr. Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration (HRA), NPC. They revealed that NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 is one of the resolutions ratified and confirmed by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.\n\nAs to the second issue, petitioners argue that since NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect, the same cannot be rectified and ratified since only voidable acts can be validated.\n\nIn our Resolution dated 15 April 2009, the Court, among other things, required NPC to file its Comment on Petitioner's Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. The Court deferred action on petitioners' motion for implementation of the issued writ of execution dated 10 February 2009 pending filing by NPC of the afore-said comments. [22]\n\nOn 5 May 2009, PSALM filed a Submission to petitioners' Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009. [23] It argued that a writ of execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court. It said it is neither a successor-in-interest nor an alter-ego or business conduit of NPC. Being employees of NPC, PSALM cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. It claims that petitioners' claim on the supposed conduct of joint board meetings of NPC and PSALM Boards is purely conjectural and without factual basis. The sending of letters to distribution utilities, like MERALCO, is a consequence of the implementation of the EPIRA as to the ownership by PSALM of all NPC generation assets, IPP Contracts, etc . On the claim that payment for power sales by customers are not one of those under the EPIRA as constituting properties of PSALM and that they constitute gross income and not net profits of NPC, PSALM argues that same is absurd because as owner of the generation assets, it is entitled to the income derived from the sale of electricity. Said income partakes of the nature of fruits which belong to the owner of the asset. Finally, it argued that not being a party in the case or judgment debtor, its properties cannot be garnished.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, petitioners Ora Limpao, Abdullah Ali, Moctar D. Amundia, Macawali D. Minalang, Aliola Cawi, Talib Manudi and Masiding Tanggo filed a Manifestation and Motion reiterating their prayer in their Motion for Implementation of the Issued Writ of Execution motion dated 11 February 2009. [24]\n\nOn 28 May 2009, respondent NPC filed its Consolidated Comment [25] on Petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009 and Comment/Manifestation and urgent motions dated 23 March 2009, and on PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009.\n\nOn PSALM's Manifestation, NPC agreed with PSALM that execution of its properties is improper as it is not a party in the case.\n\nOn petitioners' Manifestation and Comment, NPC contends that petitioners are either confused or deviously sneaking into the present controversy facts, issues and reliefs that have not been litigated or resolved in the instant case. It argues that it involves the nullification of NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 did not affect the reorganization of the NPC because other resolutions pursuant thereto remain valid. The Court even declared in its 17 September 2008 Resolution that the \" NPC can still pursue its reorganization although it cannot implement the same by terminating petitioners' employment on 31 January 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and 2002-125. \" Under Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, only the services of 16 top level employees were terminated. As admitted by petitioners, the services of other NPC employees were terminated on 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11. The validity of this latter resolution has not been the subject of the present controversy.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, petitioners filed their Reply to NPC's Consolidated Comment. [26] Petitioners reiterated their Counter-Manifestation dated 13 March 2009 to PSALM's Manifestation dated 24 February 2009. In addition, they explained that the purpose of the EPIRA in creating PSALM is to sell and dispose the assets of NPC and to use the proceeds therefrom to liquidate all the financial obligations and liabilities of the NPC. It quoted Congressman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella's opinion which was in response to a legal opinion of Cyril C. del Callar, former NPC President, as to the function of PSALM. The opinion partly reads: The function of PSALM is limited and akin to that of a liquidator of NPC assets as stated in Section 50 of the EPIRA that the principal purpose of PSALM is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the end in view of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.\n\nPetitioners insists it is the NPC and its counsel (Office of the Solicitor General), not them, that are guilty of raising new issues without valid and legal justification. They explained that the Court had settled the following issues: (1) NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are null and without legal effect; (2) as a consequence of the declaration of nullity of said resolutions, petitioners have the right to reinstatement or to separation in lieu of reinstatement pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program plus backwages, wage adjustments and other benefits accruing from January 2003 to the date of their reinstatement or payment of separation pay; and (3) 10% charging lien of Attys. Aldon and Orocio.\n\nAll these notwithstanding, NPC raised two new issues in a desperate effort to circumvent, frustrate and delay the final and executory orders of the Court, to wit: (1) there are only 16 NPC personnel (top executives) who were illegally terminated on 31 January 2003; and (2) the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 effectively rectified and mooted the purported infirmity of the nullified NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. NPC's raising these issues after the Court's decision and resolution have become final and executory is a clear case of afterthought and act of desperation. Petitioners claim that the NPC had all the time to raise said issues before the decision and resolution became final and executory, but it did not. Thus, it is guilty of estoppel. Petitioners added that the NPC in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration admitted that \"the nullification of National Power Board Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 have far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath. For one, it would entail a financial liability on the part of respondent in the amount of not less than FOUR BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY-THREE PESOS (P4,701,354,073.00), representing the backwages and wage adjustments of employees. (as of October 2006)\" This admission, petitioners contend, belies NPC's claim that only 16 were illegally terminated pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 considering that such amount cannot obviously cover only 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.\n\nMoreover, petitioners alleged that the NPC, through its numerous pleadings, made them and the Court believe that pursuant to the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. The issue that only 16 employees were terminated on 31 January 2003 was never raised before the Court's decision and resolution became final and executory. Now, after eight long years, NPC suddenly tells the Court that only 16 employees were terminated as of 31 January 2003. Such behavior shows lack of candor, honesty and fairness to the Court and to petitioners.\n\nPetitioners pray that: (1) all the respondents and their counsels be held in contempt of court and punished accordingly until or unless they immediately execute the decision/resolution of the Court; (2) to summon and/or direct Mr. Edmund P. Anguluan, the present Vice-President, Human Resources and Administration of NPC, to fully and strictly comply with paragraph 1 of the 10 December 2008 Resolution - the list should include all personnel who were terminated pursuant to or as a result of the null NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 regardless of their actual dates of termination; and (3) to appoint and authorize the Clerk of Court and Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC of Quezon City to enforce by execution the Court's 10 December 2008 Resolution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM, based on the list and computations submitted and attested to by the aforenamed Vice-President of NPC.\n\nThe principal question to be resolved is: should the execution of our decision and resolution which have become final and executory on 10 October 2008 be stopped or be prevented because of the new issues raised by NPC? The two new issues are: (1) whether or not our decision affects only 16 employees or all the employees of NPC; and (2) whether or not NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 can be ratified by NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 [27] which was issued on 14 September 2007.\n\nOn the first issue, NPC contends it has complied with the directive of the Supreme Court to list all employees terminated/separated as a result of, or pursuant to, NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. It stated that only its top-level employees, numbering sixteen (16), occupying the positions of Senior Vice-President, Vice-President and Department Manager were terminated on 31 January 2003 pursuant to the aforesaid resolutions contrary to the position of petitioners that all employees of NPC were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003. NPC added that these 16 employees who were terminated/separated on 31 January 2003 were rehired after receiving a full separation package pursuant to the EPIRA law. Thus, payment of any backwages and other benefits to these 16 employees are unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nIt is unquestionable that when we promulgated our decision on 26 September 2006 and our subsequent resolutions dated 24 January 2007, 17 September 2008 and 10 December 2008, we were referring to all employees of the NPC, not only the 16 top-level employees, as those whose services were terminated on 31 January 2003. This was based on the nullified NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 which reads in part:\n\nRESOLVED, FURTHER, That, pursuant to Section 63 of the EPIRA and Rule 33 of the IRR, all NPC personnel shall be legally terminated on January 31, 2003 , and shall be entitled to the separation benefits as provided in the Guidelines hereunder adopted. [28]\nWhen the instant case was commenced with the filing of the petition, what was sought to be enjoined was the termination of all, not sixteen (16), NPC employees on 31 January 2003 in line with the restructuring of the NPC. All the while, the Court and the parties were on the same wavelength tackling the issue of whether the termination of all NPC employees pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, is valid. In fact, it is NPC's stand that pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, all NPC personnel were legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. It is only after when our decision and resolution on the matter became final and executory did NPC reveal that not all, but only 16 top-level employees, were terminated on 31 January 2003.\n\nWe find such action of NPC and its counsel improper. Why only now at this stage of the proceedings? NPC cannot possibly deny that the employees subject of the instant case involves all the personnel/employees of the NPC. As correctly pointed out by petitioners, NPC's statement in its Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration that the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 has far reaching implications and dreadful aftermath for it would entail a financial liability on its part in the amount of not less than P4,701,354,073.00 proves that what NPC is alluding to is the termination of all the employees of the NPC for the simple reason that said amount cannot be for the backwages, separation pay and other benefits of just 16 employees but thousands of NPC personnel.\n\nUnder NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, the services of all NPC personnel/employees were deemed legally terminated as of 31 January 2003. However, because it was no longer tenable for NPC to complete the legal separation of NPC employees on 31 January 2003, NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003 was issued showing the effectivity of termination of personnel on 28 February 2003. NPC intentionally did not inform the Court that the separation of other employees holding the positions of below Vice-President levels, supervisors and rank-and-file was 28 February 2003 pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 dated 22 January 2003. Furthermore, under NPC Circular No. 2003-09, [29] the dates of legal termination of all employees were as follows: (a) key officials - 31 January 2003; (b) early-leavers - 15 January 2003; (c) those no longer employed in NPC after 26 June 2001 - date of actual separation; and (d) all other personnel - 28 February 2003. To further show that what is covered by the Court's resolution dated 10 December 2008 are all the NPC employees, petitioners attached a memorandum [30] from Eduardo R. Eroy, Vice-President, HRM, NPC, to NPC President Froilan A. Tampinco explaining the amount of backwages, separation pay and other benefits to be received by the NPC terminated NPC employees.\n\nFrom all these, it is clear that our ruling, pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, covers all employees of the NPC and not only the 16 employees as contended by NPC. However, as regards their right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program, plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits, the same shall be computed from the date of legal termination as stated in NPC Circular No. 2003-09, to wit:\n\na) The legal termination of key officials , i.e. , the Corporate Secretary, Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who were appointed under NP Board Resolution No. 2003-12, shall be at the close of office hours of January 31, 2003 .\n\nb) The legal termination of personnel who availed of the early leavers' scheme shall be on the last day of service in NPC but not beyond January 15, 2003 .\n\nc) The legal termination of personnel who were no longer employed in NPC after June 26, 2001 shall be the date of actual separation in NPC.\n\nd) For all other NPC personnel , their legal termination shall be at the close of office hours/shift schedule of February 28, 2003 . [31]\nbut deducting therefrom the amount of separation benefits which they previously received under the null NPB Resolutions.\n\nOn the second issue, NPC contends that when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 [32] dated 14 September 2007 was issued, the same ratified and confirmed NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125. The purported infirmity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 was rectified and effectively mooted. In so doing, all the principles and guidelines enunciated in both resolutions have been adopted, confirmed and approved. In effect, what NPC is saying is that the decision/resolution can no longer be executed since it has corrected the infirmity or mistake that caused the nullification of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 by the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55.\n\nAs answer thereto, petitioners argue that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 cannot be ratified because only voidable acts can be ratified. Petitioners contend that both resolutions are void.\n\nPetitioners' contention that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void is correct. In our decision of 26 September 2006, the Court was very categorical in declaring that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are VOID and WITHOUT LEGAL EFFECT. The Court has ruled that said resolutions are void for violating Section 48 of the EPIRA Law which requires the persons enumerated therein to personally exercise their judgment and discretion. An illegal act is void and cannot be validated. [33] In the instant case, the approval of both resolutions was an illegal act for it violated the EPIRA Law.\n\nWhat then is the effect of the approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007? The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, supposedly by a majority of the National Power Board as designated by law, that adopted, confirmed and approved the contents of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 will have a prospective effect , not a retroactive effect. The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 cannot ratify and validate NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 as to make the termination of the services of all NPC personnel/employees on 31 January 2003 valid, because said resolutions were void.\n\nThe approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 means that the services of all NPC employees have been legally terminated on this date. All separation pay and other benefits to be received by said employees will be deemed cut on this date. The computation thereof shall, therefore, be from the date of their illegal termination pursuant to NPB Resolutions Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 as clarified by NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and NPC Resolution No. 2003-09 up to 14 September 2007. Although the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court, same has to be given effect because NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 enjoys the presumption of regularity of official acts. The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty. [34] Thus, until and unless there is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts this presumption, we have no option but to rule that said resolution is valid and effective as of 14 September 2007.\n\nWe now resolve the issue of whether or not the assets of PSALM can be the subject of execution it being a non-party in this case.\n\nIn their Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, petitioners prayed that the decision/resolution of the court be enforced by execution by garnishment/levy upon the assets of NPC, including but not limited to the assets of PSALM. In opposition thereto, PSALM stated that not being a party to the case, it is not bound by the decision rendered by the Court. It explained that there is nothing in the EPIRA Law that allows garnishment and/or levy of its assets to satisfy a judgment rendered against NPC. Not being employees of PSALM, the latter states that it cannot be made liable for the financial obligations of NPC to its employees. PSALM explains that when the EPIRA Law was passed on 26 June 2001, ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets were transferred to it by operation of law. All existing liabilities and outstanding financial obligations of NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instrument of indebtedness were legally transferred and assumed by PSALM. It stressed that the liability of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship is not one of those transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM. The EPIRA, it said, did not contemplate such kind of liability. Further, it claims that its assets and the privatization proceeds cannot be the subject of execution because these were already earmarked specifically for the liquidation of NPC's financial obligations transferred to, and assumed by, PSALM.\n\nSections 49 and 50 of the EPIRA Law read:\n\nSEC. 49. Creation of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. - There is hereby created a government-owned and -controlled corporation to be known as the \"Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation,\" hereinafter referred to as the \"PSALM Corp.,\" which shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. All outstanding obligations of the NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instruments of indebtedness shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp. within one hundred eighty (180) days from the approval of this Act.\n\nSEC. 50. Purpose and Objective, Domicile and Term of Existence. - The principal purpose of the PSALM Corp. is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.\n\nThe PSALM Corp. shall have its principal office and place of business within Metro Manila.\n\nThe PSALM Corp. shall exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years from the effectivity of this Act, unless otherwise provided by law, and all assets held by it, all moneys and properties belonging to it, and all its liabilities outstanding upon the expiration of its term of existence shall revert to and be assumed by the National Government.\nUnder the EPIRA Law, PSALM shall take ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. PSALM acquired ownership over said properties of NPC via the EPIRA Law. It did not deny such fact and even admitted the same.\n\nPSALM argues that the present judgment obligation of NPC arising from employer-employee relationship was neither an existing financial liability nor a contractual liability of NPC at the effectivity of the EPIRA Law. From a reading of said section 49, it appears that only existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets shall be transferred to PSALM. We, however, rule that the word \"existing\" is to be construed as to qualify only the term \"NPC generation assets.\" In arriving at said ruling, Section 49 must be read in conjunction with Section 50. The interpretation of the word \"existing\" should be understood in light of PSALM's purpose and objective during its term of existence (25 years from the effectivity of the law). It would be absurd to interpret the word \"existing\" as referring to the assets and liabilities of NPC only existing at the time when the EPIRA Law took effect (26 June 2001). It is more sensible and equitable that the word \"existing\" applies only to \"NPC generation assets\" because of the intent and purpose of the EPIRA Law which is to privatize NPC generation assets, real estate, and other disposable assets and IPP contracts. Upon the effectivity of the EPIRA Law, most of the assets of NPC, from which it got its income, was transferred to PSALM. When the privatization of NPC's assets is in progress, NPC may still incur liabilities, as what happened in the instant case. Who then shall answer for these liabilities? How can NPC answer for its liabilities if PSALM had already acquired almost all of its assets? It would be, under the circumstances, unfair and unjust if PSALM gets nearly all of NPC's assets but will not pay for liabilities incurred by NPC during this privatization stage. It must be remembered that the restructuring of the NPC was due to the EPIRA Law. It is also the EPIRA Law that authorized PSALM to take ownership of NPC's assets and liabilities. And since the restructuring of NPC, which this Court found to be void, was the cause of NPC's liability, it is but reasonable for PSALM to assume the liabilities of NPC during the privatization of the NPC's assets.\n\nIt is well settled that courts are not to give a statute a meaning that would lead to absurdities. If the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one meaning, the absurdity of the result of one construction is a strong argument against its adoption, and in favor of such sensible interpretation. We test a law by its result. A law should not be interpreted so as not to cause an injustice. There are laws which are generally valid but may seem arbitrary when applied in a particular case because of its peculiar circumstances. We are not bound to apply them in slavish obedience to their language. [35] The court may consider the spirit and reason of the statute, where a literal meaning would lead to absurdity, contradiction, injustice, or would defeat the clear purpose of the lawmakers. [36] Taking into consideration the legislative intent and applying the rule of reason, we hold that the word \"existing\" should be interpreted to only qualify the term \"NPC generation assets\" and not the word \"liabilities.\"\n\nOn PSALM's contention that since it was not a party to the case and that the petitioners are not its employees, the properties that it acquired from NPC cannot be levied, is untenable. The issue here is about PSALM's assets that were acquired from NPC. As explained above, PSALM took ownership over most of NPC's assets. There was indeed a transfer of interest over these assets - from NPC to PSALM - by operation of law. These properties may be used to satisfy our judgment. This being the case, petitioners may go after such properties. The fact that PSALM is a non-party to the case will not prevent the levying of the said properties, including their fruits and proceeds. However, PSALM should not be denied due process. The levying of said properties and their fruits/proceeds, if still needed in case NPC's properties are insufficient to satisfy our judgment, is without prejudice to PSALM's participation in said proceedings. Its participation therein is necessary to prevent the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC. Such a proceeding is to be conducted in the proper forum where petitioners may take the appropriate action.\n\nSection 19, Rule 3 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure reads:\n\nSec. 19. Transfer of interest . - In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.\n\nUnder this section, the Court may, upon motion, direct the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. In petitioners' Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, they prayed that the properties acquired by PSALM from NPC be also levied/garnished. We consider this prayer to be tantamount to a motion to join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case in so far as to the properties, and any income arising therefrom, that PSALM acquired from NPC. It is in this light that we order the Clerk of Court of this division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case. As above-explained, PSALM shall not be denied due process for it can participate in the proper forum by preventing the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC.\n\nWe now go to the implementation of our decision. Petitioners submitted to this Court a list [37] supposedly containing names of employees separated from the NPC pursuant to the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 and the respective amounts they will receive. The computation of the benefits due them started on 1 February 2003/1 March 2003 to 30 June 2009. Even if we are to consider said list to be an official document released with authority by the NPC, we unfortunately cannot use the same to determine, at this point, the amounts due each of the affected NPC employees for the simple reason that amounts due should only be from the date of the employees' illegal termination (31 January 2003 for key officials; last day of service in NPC but not beyond 15 January 2003 for early leavers; date of actual separation for personnel no longer employed at the NPC after 26 June 2001; and 28 February 2003 for all other NPC personnel) [38] up to 14 September 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued.

No. P-96-1182, July 19, 2000 ]\n\nJOSEFINA MARQUEZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. AIDA CLORES-RAMOS, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N\nJOSEFINA MARQUEZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. AIDA CLORES-RAMOS, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nKAPUNAN, J.:\n\nIn a sworn letter complaint dated October 10, 1995, Mrs. Josefina A. Marquez charged respondent, Ms. Aida Clores-Ramos, Court Stenographer III, OCC-RTC, Branch 29, Libmanan, Camarines Sur with unethical, illicit and highly immoral acts.\n\nComplainant alleged, among others, that she is the legal wife of Mr. Florencio Marquez, Sr.; that they were married on January 5, 1955 before the Roman Catholic Church of Libmanan; and that respondent is maintaining an amorous illicit relationship with her husband, out of which a baby boy was born on December 8, 1993 and baptized as Florencio Marquez, Jr. on February 11, 1994 at the St. James the Apostle Parish, Libmanan, Camarines Sur.\n\nAttached to her complaint are handwritten letters of her husband to respondent to prove her husband's extra-marital affairs with respondent Court Stenographer.\n\nMeanwhile, on October 30, 1995, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCAD) also received from the Department of Justice a First Indorsement, dated October 19, 1995 referring the same complaint dated September 8, 1995 for appropriate action. [1]\n\nLikewise, the Office of the Ombudsman sent its First Indorsement to the OCAD Complaint No. 95-2434 dated October 30, 1995 entitled \"Concerned Career Government Employee v. Aida Clores-Ramos\" complaining about the unethical actuations and lifestyle of the subject Court Stenographer for carrying an extra-marital relationship with a married man. [2]\n\nIn answer, respondent Aida C. Ramos alleged that she is an employee of the RTC, Branch 29, Libmanan, Camarines Sur as Court Stenographer III, having been employed since June 16, 1983. She, however, vehemently denied the allegations contained in the letter-complaint of Mrs. Josefina Marquez that she carried an illicit and immoral relationship with Mr. Florencio Marquez and narrated the following:\n\nx x x.\n\n2.a that since respondent's employment with the Court in 1983, she had never been a subject of any Administrative Complaint as her professional conduct as a public servant and in her private life and her community had been beyond reproach;\n\n2.b that respondent's fate was not kind to her. She was a victim of deception and betrayal twice over. In 1988, her husband, Raul D. Ramos, a womanizer, abandoned her and her son Ronan C. Ramos for other women and she was left alone to fend for her son and ailing mother;\n\n2.c That as fate would had its way, sometime on February, 1993 respondent cross paths with an old \"gentleman\" by the name of Florencio Marquez. She came to know him as a Balikbayan and a long time resident of the United States of America;\n\n2.d That Mr. Florencio Marquez like a wolf in a sheepskin's clothing, introduced himself as a \"widower\" since 1954. Then, he began courting her. He was a persistent suitor and promised marriage in the United States;\n\n2.e That Mr. Florencio Marquez to \"prove\" his representations as to his civil status, even gave respondent copies of certifications from the Local Civil Registrar of Libmanan, Camarines Sur regarding his previous marriage with Prudencia Frondozo and the fact of her death on January 9, 1954, which are appended hereto as Annexes \"A\" and \"B\", respectively, to form part hereof;\n\n2.f That respondent's only fault was that because of her rural upbringing and of her being na\u00efve in the ways of the world, she came to trust him and started to believe in Mr. Marquez's \"sincerity\" and \"good intentions\". So that on March, 1993, because of his persistence, respondent was prevailed upon to accept an invitation to have dinner with him. That acceptance started her travails leading to her present desolate situation;\n\n2.g That Mr. Florencio Marquez made respondent drink wine and not accustomed to it, she felt dizzy and fall asleep, only found out in the following morning that he had carnal knowledge of her. Outrage and self pity overcome respondent but the \"gentleman\" assuaged her emotional outpourings with his \"assurances\" and offer marriage in the United States of America;\n\n2.h That from thereon, the liasons became frequent and the promise of being brought to the United States and marriage in that country seemed endless;\n\n2.i That eventually, respondent got pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy on December 8, 1993 and was christened Florencio Marquez, Jr. The \"widower\" from looks of it was vent on migrating back to the United States with respondent and her son and was told to prepare her travelling papers with dispatch;\n\n2.j That it was at this point that respondent discovered the deception made on her by this \"widower\" gentleman. He was not after all a \"widower\" as he is very much a married man.\n\n2.k That respondent upon her discovery of Mr. Marquez's true Civil Status immediately severed her relationship with him and has no intention whatsoever in resuming the same now or in the near future. [3] In the Resolution of February 14, 1996, the case was referred to Executive Judge Salvador G. Cajot, RTC of Libmanan, Camarines Sur for Investigation/Report and Recommendation. [4]\n\nMeanwhile, the OCAD received a letter from complainant addressed to then Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa, withdrawing her complaint against respondent, stating that after conducting her own personal discreet investigation she discovered that the information given to her about the morality of Ms. Aida Clores-Ramos is not true, particularly the information that linked Florencio Marquez as her lover. She added \"that all the information given to [her] by the persons who pretended to help [her] were in fact and in truth have ulterior motives in destroying the honor, dignity and even the future of innocent persons, including Mr. Marquez.\" [5]\n\nBefore acting on the letter, the Court required the respondent to comment thereon. In response, complainant submitted to the Court a manifestation denying that she was the author of said letter of withdrawal. On the contrary, she stated that she was, in fact, very much interested and eager to pursue her case against respondent. She asked, however, that the Executive Judge of the RTC, Libmanan, Camarines Sur to whom this case was assigned for investigation should inhibit himself from conducting the investigation because said judge is a good friend of her husband. [6]\n\nThe case was then referred to Judge Lore V. Bagalacsa, RTC, Branch 56 of Libmanan, Camarines Sur for Investigation, Report and Recommendation.\n\nAccordingly, on June 22, 1998, Judge Lore Valencia-Bagalacsa submitted her Report and Recommendation finding respondent guilty of the charges against her and recommended her suspension for a period of one (1) year.\n\nThe evidence for complainant as described in Judge Valencia-Bagalacsa's report is as follows:\nJosefina Asuncion Demagante, a young widow of twenty-three married twenty-six year old widower Florencio Marquez in religious rites on January 5, 1955 at Libmanan, Camarines Sur (Exhibit A, p. 119, Vol. 2, Record). In their later years both went to the United States, but Marquez went home to the Philippines ahead of his wife as a `balikbayan.' He met one Aida Clores-Ramos, a court stenographer assigned at Branch 29 of Regional Trial Court in this jurisdiction. (see Complaint, pp. 6-7, Vol. 1, Record) Marquez and Ramos lived together in the years 1993 and 1994 and the latter gave birth to a son, who was born on December 8, 1993 and was baptized as Florencio Marquez, Jr., on February 11, 1994 (Exhibit B, p. 20, Vol. 1 and p. 120, Vol. 2, Record). While in the United States, Josefina Marquez learned of her husband's amorous relation with another woman, so she confronted him with it. Her husband wrote on September 7, 1993 (Exhibit C, p. 11, Vol. I, Record) and admitted the relation. He even named the woman as \"Aida Ramos, from Garchitorena\" (Exhibit C-1). He promised his wife that if she returns to the Philippines, she is still the `number one' so she should just relax. Aida, according to Mr. Marquez in his letter to his wife, is only his `alingan' (sexual playmate) while his wife is not here in Libmanan (Exhibit C-2). However, Josefina Marquez received more information from the Philippines about her husband's illicit relation with another woman. Feeling aggrieved, complainant went home to the Philippines, in September 1994.\n\nOne day, while cleaning their closets at their Libmanan residence, she found letters from her husband to respondent, and from the latter to her husband. There were also letters with envelopes addressed to Mrs. Aida Ramos of RTC Libmanan, Camarines Sur from one Florencio Marquez. One, dated March 7, 1994 (Exhibit G, p. 10, Vol. 1 and p. 127, Vol. 2, Record) relates his flight to the U.S. which took only 12 hours. The letter likewise informed \"Ma\" that he already talked with his wife about their situation in Libmanan and that the matter is settled already, and that they have no more problem. He also sent his regards especially to his boy `Florence' (Exhibit D-2) In another letter (Exhibit D-2), \"Papa\" writes \"Mama\" that he received her letter and knew what she meant; he related that he was operated on last March 31, 1994, and but there is no need to worry as he is now fine. He informed `Mama' that he will be home on April 28, 1994. The letter is addressed to Mrs. Aida Ramos of RTC Branch 29, Libmanan, Camarines Sur, from Florencio S. Marquez of Northridge, California, as shown in the postmarked envelope (Exhibit D, p. 12, Vol. 1, p. 124, Vol. 2, Record). Complainant found another letter from \"Mama\" dated February 9, 1993 to \"Papa\" advising the latter to inform one Eva frankly that he met somebody already, that it was Belen Naval who introduced her to him, so that her Tiya Linda will not be implicated. She cautioned in her letter never to mention her name and that he can talk to her but it will be for the last time. She assured him of her trust. (Exhibit F, pp. 18 and 19, Vol. 1, and p. 126, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nJosefina Marquez claimed that the \"Mama\" or \"Ma\" in the letters refer to respondent, as her husband calls her \"Mie\" as shown in the letter dated September 7, 1993. (p. 99, Sworn Statement of Josefina Marquez, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nOn December 8, 1996, Josefina was able to verify that on that day was the birthday of Florencio Marquez' son with the respondent. She thought it wise to visit the church in Libmanan, with the expectation to see the respondent there and to be able to talk to her personally. She asked someone in the church if she knows Aida Ramos, and the woman pointed out to her a woman carrying a child. Josefina approached the woman and inquired if she was Aida Ramos, and the latter answered in the affirmative. She asked her again if the child she was carrying was the son of Florencio Marquez, and she also replied in the affirmative. She then took photographs of mother and son (Exhibits E to E-2, inclusive, p. 14, Vol. 1, and p. 125, Vol. 2, Record). Then, she invited respondent outside the church to have a talk with her. There was an exchange of words with respondent. The latter replied: \"baco man lang aco an puta, cadacol diyan\" (I am not the only whore, there are a lot of them). (p. 99, Vol. 2 Record, Supra)\n\nArlyn Marquez, the 38 year old daughter of the complainant said that she found out about the much-talked about affair through her own investigation. She often saw her father at the Regional Trial Court picking up the respondent from work. At one time, she was looking for her father and found him at respondent's residence. The affair is known to the whole of Libmanan. When the son was baptized, there were balloons with the inscription: Florence 1st Birthday from Papa and Mama.\" There was a big birthday party and almost all of the court personnel were present. Complainant's daughter also recalled the sweet moments of her father and the respondent whenever the latter was in the Marquez' residence. Respondent used to go to the family house and bet on card games with other court employees.\n\nOne time, her father flagged her down and instructed her to bring Aida, who had a gasul tank, to the latter's house, but she refused. At another time, she saw her father being fed by Aida Ramos at a fiesta in Candato, in the house of one Antonia Relucio. These incidents are all etched in the memory of Arlyn as she was very hurt, knowing that her mother is still alive but her father is maintaining another family already. To her, respondent's affair with a married man surely affects the judiciary's integrity, as the former is a court stenographer. Her father, Arlyn related, is not moved by what the people are saying about them. Arlyn claims that the two are still seen together, be it in the market or in church, hearing mass together. (Exhibit I, pp. 101-102, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nNida Macarilay an active member of the Catholic Women's League (CWL), declared that she always sees Florencio Marquez and Aida Ramos in church whenever she is assigned to collect the offerings. The two were seen riding a motorcycle together in going to church and back to Aida's house. She was able to witness the baptism on February 11, 1994 of Florencio Marquez, Jr. as she was in church that time. She also knows that Ramos and Marquez lived together in 1993 and 1994. (Exhibit J, pp. 95-96, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nEdissa Velasco and Jesusa Avila, granddaughter and great granddaughter of Florencio Marquez narrated that they personally know Aida C. Ramos, as she is the paramour of their grandfather Florencio Marquez. When their grandmother was still in the USA, they saw Marquez cuddling Aida in the latter's house while Aida was caressing him. They came to know that Aida gave birth to the child of Florencio Marquez in December 1993 and in February the son was baptized. It was the talk of the town as the love affair of the two is well known in Libmanan. On November 25, 1996, in the afternoon, they saw Florencio Marquez together with Aida Ramos and their son in Naga City, they even kissed the hand of their grandfather as a sign of respect. Then, they went on their way to MacDonald's where they saw the three again. Both affirmed that their grandfather and respondent are still maintaining their relationship. In January 1997, they saw both hearing mass together. (p. 132, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nThe house of Aida Ramos in Taban, Libmanan, Camarines Sur is only a few meters away from the barangay hall, according to Salvador Flores, Punong Barangay of Taban, Libmanan, Camarines Sur, in his certification. Mr. Marquez, according to the Barangay Captain is a regular in-house visitor in respondent's house particularly during Friday evenings, and his visit is 'within public view.' (p. 141, Vol. 2, Record).\n\nMarquez established a shoe store at the Poblacion of Libmanan, Camarines Sur, and the same is jointly managed by respondent and Mr. Marquez. A photograph of the store was taken, and the respondent (X) is shown with her body half-hidden from the camera. (p. 142, Vol. 2, Record) Evidence reveals likewise that respondent and Mr. Marquez are regularly seen riding on a motorcycle together in public displaying their amorous relations. In one photograph, Mr. Marquez, respondent and the child are seen riding a motorcycle in public. (p. 143, Vol. 2, Record) Coleen Ori\u00f1o Gray-Macapagal, attested to this fact. She claimed that she often sees Florencio Marquez and Aida Ramos riding a motorcycle together, go to mass together with their child, and even go to market together. Aida even admitted that her child is Florencio Marquez' son. She was even invited to the baptism and party of the child last February 11, 1994. The two had been deporting themselves as husband and wife and lived together until 1996. She knows that Josefina Marquez is the lawful wife of Florencio Marquez. She also knows Aida Ramos as she is her parents' neighbor at Taban. (Exhibit K, pp. 103-104, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nAdelfa Marquez, a daughter-in-law of Florencio Marquez who lives in the same house with the latter together with her family when Marquez returned from the USA in 1992, likewise gave her statement. She knows respondent to be the paramour of her father-in-law. From 1993 to 1994, Marquez lived with respondent at the latter's house in Taban, Libmanan, Camarines Sur. Allegedly, her father-in-law admitted to her that Aida Ramos wanted him to live with her and in fact, Marquez did live with her. Adelfa used to see her father-in-law in respondent's house whenever she goes to Naga City. She claims that the duo have not severed their relationship, in fact every Tuesday and Friday, Marquez leaves the house at 6:00 in the evening and returns in the morning. Sometimes, Adelfa opens the door for him. She knows this because Marquez asks her to cook early as he will go to the house of Aida. Sometimes when he comes home early in the morning of Wednesdays and Saturdays, he would tell her that he came from the house of Aida. In [the] month of January 1997, respondent and Marquez were still maintaining an affair as her father-in-law still goes to the house of Aida every Tuesday and Friday. In fact, on January 28, 1997, a Tuesday, her mother-in-law instructed her to follow her father-in-law, which she did discreetly and she saw him go to the house of Aida. (pp. 130-131, Vol. 2, Record)\n\nThe love affair of Mr. Marquez and the respondent is believed to be still existing even up to the present. Last November 1996, the two went to Manila together and upon their return, Mr. Marquez declared that nobody could ever deprive the respondent of her job. He admitted that he was still having an affair with respondent (p. 100, Sworn Statement of Josefina Marquez, Vol. 2, Record).\n\nx x x\nThe foregoing facts indubitably show that respondent deviated from the norm of conduct required of a government employee like her. Certainly, her actions are contrary to law, good morals and customs. Her behavior indicates a flagrant moral indifference to the opinion of the respectable members of the community. Respondent, allegedly being a rural bred and na\u00efve woman, was deceived by the persistent suitor whom she thought was a widower in shining armor out to save her and her young son from the clutches of despair and the pit of penury. This is credible a defense, even if she gave birth to a love child. But, the years after her knowledge of her man's marital status and her continued dalliance with him after such information, can no longer be justified. The testimonial and documentary evidences in this respect are not merely manifold but are also corroborative, convincing and trustworthy. There is likewise no showing that the complainant's witnesses are merely impelled by hatred or revenge or ulterior motive in revealing what they know.\n\nIn the examples given by former Commissioner Yango, we can draw by analogy that respondent's cohabiting with a man who is not her husband, maintaining him as a paramour, and getting pregnant while she has no husband, (respondent was able to seek an annulment of her marriage) (see sworn statement of Josefina Marquez), implies the commission of a misconduct. In this instance, there is plausible evidence that respondent, despite her knowledge of Florencio Marquez' marital status, took a defiant stand, and displayed in public her illicit relation with the latter, in contravention with the norms of conduct and of the community. Her constant appearances in public with Marquez: her riding in Marquez' motorcycle, attending mass with him, eating out in a restaurant, and going to Manila together, even with their son, reveals a behavior which is not in accord with the norm required by a government employee like her. Giving fatherly comfort and material support to one's child can be done even without a mother's presence. In fact, under the circumstances, what respondent should have done, was to fade discreetly in the background, whenever her son's father was around, to preclude any suspicion.\n\nIndeed, the private life of an employee cannot be segregated from his public life. (The Solicitor General, in his brief in Nera vs. Garcia, et al. G.R. No. L-13169, January 30, 1960). A public officer or employee's conduct, both in private and public, must be guided by the required norms of behavior. Any misconduct in one's private life will always reflect on his public existence and vice versa. [7] We adopt the findings, conclusions and recommendation of the investigating judge.\n\nIt can not be overemphasized that every employee of the judiciary should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty. Like any public servant, he must exhibit the highest sense of honesty and integrity not only in the performance of his official duties but in his personal and private dealings with other people, to preserve the Court's good name and standing. [8] This is because the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel. Thus, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and every one in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple of justice. [9]\n\nRespondent, in the instant case, is indeed guilty of violating this norm of conduct. It is borne out by evidence, testimonial or documentary, that she has maintained an illicit relationship with a married man, the husband of herein complainant Josefina Marquez. We do agree with the investigating judge that her continued relationship with Florencio Marquez even after she learned that he was already married is condemnable. Neither can we accept the defense that her constant meeting with Florencio Marquez was a necessity since the latter was fulfilling his obligations as a father to their son. Prudence dictates that if respondent was indeed serious in severing her relationship with Florencio Marquez, she should have discreetly kept a distance from him. There is even more reason to believe that she did not intend to break away from Florencio Marquez. This open relationship with a married man is certainly in contravention with the norms of conduct of the community. This public display of illicit relationship is considered a disgraceful and immoral conduct, one which calls for disciplinary action under the Civil Service Law and which the Supreme Court will never sanction on its employees. [10] We reiterate what was enunciated in Burgos v. Aquino : [11]\nThe Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of court personnel must be free from any whiff of impropriety, not only with respect to his duties in the judicial branch but also to his behavior outside the court as a private individual. There is no dichotomy of morality; a court employee is also judged by his private morals. These exacting standards of morality and decency have been strictly adhered to and laid down by the Court to those in the service of the judiciary. Respondent, as a court stenographer, did not live up to her commitment to lead a moral life. Her act of maintaining relation with Atty. Burgos speaks for itself. IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, we find respondent Aida Clores-Ramos guilty of disgraceful, immoral conduct and is hereby SUSPENDED for a period of one (1) year without pay. Let a copy of this decision be entered in respondent's personal record.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Pardo, and Ynares-Santiago, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , p. 1.\n\n[2] Id ., at 41-42.\n\n[3] Id., at 46-47.\n\n[4] Id ., at 51.\n\n[5] Id ., at 58.\n\n[6] Id ., at 64.\n\n[7] In Re: Investigation Report of the Letter-complaint of Mrs. Josefina Marquez against Aida Clores-Ramos (Aida Clores) Court Stenographer.\n\n[8] Estellar v .

JOSUE B. DUMLAO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nKAPUNAN, J.:\n\nBefore this Court on automatic review is the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City, Branch 27, dated April 29, 1997, in Criminal Case Nos. 7257-AF and 7258-AF sentencing accused-appellant Josue B. Dumlao to the supreme penalty of death for raping his two nieces.\n\nOn February 10, 1997, two separate complaints were filed before the Regional Trial Court of Cabantuan City, charging accused-appellant with rape. The first was filed by Jennifer Dumlao Matutino, assisted by her father Fernando Matutino. The complaint stated:\nCriminal Case No. 7257-AF\n\nThat on or about between the year 1991 and May 1996, at Barangays San Isidro and Sta. Lucia Old, respectively , Municipality of Zaragoza, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of force and lewd designs, violence and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously abuse and had sexual intercourse on the person of the undersigned against her will, to the damage and prejudice of herein complainant, a minor.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nCabanatuan City, Philippines, December 2, 1996.\n\n(Sgd.) JENNIFER D. MATUTINO\nComplainant [1] The second complaint was filed by Jennifer's older sister, Benita Dumlao Matutino, who was also assisted by her father Fernando Matutino. The complaint similarly charged accused-appellant as follows:\nCriminal Case No. 7258-AF\n\nThat on or about between the year 1991 and May 1996, at Barangays San Isidro and Sta. Lucia Old, respectively , Municipality of Zaragoza, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of force and lewd designs, violence and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously abuse and had sexual intercourse on the person of the undersigned against her will, to the damage and prejudice of herein complainant, a minor.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nCabanatuan City, Philippines, December 2, 1996.\n\n(Sgd.) BENITA D. MATUTINO\nComplainant [2] Upon arraignment, accused pleaded Not Guilty to both charges. Thereafter, as agreed upon by the parties, the two cases were tried jointly.\n\nThe prosecution, through its witnesses Dr. Raol Paculan, Benita Dumlao Matutino, Jennifer Dumlao Matutino, Dr. Agripina Reyes and Fernando Matutino established the following facts:\n\nThe victims, Benita Dumlao Matutino and Jennifer Dumlao Matutino are the daughters of spouses Fernando Matutino and Merlyn Dumlao. Both children were staying in the home of Virginia Baldonado, their maternal grandmother, since their parents became estranged in 1992. [3] Baldonado's house is located at Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija. They lived in said house with their grandmother, the accused-appellant whom they called \"Tito Judy\", who was the brother of their mother, \"Tito Nonong/Kuya Nonong\", \"Tatang Sonny\" and \"Ate Rowena\". The house, which had two storeys, had one bedroom on each floor. [4] Benita and Jennifer together with their grandmother, Ate Rowena and Kuya Nonong slept in the room located upstairs, while the accused-appellant slept downstairs in the room beside the kitchen. [5]\n\nJennifer, one of the victims, testified that sometime in May, 1996, at around 10:00 p.m., she was roused from her sleep by accused-appellant. [6] The latter lifted her from the bed where she and her sister Benita were sleeping, covered her mouth, and brought her to the room downstairs. [7] She was able to recognize him since the room was illuminated by a gas lamp. [8] Accused-appellant removed her clothes and lay beside her, then went on to kiss her cheeks and embrace her. Jennifer slapped the accused-appellant. He parted her legs, placed himself on top of her, removed his shirt, and inserted his penis into her vagina [9] for about ten minutes. [10]\n\nJennifer further stated that her grandmother was not in the house when she was raped by accused-appellant that night. Her grandmother was then confined in a hospital in La Paz, Tarlac. [11] Only she, her sister Benita and accused-appellant were left in the house. [12]\n\nJennifer kept quiet about the incident because accused-appellant threatened her with physical harm should she ever report the incident to anyone. [13] However, she told her sister Benita about what accused-appellant had done to her two days after the incident, and Benita in turn told Jennifer that she (Benita) was also raped by the accused-appellant. [14]\n\nThe physical examination conducted by Dr. Raol Paculan disclosed that Jennifer had multiple healed lacerations on her hymen at 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock positions, [15] and that her hymen was no longer intact, indicating that she had lost her virginity. [16]\n\nAt the time she was raped in May, 1996, Jennifer was only eleven (11) years old, having been born on July 12, 1984, [17] as indicated in her birth certificate. [18]\n\nBenita Matutino testified that sometime in May, 1996, at around 1:00 a.m., while she was sleeping in the room located on the second floor of her grandmother's house, she was awakened from her sleep by the accused-appellant, whom she found lying beside her and kissing her. [19] Benita recognized accused-appellant since the room where she was sleeping was lighted. [20] Accused-appellant later succeeded in undressing her despite her resistance by kicking and pushing him away from her, because he was much stronger than she was. Accused-appellant held her hands tightly, and threatened to kill her and her sister Jennifer if she resisted. [21] He then inserted his penis into her vagina. [22] Benita recounted that on the day she was raped by accused-appellant, only she, Jennifer and accused-appellant were in the house of her grandmother, because the latter and their other companions in the house were in the hospital. [23]\n\nBenita did not tell her grandmother about what happened because she was afraid that the accused-appellant would kill her and her sister. [24] It was only sometime after the accused-appellant left their grandmother's house in September, 1996 to reside elsewhere that Benita wrote an undated letter to their father informing him that she and Jennifer were raped by accused-appellant in May, 1996, and that he had repeatedly raped them since 1991. [25] Benita sent said letter through her friend Girlie Soliman. [26] The letter reads:\nTatay,\n\nBago ang lahat binabati ko kayo ng magandang araw. Sana ay lagi kayong nasa mabuting kalagayan na malayo sa anumang sakit lalo na at si Kuyang kaya nga pala ako sumulat ay dahil sa ipagtatapat ko sa inyo pasensiya na kayo kung idinaaan ko pa sa sulat dahil nahihiya ako sa inyong sabihin ito ng harap harapan eto ay dahil sa nangyayaring hindi maganda sa aming dalawa ni Jenny. Matagal na naming gusto itong sabihin at dahil rin natatakot ako na sabihin ito at nagkaroon ako ng lakas ng loob. Ito ay dahil kay Tito Jude na hinahalay niya kami binababoy pinagsasamantalahan ng hayop na yoon huwag ka sanang mabibigla sa sinabi kong ito dahil yaan ay matagal na sa aming ginagawa ni Judy nodon pang buo pa ang ating bahay noong buo pa ang ating pamilya naaawa ako kay Jenny bata pa siya ginanoon na siya debaling ako nalan huwag na siya dahil masyado pa siyang bata tay sana ay wag mo sila Divinang pabayaan dahil ayokong mangyari (ang nangyari) sa kanila ang nangyari sa amin ngayon nagpapasalamat ako at nagawa konang isumbong sa inyo at ngayon nandito ako kanila Merlinda dito ako nakatira marami sa aking umaampon isa lang ang nagustuhan ko kanila Ate Wennie mababait sila.

Madalas kong naiisip na kaya siguro sa akin ito ginawa ay dahil galit sila sa ating pamilya wag sana kayong magagalit kung wala ang address namin dito dahil ayoko ng umuwi sa atin sa asiyenda ayoko na tay sawang sawa na ako daig pa namin ni Jenny may asawa tay mahal na mahal kita si Nanay at ang aking mga kapatid.\n\nhanggang dito na lang ang aking sulat\n\nAng iyong anak\n\n(Sgd.) Benita Matutino\n\nI love you\nmy\nFamily [27] Subsequently, her father fetched Benita in Panganiban, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija where she was staying and verified from her whether what she said in her letter was true. Her father then asked his sister to fetch Jennifer from their grandmother's house.\n\nThereafter, he brought Jennifer and Benita to the police station in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija to report the crimes. [28] Benita executed a sworn statement before the police, stating that sometime in May, 1996, at around 1:00 a.m., accused-appellant undressed and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. She said that the accused-appellant had been raping her since she was nine years old. She also explained that she did not report the said incidents earlier because accused-appellant threatened to kill her if she told anyone regarding the same. [29]\n\nBenita also testified that on October 2, 1996, her father and a policeman brought her and her sister to the Dr. Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Research and Medical Center for physical examination. [30]\n\nThe physical examination conducted on Benita by Dr. Agripina Reyes revealed that the victim had multiple healed lacerations on her hymen at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 o'clock positions. [31] Dr. Reyes also stated that Benita's hymen was no longer intact, indicating that she had lost her virginity. [32]\n\nBenita was only 13 years old when she was raped by accused-appellant in May, 1996. [33] Her birth certificate which she presented in court indicates that she was born on August 14, 1982. [34]\n\nThe victims' father, Fernando Matutino, corroborated his daughters' statements. He told the court that on September 13, 1996, he received a letter from Benita informing him that she and Jennifer had been raped by accused-appellant. [35] Thereafter, he looked for his two daughters. When he found Benita, he asked her again whether what she said in her letter was true. She answered him in the affirmative. Subsequently, he brought his daughters to the police station in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija to report the crimes. [36] He executed a statement [37] which was used as basis for the filing of the criminal complaints against accused-appellant.\n\nThe defense presented three witnesses, namely Virginia Baldonado, the accused-appellant himself and Roel Dumlao.\n\nVirginia testified that sometime in May 28, 1996, when the alleged rapes were committed, she was confined in a hospital in La Paz, Tarlac where she stayed for three days. [38] Benita and Jennifer were left at her house. She said that accused-appellant stayed with her in the hospital on May 29, 1996 and he, together with her children Samuel, Roel and Rowena were with her when she was released therefrom. [39] Upon her return, her grandchildren made no report whatsoever about having been raped by the accused-appellant. [40] She further stated that accused-appellant seldom slept in her house since he was often out in the fields, located about two kilometers away from her house, pasturing ducks ( itik ), and that Benita and Jennifer only stayed with her in her house when they had classes. [41] Baldonado added that accused-appellant did not sleep in her house from May 1 to 31, 1996, and that Benita and Jennifer stayed in the house of her son Roel while she was confined in the hospital. [42]\n\nAccused-appellant denied the charges against him [43] and claimed that the filing thereof were probably instigated by the victims' father, stating that maybe because when he [Fernando Matutino] took another wife he charged us so that his relationship with us may be severed. [44] He claimed that since 1990 or 1991, he spent most of his time pasturing ducks. [45] From 1991 to May, 1996, his pasture area was in a field in Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija, which, according to him, was a two-hour walk from Baldonado's house. [46] His working hours were from 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. everyday. [47] He said that he seldom went home to his mother's house because he would usually sleep in the fields and his food and other needs were brought to him by his brothers. [48]\n\nRoel Dumlao, a younger brother of the accused-appellant, testified that sometime in 1996, before the schoolyear started, he engaged the services of accused-appellant to pasture some 600 ducks owned by him. [49] He said that accused-appellant was at all times attending to the ducks in a pasture area in Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija, which was located about two kilometers away from Baldonado's house. [50] Roel added that the distance between the pasture area and Baldonado's house can be negotiated by walking for less than one hour. [51] He stated further that sometime in May, 1996, his niece Jennifer stayed with him for about a month. Jennifer did not tell him anything about being raped by accused-appellant. [52]\n\nOn April 25, 1997, the trial court promulgated its Joint Decision, the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds and so holds the accused JOSUE DUMLAO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in each of the two cases, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of:\nDEATH in Criminal Case No. 7257-AF, and for him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages;\n\nDEATH in Criminal Case No. 7258-AF, and for him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00, as moral and exemplary damages; and\n\nto pay the costs of this suit.\nSO ORDERED. [53]\nAccused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in giving credence to the \"inherently incredible, inconsistent and contradictory testimonies\" of Benita and Jennifer. [54] With respect to Jennifer, accused-appellant points out that it is unbelievable for her not to have screamed upon finding that a man was lying next to her and performing sexual acts on her, and not to have attempted to wake her sister who was sleeping beside her. [55] He stresses that it was only during cross-examination when Jennifer said that accused-appellant brought her out of the room where she and Benita were sleeping and transferred to the room downstairs. [56] He also argues that it could not have been possible for him to have maintained his hand on Jennifer's mouth to keep her from crying out loud while kissing her, embracing her, taking off her clothes and pushing her legs apart. [57]\n\nAccused-appellant claims that Benita's testimony is likewise incredible, having stated that her sister was beside her when she was allegedly raped by accused-appellant, yet she did not scream or try to rouse Jennifer from her sleep to help her. [58]\n\nIt is also alleged by him that the testimonies of both complainants were not straightforward, but rehearsed, as evidenced for instance by the fact that they could tell the time during which they were raped even though it was not established that there was a clock in the room or whether any church bells chimed to indicate the time. [59] Moreover, it took complainants a long time before they reported the incidents to anyone, [60] and they failed to specify the threats supposedly made by him on them. [61]\n\nAccused-appellant also assails the credibility of the testimony of Fernando Matutino, stating that the latter had a grudge against his wife, accused-appellant's sister, who had earlier left him for another man. [62]\n\nHe argues further that even the medical findings of Dr. Raol Paculan and Dr. Agripina Reyes failed to conclusively prove that the hymenal lacerations found in both Benita and Jennifer were caused by the alleged rapes. Both physicians admitted that hymenal lacerations can be caused by pulling sharp objects, masturbation or scratching. [63]\n\nIn addition, accused-appellant argues that the trial court should have quashed the informations filed against him for being vague as to the time of the commission of the offense, because the informations stated that the rapes were committed \"on or about between the year 1991 and May, 1996.\" [64]\n\nAccused-appellant also alleges that the trial court demonstrated partiality in favor of the prosecution during the trial, in violation of his constitutional rights. He points out that the trial court judge actively participated in nine out of the ten hearings on the cases, by directly propounding questions to the witnesses. [65]\n\nThe Court is not convinced by accused-appellant's arguments.\n\nArticle 335 of the Revised Penal Code, which defined the crime of Rape prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 8353 (the Anti-Rape Law of 1997), states:\nWhen and how rape is committed. -- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:\nBy using force or intimidation;\n\nWhen the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and\n\nWhen the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.\nThe crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua:\n\nx x x\n\nThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances.\nWhen the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.\nIn reviewing the cases before us, the Court observed the following guidelines which it had earlier formulated for the review of rape cases:\n(1) an accusation of rape, can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove and even harder for the person accused to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense's evidence. [66]\nThe evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant raped his niece Jennifer who in May, 1996 was only 11 years old. [67] Jennifer positively identified accused-appellant in open court as the one who raped her sometime in May, 1996, at around 10:00 p.m.:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ | Jennifer Matutino do you know Jose Dumlao alias \"Judy\"?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Why do you know him?\nA | Because he is the brother of my mother, sir.\n | \nQ | In other words Josue Dumlao is your uncle?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Is Josue Dumlao, the accused in this case, present in Court?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Can you point to him?\nA | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ | Please point to him?\nA | Witness stood up and pointed to a man inside the Courtroom and who, when asked of his name answered Josue Dumlao.\n | \nATTY.

(The witness stood up and directly pointed to the accused Josue Dumlao) [68] The trial court observed that she testified as to the details of the rape committed upon Jennifer in no uncertain terms, in direct and unwavering statements.

[70]\n\nThe fact that she did not scream when accused-appellant started kissing her does not make her story less credible, contrary to accused's argument. It should be noted that Jennifer was sleeping before she was awakened by her accused-appellant's presence in her bed. The Court agrees with the Solicitor General that \"[i]n such a situation not everyone would scream because people react differently to shocking events\" [71] such as what Jennifer went through. Moreover, accused-appellant had moral ascendancy over the victim, being the uncle, hence, the natural tendency of the victim is not to scream but to struggle and resist quietly because of shock and confusion. [72]\n\nThe Court likewise agrees with the trial court's finding that Benita Matutino's testimony that she was raped by accused-appellant using force and intimidation sometime in May, 1996 is credible. Benita categorically stated that sometime in May, 1996, while she was sleeping in the room on the second floor of her grandmother's house, she was awakened from her sleep by accused-appellant, who was lying beside her and kissing her; [73] that accused-appellant was able to undress her despite the fact that she was kicking and pushing him away from her, because he was much stronger than she was; that accused-appellant held her hands tightly, and threatened to kill her and her sister Jennifer if she resisted him; [74] that accused-appellant succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina. [75] The credibility of her testimony was not found to have been diminished by the lapse of some four months before she reported what accused-appellant had done to her and her sister. As held by the trial court, immediately after accused-appellant left the house of her grandmother to reside elsewhere, Benita wrote a letter to her father, telling him that she and Jennifer were raped; she also fled from her grandmother's house to avoid further sexual molestation. [76] It has been held that delay in reporting rape incidents in the face of physical violence cannot be taken against the victim, because oftentimes, the rape victim's actions are dictated by fear rather than by reason. [77]\n\nThe trial court's evaluation of the victims' testimonies in the cases at bar is entitled to the highest respect because it had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses on the stand. Furthermore, as previously held by this Court in People vs. Rodegelio Turco , Jr. , [78]\nx x x when the offended parties are young and immature girls from the ages of twelve to sixteen, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed by court trial if the matter about which they testified were not true. x x x\nThe Court notes that the records of the cases fully support the lower court's findings.\n\nThe trial court held that the victims' testimonies were corroborated by the respective reports of the physicians who conducted physical examinations on them. The report of Dr. Paculo who examined Jennifer revealed that her hymen was no longer intact, indicating that she had lost her virginity, [79] and that the child had multiple healed hymenal lacerations at 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock positions. [80] Likewise, the physical examination report of Dr. Reyes who conducted the examination on Benita stated that she suffered multiple lacerations in her hymen at at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 o'clock positions, [81] and that her hymen was no longer intact, a sign that she was no longer a virgin. [82]\n\nNo error was committed by the trial court in giving more credence to the testimonies and other evidence presented by the prosecution than the accused-appellant's denial of the charges against him. All that accused-appellant offered in his defense was the alibi that he hardly slept in Baldonado's house because he spent most of his time pasturing ducks [83] in a field in Sta. Lucia Old, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija. According to him, it would take about two hours to walk from the pasture field to Baldonado's house and vice-versa. [84] Certainly, accused-appellant's alibi cannot prevail over the testimony of the victims and their positive identification of accused-appellant as the person who raped them. [85]\n\nWhile this Court affirms the finding of the lower court that the accused-appellant is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having raped both Benita and Jennifer, it cannot affirm the imposition of the penalty of death in either case because the relationship between accused-appellant to the victims, i.e., that he was their uncle and therefore a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree, was not alleged in either of the two complaints. [86] The relationship between accused-appellant and each of the two victims should have been specifically alleged in the criminal complaints for rape before the trial court imposed the death penalty upon accused-appellant. The reason behind this requirement was explained in People vs. Antonio Ferolino, [87] thus:\nThese seven attendant circumstances [ mentioned in Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. No. 7659 [88] ], given that they alter the nature of the crime of rape and thus increase the degree of the penalty, are in the nature of qualifying circumstances. Plainly, these attendant circumstances added by R.A. 7659 are not ordinary aggravating circumstances, which merely increase the period of the penalty. These are special qualifying circumstances which must be specifically pleaded or alleged with certainty in the information; otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed.\nHaving failed to allege that accused-appellant is the uncle, i.e., relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree of Benita and Jennifer, the penalty imposable for each charge of rape shall be reclusion perpetua .\n\nIt is also necessary to increase the award of damages as fixed by the trial court. The lower court in its decision ordered the accused-appellant to indemnify each of the victims in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) only, representing moral and exemplary damages. Under prevailing jurisprudence, however, the award of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil imdemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape. [89] The Court has previously explained that the indemnity authorized under the law [90] as civil liability ex delicto for the offended party is equivalent to actual or compensatory damages in civil law. [91] It is not to be confused with moral damages, which is awarded when it is shown that the victim suffered physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation and similar injury. [92]\n\nIn addition to civil indemnity, moral damages may be awarded to rape victims, [93] without need of proof other than the fact of the rape itself. [94] The fact that each of the victims suffered mental, physical and psychological trauma as a result of the rape are too obvious to still require the recital thereof at trial. [95] Under current rulings, the award of moral damages should be in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) for each crime. [96]\n\nFurthermore, where the existence of an aggravating circumstance is proven, as in the cases before us where the circumstances of minority and relationship were established, exemplary damages may be awarded, in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code. [97] Thus, an award of exemplary damages in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) for each count of rape in the cases before us is proper. [98]\n\nWHEREFORE , the joint decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City, Branch 27 in Criminal Case Nos. 7257-AF and 7258-AF finding accused-appellant JOSUE B. DUMLAO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in each of the two cases is hereby AFFIRMED , with the MODIFICATION that the penalty in each case is reduced to reclusion perpetua. Accused-appellant is likewise sentenced to pay the following amounts:\n\n(1) In Criminal Case No. 7257-AF, to pay complainant Jennifer Matutino Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages; and Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages; and\n\n(2) In Criminal Case No. 7258-AF, to pay complainant Benita Matutino Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages; and Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr., Gutierrez , and Carpio, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Records, Crim.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ALDRIN BERDADERO Y ARMAMENTO, APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N DEL CASTILLO, J.: Strict compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 regarding the custody and disposition of evidence against the accused may be excused under justifiable grounds. If the justifiable reason could no longer be determined due to the defense's failure to raise it in issue during trial, it is of vital importance to establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved since these would be determinative of whether the accused is guilty or not.[1]Factual AntecedentsOn March 28, 2003, an Information[2] was filed against appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento (appellant) for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 12861. The accusatory allegations of the Information read:That on or about March 25, 2003, at around 2:40 o'clock in the afternoon at Arrieta Subdivision (Brgy. 20), Batangas City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, dispense or deliver 0.04 gram of shabu, [also] known as \"methamphetamine hydrochloride\" a dangerous drug, which is a clear violation of the above-cited law.Contrary to Law.On arraignment, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. In the trial that ensued, the prosecution and the defense presented different accounts of the events that transpired prior to and during the appellant's arrest.The Version of the ProsecutionThe Investigation Section of the Batangas City Police Station received a report from an informant that the appellant was selling shabu. Thus, PO3 Danilo F. Balmes (PO3 Balmes) and PO2 Edwalberto M. Villas (PO2 Villas) organized a buy-bust operation and designated the informant as the poseur-buyer.Thereafter, the two police officers and the informant went to the target area and parked the van they were using in front of appellant's house. After alighting from the vehicle, the informant talked to the appellant. A few minutes later, the appellant went inside his house. When he returned, he handed to the informant two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance in exchange for the marked money. The informant then gave the pre-arranged signal that the sale was consummated.The police officers who were observing the transaction from inside the van apprehended the appellant and recovered the marked money from him. They apprised the appellant of his constitutional rights before taking him to the barangay hall to record the entrapment operation and the evidence seized from the appellant in the blotter. The informant turned over the plastic sachets to PO3 Balmes. They then proceeded to the police station.Upon their arrival, the buy-bust operation and the items confiscated from the appellant were recorded in the police blotter. The desk officer, PO1 Arnold delos Reyes (PO1 Delos Reyes), prepared the complaint sheet while PO3 Balmes placed markings on the plastic sachets. The first sachet was marked DFB-1 with the date 3-25-03, while the second sachet was marked DFB-2 with the same date. The sachets were then submitted for laboratory examination, which tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.The Version of the DefenseThe appellant claimed that he was a victim of frame-up. He testified that at around 2:40 in the afternoon of March 25, 2003, two men came to his house and introduced themselves as locksmiths. His mother allowed them to enter and showed them the defective keys. After a while, the men left, but they returned 10 minutes later, kicked the door open and handcuffed him. He asked why he was being arrested but no explanation was forthcoming. He was instead brought to the police station.The appellant denied that illicit drugs were recovered from him and that the two men who arrested him were PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas.Ruling of the Regional Trial CourtOn October 10, 2005, the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, rendered its Decision[3] convicting the appellant. The dispositive portion reads:Wherefore, finding the evidence of the Prosecution satisfying that degree of moral certainty, accused Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento is found Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of having violated Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 as set forth in the information filed in this case. He is therefore sentenced to pay a fine of P500,000.00 and to undergo life imprisonment pursuant to law. He is however, credited with his preventive imprisonment if he is entitled to any.The specimens subject of chemistry Report No. D-634-03 (Exhibit \"C\") made by Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas is confiscated and directed to be proceeded against pursuant to law.SO ORDERED.[4]Ruling of the Court of AppealsDissatisfied, the appellant appealed before the Court of Appeals (CA). However, in its Decision[5] promulgated on July 3, 2007, the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit and affirmed in toto the ruling of the trial court.IssuesThus, this appeal with the following assignment of errors:ITHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.IIASSUMING, THAT THE VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION IS CORRECT, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.[6]The appellant insists that no buy-bust operation ever transpired and that his arrest was unlawful. He also contends that the prosecution failed to prove that the alleged buy-bust operation complied with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules since the police authorities neither inventoried nor photographed the seized drugs and marked money in his presence or that of his counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice. The appellant likewise assails the authority of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas to conduct the alleged buy-bust operation for failure of the prosecution to prove that they were deputized by the PDEA as required under Section 81 of RA 9165. And even assuming that there was faithful compliance with the mandates of RA 9165, the appellant argues that the poseur-buyer's testimony became material and indispensable due to his denial of having committed the prohibited act of selling the dangerous drug. Thus, it is the appellant's conclusion that the seizure and custody over the seized drugs is void.Our RulingThe appeal is unmeritorious.The elements necessary to establish a case for illegal sale of shabu are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. What is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug in evidence.[7]The prosecution successfully proved the existence of all the essential elements of the illegal sale of shabu. The appellant was positively identified by police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation as the seller of the shabu presented in the case. PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas testified that their confidential informant acted as the buyer of the shabu from the appellant. It was likewise established that the sale actually occurred and that two sachets of shabu were sold for the price of P500.00. The marked money used in the buy-bust operation was duly adduced in evidence. The shabu sold by the appellant was also positively and categorically identified during trial.Prosecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation.[8] The trial court in this case, as affirmed by the CA, held that the testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas were unequivocal, straightforward, and consistent in material respects with each other and with other testimonies and physical evidence. We find no cogent reason to overturn said findings.The appellant's defense of frame-up must fail. We have previously ruled that frame-up is a banal defense of those accused in drug-related cases that is viewed with disfavor. Like the defense of alibi, frame-up is an allegation that can easily be concocted. For this claim to prosper, the defense must adduce clear and convincing evidence, which the appellant failed to do.[9] There was no proof proffered to overturn the presumption that the arresting police officers regularly performed their duties. The appellant also did not prove that the prosecution witnesses were maliciously motivated, which would put their credibility in doubt. Moreover, the failure to present the appellant's mother to testify and corroborate his defense of frame-up renders the same as self-serving thus unworthy of any weight in evidence.The appellant's contention that the buy-bust operation failed to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules fails to impress. Paragraph 1 of Section 21, Article II of said law outlines the procedure to be followed in the custody and handling of the seized drugs. Thus:Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instrument/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - x x x(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.x x x xThis provision is implemented by Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, viz.:(a) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over the said items.The failure of the prosecution to show that the police officers conducted the required physical inventory and photograph of the evidence confiscated pursuant to said guidelines, is not fatal. Indeed, the implementing rules that `non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over said items'.Notably, the defense did not raise this issue during trial. Be that as it may, we explained in People v. Del Monte[10] that what is of vital importance is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. The existence of the dangerous drug is a condition sine qua non for conviction for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very corpus delicti of the crime and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. Thus, it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. The chain of custody requirement performs the function of ensuring that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, so much so that unnecessary doubts as to the identity of the evidence are removed.[11]To be admissible, the prosecution must show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into possession of the police officers and until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it was offered in evidence.[12]Here, the testimonies of prosecution witnesses convincingly show that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal substance was properly preserved. PO3 Balmes marked the sachets containing shabu with his initials and the date of the appellant's arrest.[13] PO2 Villas confirmed that PO3 Balmes marked the same sachets of shabu sold by the appellant. PO1 Delos Reyes entered the arrest in the police blotter[14] then referred the appellant and the evidence to the Investigation Division.[15] PO3 Sergio del Mundo (PO3 Del Mundo) received the appellant and the evidence from PO1 Delos Reyes and prepared the request for laboratory tests on the specimens.[16] PO2 Villas brought the specimens and said letter request to the crime laboratory[17]and waited for the results.[18] Insp. Donna Villa P. Huelgas conducted the laboratory examination on the same specimens still bearing the markings of PO3 Balmes,[19] and which examination yielded positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride.[20] The results were given to PO2 Villas, who turned over the same to PO3 Del Mundo.[21]It is thus evident that the identity of the corpus delicti has been properly preserved and established by the prosecution. The appellant in this case has the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits of public officers and a presumption that public officers properly discharge their duties.[22] The appellant was unable to discharge such burden.The appellant's next argument that the evidence against him was obtained in violation of Section 86 of RA 9165 because the buy-bust operation was made without any involvement of the PDEA also fails to impress. This provision reads:SEC. 86. Transfer, Absorption, and Integration of All Operating Units on Illegal Drugs into the PDEA and Transitory Provisions. - The Narcotics Group of the PNP, the Narcotics Division of the NBI and the Customs Narcotics Interdiction Unit are hereby abolished; however they shall continue with the performance of their task as detail service with the PDEA, subject to screening, until such time that the organizational structure of the Agency is fully operational and the number of graduates of the PDEA Academy is sufficient to do the task themselves: Provided, That such personnel who are affected shall have the option of either being integrated into the PDEA or remain with their original mother agencies and shall, thereafter, be immediately reassigned to other units therein by the head of such agencies. Such personnel who are transferred, absorbed and integrated in the PDEA shall be extended appointments to positions similar in rank, salary, and other emoluments and privileges granted to their respective positions in their original mother agencies.The transfer, absorption and integration of the different offices and units provided for in this Section shall take effect within eighteen (18) months from the effectivity of this Act: Provided, That personnel absorbed and on detail service shall be given until five (5) years to finally decide to join the PDEA.Nothing in this Act shall mean a diminution of the investigative powers of the NBI and the PNP on all other crimes as provided for in their respective organic laws: Provided, however, That when the investigation being conducted by the NBI, PNP or any ad hoc anti-drug task force is found to be a violation of any of the provisions of this Act, the PDEA shall be the lead agency. The NBI, PNP or any of the task force shall immediately transfer the same to the PDEA: Provided, further, That the NBI, PNP and the Bureau of Customs shall maintain close coordination with the PDEA on all drug related matters.A perusal of the foregoing provision shows that it is silent as to the consequences of failure on the part of the law enforcers to seek the authority of the PDEA prior to conducting a buy-bust operation, in the same way that the IRR is likewise silent on the matter. However, by no stretch of imagination could this silence be interpreted as a legislative intent to make an arrest without the participation of PDEA illegal or evidence obtained pursuant to such an arrest inadmissible.[23]It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, or great public interests would be endangered or sacrificed, or great mischief done, such construction must be avoided, or the court ought to presume that such construction was not intended by the makers of the law, unless required by clear and unequivocal words.[24]As we see it, Section 86 is explicit only in saying that the PDEA shall be the \"lead agency\" in the investigations and prosecutions of drug-related cases. Therefore, other law enforcement bodies still possess authority to perform similar functions as the PDEA as long as illegal drugs cases will eventually be transferred to the latter. Moreover, the same provision states that PDEA, serving as the implementing arm of the Dangerous Drugs Board \"shall be responsible for the efficient and effective law enforcement of all the provisions on any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical as provided in the Act.\" It is only appropriate that drugs cases being handled by other law enforcement authorities be transferred or referred to the PDEA as the \"lead agency\" in the campaign against the menace of dangerous drugs. Section 86 is more of an administrative provision. By having a centralized law enforcement body, i.e., the PDEA, the Dangerous Drugs Board can enhance the efficacy of the law against dangerous drugs. To be sure, Section 86(a) of the IRR emphasizes this point by providing:Section 86. x x x(a) Relationship/Coordination between PDEA and Other Agencies - The PDEA shall be the lead agency in the enforcement of the Act, while the PNP, the NBI and other law enforcement agencies shall continue to conduct anti-drug operations in support of the PDEA x x x. Provided, finally, that nothing in the IRR shall deprive the PNP, the NBI, other law enforcement personnel and the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from effecting lawful arrests and seizures in consonance with the provisions of Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.It is therefore clear that PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas possessed and acted with authority to conduct the buy-bust operation, making the same valid.The appellant's final contention that the failure to present the poseur-buyer is fatal and entitles him to an acquittal, again fails to impress. The non-presentation of the poseur-buyer is fatal only if there is no other eyewitness to the illicit transaction.[25] The testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas sufficiently established that the appellant is guilty of selling a dangerous drug. Their referral to the shabu handed by the appellant to the poseur-buyer as \"something\" merely indicates that at the time of the sale, they could only presume that the specimen sold by the appellant was shabu since they were conducting a buy-bust operation. They still had to submit the specimen to the crime laboratory for testing which later tested positive for shabu. Thus, the fact that the poseur-buyer was not presented does not weaken the evidence for the prosecution.For the illegal sale of shabu, and there being no modifying circumstance alleged in the Information, the trial court, as sustained by the CA, correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment in accordance with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code and a fine of P500,000.00.WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01774 sustaining in all respects the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, convicting appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 is AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.Corona, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, and Perez, JJ., concur.[1] People v.

No. 179710, June 29, 2010 ]\n\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ALDRIN BERDADERO Y ARMAMENTO, APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ALDRIN BERDADERO Y ARMAMENTO, APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nDEL CASTILLO, J.:\n\nStrict compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 regarding the custody and disposition of evidence against the accused may be excused under justifiable grounds. If the justifiable reason could no longer be determined due to the defense's failure to raise it in issue during trial, it is of vital importance to establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved since these would be determinative of whether the accused is guilty or not. [1]\n\nFactual Antecedents\n\nOn March 28, 2003, an Information [2] was filed against appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento (appellant) for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 12861. The accusatory allegations of the Information read:\n\nThat on or about March 25, 2003, at around 2:40 o'clock in the afternoon at Arrieta Subdivision (Brgy. 20), Batangas City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, dispense or deliver 0.04 gram of shabu , [also] known as \"methamphetamine hydrochloride\" a dangerous drug, which is a clear violation of the above-cited law.\n\nContrary to Law.\nOn arraignment, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. In the trial that ensued, the prosecution and the defense presented different accounts of the events that transpired prior to and during the appellant's arrest.\n\nThe Version of the Prosecution\n\nThe Investigation Section of the Batangas City Police Station received a report from an informant that the appellant was selling shabu . Thus, PO3 Danilo F. Balmes (PO3 Balmes) and PO2 Edwalberto M. Villas (PO2 Villas) organized a buy-bust operation and designated the informant as the poseur-buyer.\n\nThereafter, the two police officers and the informant went to the target area and parked the van they were using in front of appellant's house. After alighting from the vehicle, the informant talked to the appellant. A few minutes later, the appellant went inside his house. When he returned, he handed to the informant two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance in exchange for the marked money. The informant then gave the pre-arranged signal that the sale was consummated.\n\nThe police officers who were observing the transaction from inside the van apprehended the appellant and recovered the marked money from him. They apprised the appellant of his constitutional rights before taking him to the barangay hall to record the entrapment operation and the evidence seized from the appellant in the blotter. The informant turned over the plastic sachets to PO3 Balmes. They then proceeded to the police station.\n\nUpon their arrival, the buy-bust operation and the items confiscated from the appellant were recorded in the police blotter. The desk officer, PO1 Arnold delos Reyes (PO1 Delos Reyes), prepared the complaint sheet while PO3 Balmes placed markings on the plastic sachets. The first sachet was marked DFB-1 with the date 3-25-03, while the second sachet was marked DFB-2 with the same date. The sachets were then submitted for laboratory examination, which tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu .\n\nThe Version of the Defense\n\nThe appellant claimed that he was a victim of frame-up. He testified that at around 2:40 in the afternoon of March 25, 2003, two men came to his house and introduced themselves as locksmiths. His mother allowed them to enter and showed them the defective keys. After a while, the men left, but they returned 10 minutes later, kicked the door open and handcuffed him. He asked why he was being arrested but no explanation was forthcoming. He was instead brought to the police station.\n\nThe appellant denied that illicit drugs were recovered from him and that the two men who arrested him were PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas.\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\n\nOn October 10, 2005, the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, rendered its Decision [3] convicting the appellant. The dispositive portion reads:\n\nWherefore, finding the evidence of the Prosecution satisfying that degree of moral certainty, accused Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento is found Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of having violated Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 as set forth in the information filed in this case. He is therefore sentenced to pay a fine of P500,000.00 and to undergo life imprisonment pursuant to law. He is however, credited with his preventive imprisonment if he is entitled to any.\n\nThe specimens subject of chemistry Report No. D-634-03 (Exhibit \"C\") made by Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas is confiscated and directed to be proceeded against pursuant to law.\n\nSO ORDERED. [4]\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\n\nDissatisfied, the appellant appealed before the Court of Appeals (CA). However, in its Decision [5] promulgated on July 3, 2007, the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit and affirmed in toto the ruling of the trial court.\n\nIssues\n\nThus, this appeal with the following assignment of errors:\n\nI\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.\n\nII\n\nASSUMING, THAT THE VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION IS CORRECT, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. [6]\nThe appellant insists that no buy-bust operation ever transpired and that his arrest was unlawful. He also contends that the prosecution failed to prove that the alleged buy-bust operation complied with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules since the police authorities neither inventoried nor photographed the seized drugs and marked money in his presence or that of his counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice. The appellant likewise assails the authority of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas to conduct the alleged buy-bust operation for failure of the prosecution to prove that they were deputized by the PDEA as required under Section 81 of RA 9165. And even assuming that there was faithful compliance with the mandates of RA 9165, the appellant argues that the poseur-buyer's testimony became material and indispensable due to his denial of having committed the prohibited act of selling the dangerous drug. Thus, it is the appellant's conclusion that the seizure and custody over the seized drugs is void.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe appeal is unmeritorious.\n\nThe elements necessary to establish a case for illegal sale of shabu are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. What is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug in evidence. [7]\n\nThe prosecution successfully proved the existence of all the essential elements of the illegal sale of shabu . The appellant was positively identified by police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation as the seller of the shabu presented in the case. PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas testified that their confidential informant acted as the buyer of the shabu from the appellant. It was likewise established that the sale actually occurred and that two sachets of shabu were sold for the price of P500.00. The marked money used in the buy-bust operation was duly adduced in evidence. The shabu sold by the appellant was also positively and categorically identified during trial.\n\nProsecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation. [8] The trial court in this case, as affirmed by the CA, held that the testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas were unequivocal, straightforward, and consistent in material respects with each other and with other testimonies and physical evidence. We find no cogent reason to overturn said findings.\n\nThe appellant's defense of frame-up must fail. We have previously ruled that frame-up is a banal defense of those accused in drug-related cases that is viewed with disfavor. Like the defense of alibi, frame-up is an allegation that can easily be concocted. For this claim to prosper, the defense must adduce clear and convincing evidence, which the appellant failed to do. [9] There was no proof proffered to overturn the presumption that the arresting police officers regularly performed their duties. The appellant also did not prove that the prosecution witnesses were maliciously motivated, which would put their credibility in doubt. Moreover, the failure to present the appellant's mother to testify and corroborate his defense of frame-up renders the same as self-serving thus unworthy of any weight in evidence.\n\nThe appellant's contention that the buy-bust operation failed to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules fails to impress. Paragraph 1 of Section 21, Article II of said law outlines the procedure to be followed in the custody and handling of the seized drugs. Thus:\n\nSection 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instrument/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - x x x\n\n(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.\n\nx x x x\n\nThis provision is implemented by Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, viz .:\n\n(a) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over the said items.\n\nThe failure of the prosecution to show that the police officers conducted the required physical inventory and photograph of the evidence confiscated pursuant to said guidelines, is not fatal. Indeed, the implementing rules that `non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizure of and custody over said items'.\n\nNotably, the defense did not raise this issue during trial. Be that as it may, we explained in People v. Del Monte [10] that what is of vital importance is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. The existence of the dangerous drug is a condition sine qua non for conviction for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very corpus delicti of the crime and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. Thus, it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. The chain of custody requirement performs the function of ensuring that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, so much so that unnecessary doubts as to the identity of the evidence are removed. [11]\n\nTo be admissible, the prosecution must show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into possession of the police officers and until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it was offered in evidence. [12]\n\nHere, the testimonies of prosecution witnesses convincingly show that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal substance was properly preserved. PO3 Balmes marked the sachets containing shabu with his initials and the date of the appellant's arrest. [13] PO2 Villas confirmed that PO3 Balmes marked the same sachets of shabu sold by the appellant. PO1 Delos Reyes entered the arrest in the police blotter [14] then referred the appellant and the evidence to the Investigation Division. [15] PO3 Sergio del Mundo (PO3 Del Mundo) received the appellant and the evidence from PO1 Delos Reyes and prepared the request for laboratory tests on the specimens. [16] PO2 Villas brought the specimens and said letter request to the crime laboratory [17] and waited for the results. [18] Insp. Donna Villa P. Huelgas conducted the laboratory examination on the same specimens still bearing the markings of PO3 Balmes, [19] and which examination yielded positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride. [20] The results were given to PO2 Villas, who turned over the same to PO3 Del Mundo. [21]\n\nIt is thus evident that the identity of the corpus delicti has been properly preserved and established by the prosecution. The appellant in this case has the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits of public officers and a presumption that public officers properly discharge their duties. [22] The appellant was unable to discharge such burden.\n\nThe appellant's next argument that the evidence against him was obtained in violation of Section 86 of RA 9165 because the buy-bust operation was made without any involvement of the PDEA also fails to impress. This provision reads:\n\nSEC. 86. Transfer, Absorption, and Integration of All Operating Units on Illegal Drugs into the PDEA and Transitory Provisions. - The Narcotics Group of the PNP, the Narcotics Division of the NBI and the Customs Narcotics Interdiction Unit are hereby abolished; however they shall continue with the performance of their task as detail service with the PDEA, subject to screening, until such time that the organizational structure of the Agency is fully operational and the number of graduates of the PDEA Academy is sufficient to do the task themselves: Provided, That such personnel who are affected shall have the option of either being integrated into the PDEA or remain with their original mother agencies and shall, thereafter, be immediately reassigned to other units therein by the head of such agencies. Such personnel who are transferred, absorbed and integrated in the PDEA shall be extended appointments to positions similar in rank, salary, and other emoluments and privileges granted to their respective positions in their original mother agencies.\n\nThe transfer, absorption and integration of the different offices and units provided for in this Section shall take effect within eighteen (18) months from the effectivity of this Act: Provided , That personnel absorbed and on detail service shall be given until five (5) years to finally decide to join the PDEA.\n\nNothing in this Act shall mean a diminution of the investigative powers of the NBI and the PNP on all other crimes as provided for in their respective organic laws: Provided , however , That when the investigation being conducted by the NBI, PNP or any ad hoc anti-drug task force is found to be a violation of any of the provisions of this Act, the PDEA shall be the lead agency. The NBI, PNP or any of the task force shall immediately transfer the same to the PDEA: Provided , further , That the NBI, PNP and the Bureau of Customs shall maintain close coordination with the PDEA on all drug related matters.\nA perusal of the foregoing provision shows that it is silent as to the consequences of failure on the part of the law enforcers to seek the authority of the PDEA prior to conducting a buy-bust operation, in the same way that the IRR is likewise silent on the matter. However, by no stretch of imagination could this silence be interpreted as a legislative intent to make an arrest without the participation of PDEA illegal or evidence obtained pursuant to such an arrest inadmissible. [23]\n\nIt is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, or great public interests would be endangered or sacrificed, or great mischief done, such construction must be avoided, or the court ought to presume that such construction was not intended by the makers of the law, unless required by clear and unequivocal words. [24]\n\nAs we see it, Section 86 is explicit only in saying that the PDEA shall be the \"lead agency\" in the investigations and prosecutions of drug-related cases. Therefore, other law enforcement bodies still possess authority to perform similar functions as the PDEA as long as illegal drugs cases will eventually be transferred to the latter.

To be sure, Section 86(a) of the IRR emphasizes this point by providing:\n\nSection 86. x x x\n\n(a) Relationship/Coordination between PDEA and Other Agencies - The PDEA shall be the lead agency in the enforcement of the Act, while the PNP, the NBI and other law enforcement agencies shall continue to conduct anti-drug operations in support of the PDEA x x x. Provided, finally , that nothing in the IRR shall deprive the PNP, the NBI, other law enforcement personnel and the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from effecting lawful arrests and seizures in consonance with the provisions of Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.\nIt is therefore clear that PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas possessed and acted with authority to conduct the buy-bust operation, making the same valid.\n\nThe appellant's final contention that the failure to present the poseur-buyer is fatal and entitles him to an acquittal, again fails to impress. The non-presentation of the poseur-buyer is fatal only if there is no other eyewitness to the illicit transaction. [25] The testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas sufficiently established that the appellant is guilty of selling a dangerous drug. Their referral to the shabu handed by the appellant to the poseur-buyer as \"something\" merely indicates that at the time of the sale, they could only presume that the specimen sold by the appellant was shabu since they were conducting a buy-bust operation. They still had to submit the specimen to the crime laboratory for testing which later tested positive for shabu . Thus, the fact that the poseur-buyer was not presented does not weaken the evidence for the prosecution.\n\nFor the illegal sale of shabu , and there being no modifying circumstance alleged in the Information, the trial court, as sustained by the CA, correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment in accordance with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code and a fine of P500,000.00.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal is DENIED . The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01774 sustaining in all respects the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 4, convicting appellant Aldrin Berdadero y Armamento for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 is AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nCorona, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro , and Perez, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] People v.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO BARAOIL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.R E S O L U T I O N REYES, J.: This is an appeal from the Decision[1] dated May 26, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03546, which affirmed with modification the Decision[2 ]dated August 15, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 51 of Tayug, Pangasinan, in Criminal Case Nos. T-3682 and T-3683, finding Antonio Baraoil (accused-Appellant) guilty for two crimes of rape defined and penalized under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353 and the Revised Penal Code.On October 20, 2004, the accused-appellant was charged in two informations[3] for the crime of rape allegedly committed, as follows:Criminal Case No. T-3682That on or about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of August 8, 2004, inside the comfort room adjacent to the Apo Rice Mill at Brgy. San Maximo, [M]unicipality of Natividad, [P]rovince of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above- named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously insert his penis into the vagina of [AAA], a minor[,] 5 years of age and thereafter finger the vagina of said [AAA], against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA].CONTRARY to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 8353.[4]Criminal Case No. T-3683That on or about 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon of August 8, 2004, inside the comfort room adjacent to the Apo Rice Mill located at Brgy. San Maximo, [M]unicipality of Natividad, [P]rovince of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above- named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously suck the vagina of said [AAA], a minor, 5 years of age, against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA].CONTRARY to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 8353.[5]During arraignment, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty. Trial on the merits proceeded.The accused-appellant is a neighbor of the victim's (AAA) family whom they consider and respect like an uncle.According to the evidence of the prosecution, on August 8, 2004, at about 2:00 p.m., five (5) year old AAA was walking near the house of the accused-appellant when the latter saw her. He asked where she was going then he invited her to take a ride with him on his bicycle. AAA acceded because accused-appellant is a friend of her parents. The accused-appellant and AAA biked together towards the town rice mill. BBB, the elder sister of AAA, saw them. Worried about AAA\u2019s safety, BBB sought the help of CCC, her other sister, and their cousin DDD to look for AAA.Upon arriving at the rice mill, the accused-appellant parked his bicycle against the wall, and pulled AAA inside the mill's comfort room. He pulled AAA's shorts as she was not wearing underwear. The accused- appellant then sat on a toilet bowl and unzipped his pants. He lifted AAA, seated her on his lap, and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina. AAA did not shout despite feeling pain.The accused-appellant threatened AAA not to tell his mother or father about what happened or else he will repeat the act. He then inserted his right forefinger in AAA's vagina. AAA saw his finger that was thrust into her. AAA did not shout although she was about to cry. The accused-appellant removed his finger then pulled up his pants.At that moment, BBB, CCC, and DDD arrived at the rice mill and saw the accused-appellant's bicycle. They entered and heard thumping sounds coming from the comfort room. The accused-appellant then suddenly opened its door and walked out. AAA followed him after a while towards his bicycle looking visibly sweating and walking with difficulty.CCC approached the accused-appellant and told him that they will take AAA home. The accused-appellant refused and told them that he will take AAA home after buying a new pair of slippers he needed for himself. He bought the pair of slippers and a chocolate-filled biscuit for AAA.After half an hour, the accused-appellant took AAA back to the comfort room of the same rice mill. There, he undressed her and sucked her vagina. While doing this, AAA begged the accused-appellant to take her home. The accused-appellant stopped and boarded her to his bicycle and brought her home.The next day, DDD asked AAA what happened when she was with the accused-appellant. AAA did not say anything but she started to cry until she told her mother EEE all that transpired. On August 10, 2004, EEE brought AAA to the police station where they reported the incident.For the defense, the accused-appellant denied the charges and preferred an alibi by stating that he was with his friend Renato at the fish pond at the time when the alleged rape took place. He claimed that they were fishing from 7:30 to 10:00 in the morning. They also drank gin at around 3:00 p.m. and went home at 4:00 p.m. He, moreover, claimed that AAA was nice to him before the alleged rape. However, AAA's family got mad at him after he disconnected their jumper connection from the power source. They even threatened that they will hack him to death. Thus, the accusation of AAA's family was a means of revenge.On August 15, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:WHEREFORE, finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two crimes of rape, respectively defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 8353 amending the Revised Penal Code provisions on rape, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the following:1. the indeterminate penalty of from (sic) six (6) years of prision correccional maximum as minimum to ten (10) years of prision mayor medium as maximum, for the rape committed as charged in Criminal Case No. T-3683; and, 2. the death sentence of a protracted kind, namely reclusion perpetua, for the rape committed in Criminal Case No. T- 3682.Pursuant to the stipulations arrived at by the parties at the pre-trial stage, the accused is likewise condemned to indemnify the private complainant for damages in the agreed total sum of [P]200,000.00; and, to pay the costs.SO ORDERED.[6]The trial court lent credence to the testimony of AAA that she was raped. The trial court found her testimony categorical, straightforward and candid. Moreover, in upholding the credibility of AAA, the trial court relied heavily on established doctrines in rape cases.On September 1, 2008, the accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal.[7] The CA, in a Decision dated May 26, 2010, affirmed the accused-appellant's conviction with modification, viz:1. In Criminal Case No. T-3682, appellant is ordered to pay private complainant AAA, the amounts of [P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]50,000.00 as moral damages and [P]25,000.00 as exemplary damages.2. In Criminal Case No. T-3683, appellant is convicted of Acts of Lasciviousness under Art. III, Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, in relation to Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and [twenty] 20 days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and; to pay the complainant AAA [P]15,000.00 as fine, [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages and [P]15,000.00 as exemplary damages.In both cases, costs against the appellant.SO ORDERED.[8]The CA sustained the conviction of the accused-appellant after finding that the testimony of AAA was credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. There was no reason to overturn the accused-appellant\u2019s conviction under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape considering that AAA was undeniably under 12 years old and that the accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with her. Furthermore, the CA also found that the acts of accused-appellant fall under the category of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in conjunction with Section 5, R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). However, with respect to the damages, the CA corrected the trial court\u2019s disposition on the matter and specifically awarded civil indemnity automatically upon proof of the commission of the crime, moral damages, and exemplary damages in view of the victim\u2019s minority.Hence, this case.The primary issue in this case is whether or not the accused appellant\u2019s guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt vis-a-vis his main defense that the rape charges were merely concocted to get back at him as leverage against his act of disconnecting the jumper owned by AAA's family.It should be noted that the records of this case were elevated to this Court on December 8, 2010, pursuant to the CA Resolution dated June 23, 2010, which gave due course to the notice of appeal filed by accused- appellant. In compliance with this Court's Resolution dated January 12, 2011, the parties submitted their respective manifestations stating that they are no longer filing Supplemental Briefs with this Court and are adopting all the allegations, issues and arguments adduced in their Briefs before the CA.This Court sustains accused-appellant\u2019s conviction.The law presumes that an accused in a criminal prosecution is innocent until the contrary is proven. This basic constitutional principle is fleshed out by procedural rules which place on the prosecution the burden of proving that an accused is guilty of the offense charged by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Whether the degree of proof has been met is largely left to the trial courts to determine. However, an appeal throws the whole case open for review such that the Court may, and generally does, look into the entire records if only to ensure that no fact of weight or substance has been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the trial court.[9]Courts use the following principles in deciding rape cases: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) due to the nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Due to the nature of this crime, conviction for rape may be solely based on the complainant\u2019s testimony provided it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.[10]After a meticulous review of the records of the instant case, the Court holds that the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.This Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the trial court's appreciation of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses' testimony. Findings of trial court relative to the credibility of the rape victim are normally respected and not disturbed on appeal, more so, if affirmed by the appellate court. This rule may be brushed aside in exceptional circumstances, such as when the court\u2019s evaluation was reached arbitrarily, or when the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied certain facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the case.[11] The assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a domain best left to the trial court judge because of his unique opportunity to observe their deportment and demeanor on the witness stand; a vantage point denied appellate courts - and when his findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court.[12]We quote with approval the following findings of the CA as to the ordeal gone through by AAA in the hands of the appellant, viz:AAA testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner and never wavered in positively identifying appellant as her rapist despite grueling cross-examination. The trial court thus found the testimony of AAA to have been amply corroborated... who bravely, unabashedly, straightforwardly and consistently narrated in court her harrowing ordeal, vexation and pain in the hands of the accused.AAA was categorical in stating that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina: Q: And when the two of you were inside the comfort room of the rice mill, what did the accused do if any? A: He undressed me and then he sat on the toilet bowl, he unzipped his pants and he thereafter placed me on his top. Q: And while he was placing you on his top, what did he do next if any? A: He inserted his penis into my vagina. Q: What did you do or feel when he inserted his penis into your vagina? A: I felt pain sir. xxx xxx Q: And after he inserted his penis into your vagina, and after he told you that, what happened next if any? A: He inserted his finger into my vagina sir. Even on cross, examination AAA was unwavering: Q: And when he sat on the toilet bowl you said he opened his zip? A: Yes, sir. Q: And then he lifted you and then place you on his top, is that correct? A: Yes, sir, Q: And then you felt pain because he was able to insert his penis into your vagina, is that what you mean? A: Yes, sir. Q: Now you would like to tell the Honorable Court that when he lifted you [and] placed you on hi (sic) lap and then at that time his penis entered your vagina? A: Yes, sir. A young girl would not usually concoct a tale of defloration; publicly admit having been ravished and her honor tainted; allow the examination of her private parts; and undergo all the trouble and inconvenience, not to mention the trauma and scandal of a public trial, had she not in fact been raped and been truly moved to protect and preserve her honor, and motivated by the desire to obtain justice for the wicked acts committed against her.x x x xx x x It is well-settled that the presentation of the medico-legal to testify on the examination of the victim and the medical certificate itself are not indispensable in a prosecution for rape. x x xx x x xVerily, AAA was able to prove through her testimony that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina, thereby consummating his intention to have carnal knowledge of her. After all, the prevailing rule is that when a woman of tender age says that she was raped, she has stated everything that is necessary to prove the commission of the crime. x x xx x x xWe find no reason to overturn the conviction of appellant under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape, it having been proven that AAA was under seven years of age when she was raped. The elements thereof had been overwhelmingly established in this case, specifically: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and(2) that the woman was below 12 years of age. On the other hand, the crime of rape by sexual assault was not duly established by the prosecution. x x xx x x xUnder jurisprudential law, a person's tongue can be considered as an 'instrument or object' with which the crime of rape by sexual assault may be perpetrated. In the instant case, however, the record shows that no actual insertion of the tongue was done by appellant to bring the act within coverage of Art. 266-A (2) of the RPC. Not by any stretch of the imagination can the word \u201csuck\u201d be considered as an insertion. Thus, the act complained of cannot be considered rape by sexual assault.Nonetheless, appellant's act falls under the category of crime of Acts of Lasciviousness, as defined under Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code: x x xx x x [I]n conjunction with Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, Section 5 x x x:[13]The accused-appellant\u2019s defense of alibi deserves scant consideration. Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and highly unreliable. To merit approbation, the accused-appellant must adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the situs criminis at the time the crime was committed, such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime when it was committed. Since alibi is a weak defense for being easily fabricated, it cannot prevail over and is worthless in the face of the positive identification by a credible witness that an accused perpetrated the crime.[14]As to the award of damages, this Court, however, believes that the amounts so awarded should be modified in line with existing jurisprudence regarding the amounts thereof such that civil indemnity is reduced to P50,000.00 instead of P75,000.00 while exemplary damages is changed to P30,000.00 instead of P25,000.00.[15] The accused-appellant is further liable for interest of 6% per annum on all the civil damages.WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision dated May 26, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03546 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that in Criminal Case No. T-3682, accused-appellant Antonio Baraoil is ordered to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus interest of 6% per annum on each of the amounts awarded reckoned from the finality of this decision.SO ORDERED.Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Perez, and Sereno, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Antonio L.

The accused-appellant stopped and boarded her to his bicycle and brought her home.\n\nThe next day, DDD asked AAA what happened when she was with the accused-appellant. AAA did not say anything but she started to cry until she told her mother EEE all that transpired. On August 10, 2004, EEE brought AAA to the police station where they reported the incident.\n\nFor the defense, the accused-appellant denied the charges and preferred an alibi by stating that he was with his friend Renato at the fish pond at the time when the alleged rape took place. He claimed that they were fishing from 7:30 to 10:00 in the morning. They also drank gin at around 3:00 p.m. and went home at 4:00 p.m. He, moreover, claimed that AAA was nice to him before the alleged rape. However, AAA's family got mad at him after he disconnected their jumper connection from the power source. They even threatened that they will hack him to death. Thus, the accusation of AAA's family was a means of revenge.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two crimes of rape, respectively defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 8353 amending the Revised Penal Code provisions on rape, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the following:\n\n1. the indeterminate penalty of from (sic) six (6) years of prision correccional maximum as minimum to ten (10) years of prision mayor medium as maximum, for the rape committed as charged in Criminal Case No. T-3683; and,\n\n2. the death sentence of a protracted kind, namely reclusion perpetua, for the rape committed in Criminal Case No. T- 3682.\nPursuant to the stipulations arrived at by the parties at the pre-trial stage, the accused is likewise condemned to indemnify the private complainant for damages in the agreed total sum of [P]200,000.00; and, to pay the costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6]\n\nThe trial court lent credence to the testimony of AAA that she was raped. The trial court found her testimony categorical, straightforward and candid. Moreover, in upholding the credibility of AAA, the trial court relied heavily on established doctrines in rape cases.\n\nOn September 1, 2008, the accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal. [7] The CA, in a Decision dated May 26, 2010, affirmed the accused-appellant's conviction with modification, viz :\n\n1. In Criminal Case No. T-3682, appellant is ordered to pay private complainant AAA, the amounts of [P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]50,000.00 as moral damages and [P]25,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\n2. In Criminal Case No. T-3683, appellant is convicted of Acts of Lasciviousness under Art. III, Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, in relation to Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and [twenty] 20 days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and; to pay the complainant AAA [P]15,000.00 as fine, [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages and [P]15,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nIn both cases, costs against the appellant.\n\nSO ORDERED . [8]\nThe CA sustained the conviction of the accused-appellant after finding that the testimony of AAA was credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. There was no reason to overturn the accused-appellant\u2019s conviction under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape considering that AAA was undeniably under 12 years old and that the accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with her. Furthermore, the CA also found that the acts of accused-appellant fall under the category of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in conjunction with Section 5, R.A. No. 7610 ( Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act ). However, with respect to the damages, the CA corrected the trial court\u2019s disposition on the matter and specifically awarded civil indemnity automatically upon proof of the commission of the crime, moral damages, and exemplary damages in view of the victim\u2019s minority.\n\nHence, this case.\n\nThe primary issue in this case is whether or not the accused appellant\u2019s guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt vis-a-vis his main defense that the rape charges were merely concocted to get back at him as leverage against his act of disconnecting the jumper owned by AAA's family.\n\nIt should be noted that the records of this case were elevated to this Court on December 8, 2010, pursuant to the CA Resolution dated June 23, 2010, which gave due course to the notice of appeal filed by accused- appellant. In compliance with this Court's Resolution dated January 12, 2011, the parties submitted their respective manifestations stating that they are no longer filing Supplemental Briefs with this Court and are adopting all the allegations, issues and arguments adduced in their Briefs before the CA.\n\nThis Court sustains accused-appellant\u2019s conviction.\n\nThe law presumes that an accused in a criminal prosecution is innocent until the contrary is proven. This basic constitutional principle is fleshed out by procedural rules which place on the prosecution the burden of proving that an accused is guilty of the offense charged by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Whether the degree of proof has been met is largely left to the trial courts to determine. However, an appeal throws the whole case open for review such that the Court may, and generally does, look into the entire records if only to ensure that no fact of weight or substance has been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the trial court. [9]\n\nCourts use the following principles in deciding rape cases: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) due to the nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Due to the nature of this crime, conviction for rape may be solely based on the complainant\u2019s testimony provided it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. [10]\n\nAfter a meticulous review of the records of the instant case, the Court holds that the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThis Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the trial court's appreciation of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses' testimony. Findings of trial court relative to the credibility of the rape victim are normally respected and not disturbed on appeal, more so, if affirmed by the appellate court. This rule may be brushed aside in exceptional circumstances, such as when the court\u2019s evaluation was reached arbitrarily, or when the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied certain facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the case. [11] The assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a domain best left to the trial court judge because of his unique opportunity to observe their deportment and demeanor on the witness stand; a vantage point denied appellate courts - and when his findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court. [12]\n\nWe quote with approval the following findings of the CA as to the ordeal gone through by AAA in the hands of the appellant, viz :\n\nAAA testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner and never wavered in positively identifying appellant as her rapist despite grueling cross-examination. The trial court thus found the testimony of AAA to have been amply corroborated... who bravely, unabashedly, straightforwardly and consistently narrated in court her harrowing ordeal, vexation and pain in the hands of the accused.\n\nAAA was categorical in stating that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | And when the two of you were inside the comfort room of the rice mill, what did the accused do if any?\nA: | He undressed me and then he sat on the toilet bowl, he unzipped his pants and he thereafter placed me on his top.\n | \nQ: | And while he was placing you on his top, what did he do next if any?\nA: | He inserted his penis into my vagina.\n | \nQ: | What did you do or feel when he inserted his penis into your vagina?\nA: | I felt pain sir. xxx xxx\n | \nQ: | And after he inserted his penis into your vagina, and after he told you that, what happened next if any?\nA: | He inserted his finger into my vagina sir.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: And when the two of you were inside the comfort room of the rice mill, what did the accused do if any? A: He undressed me and then he sat on the toilet bowl, he unzipped his pants and he thereafter placed me on his top. Q: And while he was placing you on his top, what did he do next if any? A: He inserted his penis into my vagina. Q: What did you do or feel when he inserted his penis into your vagina? A: I felt pain sir. xxx xxx Q: And after he inserted his penis into your vagina, and after he told you that, what happened next if any? A: He inserted his finger into my vagina sir.\nEven on cross, examination AAA was unwavering:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | And when he sat on the toilet bowl you said he opened his zip?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | And then he lifted you and then place you on his top, is that correct?\nA: | Yes, sir,\n | \nQ: | And then you felt pain because he was able to insert his penis into your vagina, is that what you mean?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n | \nQ: | Now you would like to tell the Honorable Court that when he lifted you [and] placed you on hi (sic) lap and then at that time his penis entered your vagina?\nA: | Yes, sir.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: And when he sat on the toilet bowl you said he opened his zip? A: Yes, sir. Q: And then he lifted you and then place you on his top, is that correct? A: Yes, sir, Q: And then you felt pain because he was able to insert his penis into your vagina, is that what you mean? A: Yes, sir. Q: Now you would like to tell the Honorable Court that when he lifted you [and] placed you on hi (sic) lap and then at that time his penis entered your vagina? A: Yes, sir.\nA young girl would not usually concoct a tale of defloration; publicly admit having been ravished and her honor tainted; allow the examination of her private parts; and undergo all the trouble and inconvenience, not to mention the trauma and scandal of a public trial, had she not in fact been raped and been truly moved to protect and preserve her honor, and motivated by the desire to obtain justice for the wicked acts committed against her.\n\nx x x x\n\nx x x It is well-settled that the presentation of the medico-legal to testify on the examination of the victim and the medical certificate itself are not indispensable in a prosecution for rape. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nVerily, AAA was able to prove through her testimony that appellant inserted his penis into her vagina, thereby consummating his intention to have carnal knowledge of her. After all, the prevailing rule is that when a woman of tender age says that she was raped, she has stated everything that is necessary to prove the commission of the crime. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nWe find no reason to overturn the conviction of appellant under Criminal Case No. T-3682 for the crime of statutory rape, it having been proven that AAA was under seven years of age when she was raped. The elements thereof had been overwhelmingly established in this case, specifically: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and\n\n(2) that the woman was below 12 years of age. On the other hand, the crime of rape by sexual assault was not duly established by the prosecution. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nUnder jurisprudential law, a person's tongue can be considered as an 'instrument or object' with which the crime of rape by sexual assault may be perpetrated. In the instant case, however, the record shows that no actual insertion of the tongue was done by appellant to bring the act within coverage of Art. 266-A (2) of the RPC. Not by any stretch of the imagination can the word \u201csuck\u201d be considered as an insertion. Thus, the act complained of cannot be considered rape by sexual assault.\n\nNonetheless, appellant's act falls under the category of crime of Acts of Lasciviousness, as defined under Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code: x x x\n\nx x x [I]n conjunction with Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, Section 5 x x x: [13]\nThe accused-appellant\u2019s defense of alibi deserves scant consideration. Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and highly unreliable. To merit approbation, the accused-appellant must adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the situs criminis at the time the crime was committed, such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime when it was committed. Since alibi is a weak defense for being easily fabricated, it cannot prevail over and is worthless in the face of the positive identification by a credible witness that an accused perpetrated the crime. [14]\n\nAs to the award of damages, this Court, however, believes that the amounts so awarded should be modified in line with existing jurisprudence regarding the amounts thereof such that civil indemnity is reduced to P50,000.00 instead of P75,000.00 while exemplary damages is changed to P30,000.00 instead of P25,000.00. [15] The accused-appellant is further liable for interest of 6% per annum on all the civil damages.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed Decision dated May 26, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03546 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that in Criminal Case No. T-3682, accused-appellant Antonio Baraoil is ordered to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus interest of 6% per annum on each of the amounts awarded reckoned from the finality of this decision.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Perez, and Sereno, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Associate Justice Antonio L.

      "title": "PROVINCE OF CAGAYAN, REPRESENTED BY HON. ALVARO T. ANTONIO, GOVERNOR, AND ROBERT ADAP, ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES OFFICER, PETITIONERS, VS. JOSEPH LASAM LARA, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N PERLAS-BERNABE, J.: This is a direct recourse to the Court from the Decision[1] of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 (RTC), through a petition for review on certiorari[2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, raising a pure question of law. In particular, petitioners assail the RTC\u2019s June 30, 2009 Decision in Civil Case No. 7077, enjoining them from disturbing the quarrying operations of respondent Joseph Lasam Lara (Lara).The FactsOn September 14, 2007, Lara obtained an Industrial Sand and Gravel Permit[3] (ISAG Permit) from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), authorizing him to conduct quarrying operations in a twenty-hectare area situated in Barangay Centro, Muncipality of Pe\u00f1ablanca (Pe\u00f1ablanca), Cagayan (Permit Area) and extract and dispose of sand, gravel, and other unconsolidated materials from the Permit Area. For the same purpose, Lara obtained an Environmental Compliance Certificate[4] (ECC) from the DENR Environmental Management Bureau (EMB).[5]On January 3, 2008, Jovy Balisi (Balisi), Lara\u2019s representative, went to the Cagayan Provincial Treasurer\u2019s Office (Treasurer\u2019s Office) to pay the extraction fee and other fees for Lara\u2019s quarrying operations but she was directed to first secure an Order of Payment from the Environmental and Natural Resources Officer, petitioner Robert Adap (ENRO Adap). However, when Balisi went to ENRO Adap, the latter refused to issue an Order of Payment. Despite various pleas from Balisi and Atty. Victorio N. Casauay (Atty. Casauay), Lara\u2019s counsel, ENRO Adap remained adamant with his refusal. This prompted Atty. Casauay to tender and deposit the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office corresponding to the said extraction fee and other related fees.[6]On January 11, 2008, Lara commenced his quarrying operations. Later that day, however, a total of four trucks loaded with sand and gravel extracted from the Permit Area were stopped and impounded by several local officials.[7] Consequently, Lara filed an action for injunction with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 7049, against the said officials, seeking to enjoin the stoppage of his quarrying operations. After due proceedings, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued enabling Lara to restart his business.[8]Nonetheless, on March 17, 2008, Lara received a Stoppage Order[9] dated March 13, 2008 (Stoppage Order) this time from Cagayan Governor Alvaro T. Antonio (Gov. Antonio), directing him to stop his quarrying operations for the following reasons: (a) the ISAG Permit was not in accordance with Republic Act No. (RA) 7942,[10] otherwise known as the \u201cPhilippine Mining Act of 1995,\u201d and its implementing rules and regulations; (b) Lara\u2019s failure to pay sand and gravel fee under Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07; and (c) [Lara\u2019s] failure to secure all necessary permits or clearances from the local government unit concerned as required by the [ECC].[11] Hence, Lara filed the present action for injunction and damages with an urgent and ex-parte motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction before the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 7077.In their Answer dated June 10, 2008, petitioners raised the following defenses: (a) the mere issuance of the ISAG Permit does not give Lara the right to commence his quarrying operations as he still had to comply with the terms and conditions stated therein; (b) Lara has neither secured all the necessary permits nor paid the local fees and taxes; and (c) Gov. Antonio was merely performing his duty to enforce all laws and ordinances relative to the governance of the Province of Cagayan pursuant to the provisions of RA 7160,[12] otherwise known as the \u201cLocal Government Code of 1991.\u201d[13]In an Order[14] dated August 11, 2008, the RTC granted Lara\u2019s application for a writ of preliminary injunction based on a prima facie finding that he is authorized to extract gravel and sand from the Permit Area. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration[15] which was, however denied on September 26, 2008.[16]During the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following facts: (a) that Lara was able to secure an ISAG Permit from the MGB and an ECC from the DENR-EMB; (b) that Lara deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office for the extraction and other related fees; and (c) that Gov. Antonio issued a Stoppage Order directing Lara to stop the quarrying operations in the Permit Area. The parties also determined that the submission of documentary evidence would be sufficient to reach a decision and as such, the RTC directed them to simultaneously file their respective memoranda.[17]The RTC RulingIn a Decision[18] dated June 30, 2009, the RTC made permanent the writ of preliminary injunction and thus, enjoined petitioners from stopping or disturbing Lara\u2019s quarrying operations.It held that Lara legally acquired the right to operate his quarrying business, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC issued by the MGB and the EMB, respectively, which are the government agencies tasked to grant or deny any application for quarrying of industrial sand and gravel.[19] In this regard, the RTC observed that if Gov. Antonio perceived any defect in Lara\u2019s ISAG Permit, the proper recourse would have been to bring the matter to the attention of the MGB and not to issue a Stoppage Order.[20] It further noted that Lara could not pay the extraction and other related fees only because ENRO Adap adamantly refused to issue an Order of Payment. In this relation, the RTC concluded that there was substantial compliance with the requirements since Lara, in good faith, tendered and deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office, which can be treated as Lara\u2019s payment of the pertinent fees.[21] Finally, the RTC found no need to touch on the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit before starting his quarrying operations, given that it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, pending before the same court.[22]Aggrieved, petitioners sought direct recourse to the Court via the instant petition.The Issue Before the CourtThe primordial issue raised for the Court\u2019s resolution is whether the RTC properly issued the permanent injunction subject of this case.Among others, petitioners argue that despite the issuance of the ISAG Permit, Lara has yet to comply with its terms and conditions \u2013 as he has yet to secure the necessary permits and clearances from the local government unit concerned \u2013 and hence, remains to be proscribed from conducting any quarrying operations.[23]On the other hand, Lara maintains that the MGB and DENR-EMB had already authorized him to extract sand and gravel from the Permit Area, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC, thereby dispensing with the need to secure any permit from the local government. In any case, he contends that the only reason why he failed to secure such permits was because the local government officials deliberately refused to process his applications without any legitimate reason whatsoever.[24]The Court\u2019s RulingThe petition is meritorious.It is well-settled that a writ of injunction would issue upon the satisfaction of two (2) requisites, namely: (a) the existence of a right to be protected; and (b) acts which are violative of the said right. In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive relief constitutes grave abuse of discretion. Injunction is not designed to protect contingent or future rights. Where the complainant\u2019s right is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of actual existing right is not a ground for an injunction.[25]In order for an entity to legally undertake a quarrying business, he must first comply with all the requirements imposed not only by the national government, but also by the local government unit where his business is situated. Particularly, Section 138(2) of RA 7160[26] requires that such entity must first secure a governor\u2019s permit prior to the start of his quarrying operations, viz:SECTION 138. Tax on Sand, Gravel and Other Quarry Resources. \u2013 x x x.The permit to extract sand, gravel and other quarry resources shall be issued exclusively by the provincial governor, pursuant to the ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)x x x xIn connection thereto, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cagayan promulgated Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07, Article H, Section 2H.04 of which provides:SECTION 2H.04. Permit for Gravel and Sand Extraction and Quarrying. \u2013 No person shall extract ordinary stones, gravel, earth, boulders and quarry resources from public lands or from the beds of seas, rivers, streams, creeks or other public waters unless a permit has been issued by the Governor (or his deputy as provided herein) x x x. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)A plain reading of the afore-cited provisions clearly shows that a governor\u2019s permit is a pre-requisite before one can engage in a quarrying business in Cagayan. Records, however, reveal that Lara admittedly failed to secure the same; hence, he has no right to conduct his quarrying operations within the Permit Area. Consequently, he is not entitled to any injunction.In view of the foregoing, the Court need not delve into the issue respecting the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit, especially since it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, which remains pending before the court a quo.WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the June 30, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 in Civil Case No. 7077 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.SO ORDERED.Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo, and Perez, JJ., concur.[1] Rollo, pp. 41-50.

JOSEPH LASAM LARA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nPERLAS-BERNABE, J.:\n\nThis is a direct recourse to the Court from the Decision [1] of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 (RTC), through a petition for review on certiorari [2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, raising a pure question of law. In particular, petitioners assail the RTC\u2019s June 30, 2009\u00a0 Decision in Civil Case No. 7077, enjoining them from disturbing the quarrying operations of respondent Joseph Lasam Lara (Lara).\n\nThe Facts\nOn September 14, 2007, Lara obtained an Industrial Sand and Gravel Permit [3] (ISAG Permit) from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), authorizing him to conduct quarrying operations in a twenty-hectare area situated in Barangay Centro, Muncipality of Pe\u00f1ablanca (Pe\u00f1ablanca), Cagayan (Permit Area) and extract and dispose of sand, gravel, and other unconsolidated materials from the Permit Area. For the same purpose, Lara obtained an Environmental Compliance Certificate [4] (ECC) from the DENR Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). [5]\n\nOn January 3, 2008, Jovy Balisi (Balisi), Lara\u2019s representative, went to the Cagayan Provincial Treasurer\u2019s Office (Treasurer\u2019s Office) to pay the extraction fee and other fees for Lara\u2019s quarrying operations but she was directed to first secure an Order of Payment from the Environmental and Natural Resources Officer, petitioner Robert Adap (ENRO Adap). However, when Balisi went to ENRO Adap, the latter refused to issue an Order of Payment. Despite various pleas from Balisi and Atty. Victorio N. Casauay (Atty. Casauay), Lara\u2019s counsel, ENRO Adap remained adamant with his refusal. This prompted Atty. Casauay to tender and deposit the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office corresponding to the said extraction fee and other related fees. [6]\n\nOn January 11, 2008, Lara commenced his quarrying operations. Later that day, however, a total of four trucks loaded with sand and gravel extracted from the Permit Area were stopped and impounded by several local officials. [7] Consequently, Lara filed an action for injunction with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 7049, against the said officials, seeking to enjoin the stoppage of his quarrying operations. After due proceedings, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued enabling Lara to restart his business. [8]\n\nNonetheless, on March 17, 2008, Lara received a Stoppage Order [9] dated March 13, 2008 (Stoppage Order) this time from Cagayan Governor Alvaro T. Antonio (Gov. Antonio), directing him to stop his quarrying operations for the following reasons: (a) the ISAG Permit was not in accordance with Republic Act No. (RA) 7942, [10] otherwise known as the \u201cPhilippine Mining Act of 1995,\u201d and its implementing rules and regulations; (b) Lara\u2019s failure to pay sand and gravel fee under Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07; and (c) [Lara\u2019s] failure to secure all necessary permits or clearances from the local government unit concerned as required by the [ECC]. [11] Hence, Lara filed the present action for injunction and damages with an urgent and ex-parte motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction before the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 7077.\n\nIn their Answer dated June 10, 2008, petitioners raised the following defenses: ( a ) the mere issuance of the ISAG Permit does not give Lara the right to commence his quarrying operations as he still had to comply with the terms and conditions stated therein; ( b ) Lara has neither secured all the necessary permits nor paid the local fees and taxes; and ( c ) Gov. Antonio was merely performing his duty to enforce all laws and ordinances relative to the governance of the Province of Cagayan pursuant to the provisions of RA 7160, [12] otherwise known as the \u201cLocal Government Code of 1991.\u201d [13]\n\nIn an Order [14] dated August 11, 2008, the RTC granted Lara\u2019s application for a writ of preliminary injunction based on a prima facie finding that he is authorized to extract gravel and sand from the Permit Area. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration [15] which was, however denied on September 26, 2008. [16]\n\nDuring the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following facts: ( a ) that Lara was able to secure an ISAG Permit from the MGB and an ECC from the DENR-EMB; ( b ) that Lara deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office for the extraction and other related fees; and ( c ) that Gov. Antonio issued a Stoppage Order directing Lara to stop the quarrying operations in the Permit Area. The parties also determined that the submission of documentary evidence would be sufficient to reach a decision and as such, the RTC directed them to simultaneously file their respective memoranda. [17]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\nIn a Decision [18] dated June 30, 2009, the RTC made permanent the writ of preliminary injunction and thus, enjoined petitioners from stopping or disturbing Lara\u2019s quarrying operations.\n\nIt held that Lara legally acquired the right to operate his quarrying business, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC issued by the MGB and the EMB, respectively, which are the government agencies tasked to grant or deny any application for quarrying of industrial sand and gravel. [19] In this regard, the RTC observed that if Gov. Antonio perceived any defect in Lara\u2019s ISAG Permit, the proper recourse would have been to bring the matter to the attention of the MGB and not to issue a Stoppage Order. [20] It further noted that Lara could not pay the extraction and other related fees only because ENRO Adap adamantly refused to issue an Order of Payment. In this relation, the RTC concluded that there was substantial compliance with the requirements since Lara, in good faith, tendered and deposited the amount of P51,500.00 with the Treasurer\u2019s Office, which can be treated as Lara\u2019s payment of the pertinent fees. [21] Finally, the RTC found no need to touch on the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit before starting his quarrying operations, given that it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, pending before the same court. [22]\n\nAggrieved, petitioners sought direct recourse to the Court via the instant petition.\n\nThe Issue Before the Court\nThe primordial issue raised for the Court\u2019s resolution is whether the RTC properly issued the permanent injunction subject of this case.\n\nAmong others, petitioners argue that despite the issuance of the ISAG Permit, Lara has yet to comply with its terms and conditions \u2013 as he has yet to secure the necessary permits and clearances from the local government unit concerned \u2013 and hence, remains to be proscribed from conducting any quarrying operations. [23]\n\nOn the other hand, Lara maintains that the MGB and DENR-EMB had already authorized him to extract sand and gravel from the Permit Area, as evidenced by the ISAG Permit and ECC, thereby dispensing with the need to secure any permit from the local government. In any case, he contends that the only reason why he failed to secure such permits was because the local government officials deliberately refused to process his applications without any legitimate reason whatsoever. [24]\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nIt is well-settled that a writ of injunction would issue upon the satisfaction of two (2) requisites, namely: ( a ) the existence of a right to be protected; and ( b ) acts which are violative of the said right. In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive relief constitutes grave abuse of discretion. Injunction is not designed to protect contingent or future rights. Where the complainant\u2019s right is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of actual existing right is not a ground for an injunction. [25]\n\nIn order for an entity to legally undertake a quarrying business, he must first comply with all the requirements imposed not only by the national government, but also by the local government unit where his business is situated. Particularly, Section 138(2) of RA 7160 [26] requires that such entity must first secure a governor\u2019s permit prior to the start of his quarrying operations, viz:\n\nSECTION 138. Tax on Sand, Gravel and Other Quarry Resources. \u2013 x x x.\n\nThe permit to extract sand, gravel and other quarry resources shall be issued exclusively by the provincial governor , pursuant to the ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nx x x x\nIn connection thereto, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cagayan promulgated Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07, Article H, Section 2H.04 of which provides:\n\nSECTION 2H.04. Permit for Gravel and Sand Extraction and Quarrying . \u2013 No person shall extract ordinary stones, gravel, earth, boulders and quarry resources from public lands or from the beds of seas, rivers, streams, creeks or other public waters unless a permit has been issued by the Governor (or his deputy as provided herein) x x x. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nA plain reading of the afore-cited provisions clearly shows that a governor\u2019s permit is a pre-requisite before one can engage in a quarrying business in Cagayan. Records, however, reveal that Lara admittedly failed to secure the same; hence, he has no right to conduct his quarrying operations within the Permit Area. Consequently, he is not entitled to any injunction.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court need not delve into the issue respecting the necessity of securing a mayor\u2019s permit, especially since it is the main issue in another case, Civil Case No. 7049, which remains pending before the court a quo .\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . Accordingly, the June 30, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 5 in Civil Case No. 7077 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo , and Perez, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 41-50.

No. 9881 (Formerly CBD 10-2607), June 04, 2014 ]\n[ A.C. No. 9881 (Formerly CBD 10-2607), June 04, 2014 ]\n\nATTY. ALAN F. PAGUIA, PETITIONER, VS. ATTY. MANUEL T. MOLINA, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N\nATTY. ALAN F. PAGUIA, PETITIONER, VS. ATTY. MANUEL T. MOLINA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nSERENO, C.J.:\n\nFor resolution by this Court is the dismissal by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Board of Governors of the administrative Complaint for DISHONESTY against respondent, Atty. Manuel Molina. Atty. Molina allegedly advised his clients to enforce a contract on the complainant\u2019s client who had never been a party to the agreement.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\nThe case involves a conflict between neighbors in a four-unit compound named \u201cTimes Square\u201d at Times Street, Quezon City. The neighbors are the following: 1) Mr. And Mrs. Gregorio M. Abreu, clients of Atty. Paguia; 2) Mr. And Mrs. Wilson Lim, clients of respondent Molina; 3) Dr. and Mrs. Eduardo Yap; and Dr. Belinda San Juan.\n\nThe clients of Atty. Molina entered into a contract with the other unit owners save for Mr. Abreu. The agreement, covered by a document titled \u201cTimes Square Preamble,\u201d establishes a set of internal rules for the neighbors on matters such as the use of the common right of way to the exit gate, assignment of parking areas, and security. Mr. Abreu, the client of complainant, Atty. Paguia, was not a party to the contract since the former did not agree with the terms concerning the parking arrangements.\n\nOn 4 February 2010, Atty. Paguia filed a Complaint for Dishonesty [1] with the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline against Atty. Molina [2] for allegedly giving legal advice to the latter\u2019s clients to the effect that the Times Square Preamble was binding on Mr. Abreu, who was never a party to the contract.\n\nIn his Answer, [3] Atty. Molina downplayed the case as a petty quarrel among neighbors. He maintained that the Times Square Preamble [4] was entered into for purposes of maintaining order in the residential compound. All homeowners, except Mr. Abreu, signed the document. [5]\n\nRespondent further stated in his Answer that Mr. and Mrs. Gregorio Abreu filed two cases against his clients, Mr. And Mrs. William Lim, on the belief that Mr. Abreu was not bound by the Times Square Preamble. The first case, was filed with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), which was an action to declare the Times Square Preamble invalid. The second suit was an action for declaratory relief. Both cases, according to respondent, were dismissed. [6]\n\nRespondent further claimed that another case had been filed in court, this time by his client, the Lims.\u00a0 They were prompted to file a suit since Mr. Abreu had allegedly taken matters into his own hands by placing two vehicles directly in front of the gate of the Lims, thus blocking the latter\u2019s egress to Times Street. The Lims filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 96, Quezon City, a Complaint for Injunction and Damages, coupled with a prayer for the immediate issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction, which was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-08-63579. According to respondent, the RTC granted the relief prayed for in an Order dated 12 December 2008. [7]\n\nAtty. Molina concluded that the above facts sufficiently served as his answer to the Complaint.\n\nOn 3 August 2010, Investigating Commissioner Victor C. Fernandez rendered a Report and Recommendation. He recommended dismissal for lack of merit, based on the following grounds: 1) the complaint consisted only of bare allegations; and 2) even assuming that respondent Molina gave an erroneous legal advice, he could not be held accountable in the absence of proof of malice or bad faith. [8]\n\nOn 14 May 2011, the IBP Board of Governors passed Resolution No. XIX-2011-210, adopting and approving the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner. [9]\n\nAtty. Paguia filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated 2 August 2011, but was denied by the IBP Board of Governors on 29 December 2012. [10] Notices of the denial were received by the parties on 21 March 2013. [11]\n\nNo petition for review has been filed with this Court.\n\nIt is worth noting that a case is deemed terminated if the complainant does not file a petition with the Supreme Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board\u2019s resolution. This rule is derived from Section 12(c) of Rule 139-B, which states:\n\n(c) If the respondent is exonerated by the Board or the disciplinary sanction imposed by it is less than suspension or disbarment (such as admonition, reprimand, or fine) it shall issue a decision exonerating respondent or imposing such sanction. The case shall be deemed terminated unless upon petition of the complainant or other interested party filed with the Supreme Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board\u2019s resolution, the Supreme Court orders otherwise . (Underscoring supplied)\nIn this case, Atty. Paguia received notice of the Board\u2019s resolution on 21 March 2013, as evidenced by a registry return receipt. To this date, this Court has yet to receive a petition for review from Atty. Paguia. Thus, for his failure to file a petition for review with the Court within 15 days, this case is deemed terminated pursuant to the above mentioned Section 12(c).\n\nNevertheless, we have gone over the records but we have no reason to deviate from the findings of the IBP Board of Governors.\n\nWhen it comes to administrative cases against lawyers, two things are to be considered: quantum of proof, which requires clearly preponderant evidence; and burden of proof, which is on the complainant. [12]\n\nIn the present case, we find that the Complaint is without factual basis. Complainant Atty. Paguia charges Atty. Molina with providing legal advice to the latter\u2019s clients to the effect that the Times Square Preamble is binding on complainant\u2019s client, Mr. Abreu, who was not a signatory to the agreement. The allegation of giving legal advice, however, was not substantiated in this case, either in the complaint or in the corresponding hearings. Nowhere do the records state that Atty. Paguia saw respondent giving the legal advice to the clients of the latter. Bare allegations are not proof. [13]\n\nEven if we assume that Atty. Molina did provide his clients legal advice, he still cannot be held administratively liable without any showing that his act was attended with bad faith or malice. The rule on mistakes committed by lawyers in the exercise of their profession is as follows:\n\nAn attorney-at-law is not expected to know all the law. For an honest mistake or error, an attorney is not liable . Chief Justice Abbott said that, no attorney is bound to know all the law; God forbid that it should be imagined that an attorney or a counsel, or even a judge, is bound to know all the law. x x x. [14]\nThe default rule is presumption of good faith. On the other hand, bad faith is never presumed. It is a conclusion to be drawn from facts. Its determination is thus a question of fact and is evidentiary. [15] There is no evidence, though, to show that the legal advice, assuming it was indeed given, was coupled with bad faith, malice, or ill-will. The presumption of good faith, therefore, stands in this case.\n\nThe foregoing considered, complainant failed to prove his case by clear preponderance of evidence.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Resolution of the IBP Board of Governors adopting and approving the Decision of the Investigating Commissioner is hereby AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nLeonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, Villarama, Jr. , and Reyes, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Docketed as CBD Case No. 10-2607.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 2-7.\n\n[3] Id at 23-27; Filed on 5 March 2010.\n\n[4] Id. at 8-14.\n\n[5] Id. at 24.

Villasor ( ACA Villasor ), regarding an incident between Process Server Salvador Toriaga ( Toriaga ) and Garcia.\n\nConsidering that the cases were all related as they essentially involved the same parties, issues and causes of action, they were ordered to be consolidated for expediency and exhaustive determination.\n\nA.M. No. P-09-2691 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 09-3040-P)\n\nIn his letter-complaint, Garcia charged his co-workers, Clerk of Court IV Monalisa A. Buencamino ( Atty. Buencamino ) with Misconduct; Records Officer I Jovita P. Flores ( Flores ) with Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and Falsification of Public Document; and Process Server Salvador F. Toriaga ( Toriaga ) with Conduct Unbecoming of a Court Employee. Garcia specifically alleged the following:\n\nDespite being on leave from September 1-5, 2008, Atty. Buencamino still officially placed the remarks such as \u201cout of office\u201d and \u201csleeping during office hours\u201d on their bundy cards for the month of September 2008.\n\nAs Records Officer II, Flores was responsible for signing and issuing court clearances. Flores, however, often left the office without permission. Thus, she made \u201cpre-signed\u201d court clearances making it appear that the court continued to issue the said clearances even when she was out of the office. More specifically, on September 19, 2007 between 1:00-2:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Flores\u2019 signature appeared in some of the court clearances despite the fact that she was at the Supreme Court, attending to her loan and only came back to the office at around 2:50 o\u2019clock in the same afternoon.\n\nToriaga exhibited acts which were unbecoming of a court employee in an incident that happened on September 19, 2008, as detailed in Garcia\u2019s letter [3] to Honorable Judge Bien, dated October 27, 2008 as follows:\n\u201c Humigit kumulang alas kwatro ng hapon habang ako ay nasa loob ng tanggapan ng Clerk of Court at nagtatrabaho, dumating at pumasok sa loob ng tanggapan itong si Salvador Toriaga lasing na lasing, nagsisigaw at nagwawala! Saglit lang at siya\u2019y nanlilisik ang mga matang nakatingin sa akin at ako\u2019y kanyang pinagmumura ng PUTANG INA MO, IKAW PARE, PUTANG INA MO! TUMATAE KA DIMO NILILINIS ANG KUBETA! PUTANG INA MO! Napamulagat ako sa aking kinauupuan dahil hindi ko akalain na sa akin pala galit na galit itong si Salvador Toriaga. Dugtong pa ni Salvador Toriaga \u201cPUTANG INA MO ME DALA AKONG BARIL, ME DALA AKO, LUMABAS KA, LUMABAS KA DIYAN! Sa puntong iyon ay halos nakapaikot na sa kanya ang mga empleyado ng tanggapan at ako naman ay tatayo sa aking pagkakaupo upang siya ay kausapin. Ngunit mabilis siyang nakahagilap ng \u201cstapler\u201d at ako\u2019y susugurin. Sa tagpong \u2018yon ay mabilis naman siyang nahawakan ng kanyang anak, ng guwardiyang si Catadman at ng ilang empleyado, at siya\u2019y kinaladkad papalabas. Habang papalabas sumigaw uli siya ng \u2018HINDI AKO TAKOT MAWALA SA OPISINA! HAYUP KA ME ARAW KA RIN SA AKIN\u201d Matapos siyang mailabas ng tanggapan, ako namay naupos na parang kandila dahilan sa nerbiyos. Alam kong tumaas ang presyon ng aking dugo kaya\u2019y akoy namahinga ng ilang minuto bago umakyat sa Executive Judge.\u201d [4]\nIn her Comment, [5] Atty. Buencamino denied the allegations against her and averred that the comments/annotations on the bundy card/daily time record of Garcia and his common-law wife, Honeylee Gatbunton-Guevarra ( Guevarra ), as well as of all the court personnel was a method to stop erring court employees from further wrongdoings such as sleeping, loafing or missing, playing computer games, doing nothing, cooking during office hours and other acts in violation of the civil service and Supreme Court rules and regulations or circulars. Atty. Buencamino also claimed having instructed her staff and other persons to list all court employees of the Office of the Clerk of Court ( OCC ) of their whereabouts, what they were doing and those sleeping during office hours at the time/period she was on leave. If those instructed could not write their reports on the logbook or journal, then she would be the one to write them upon her return to work.\n\nAtty. Buencamino further alleged that Garcia showed little concern for time lost from work as he was a habitual absentee, late comer, lazy, and indifferent. He did nothing everyday while listening to his music with headphone attached to his head and ears, slept during office hours, placed/piled the docket and records so high in order to hide while sleeping or doing nothing, and wore sunglasses inside the office in order not to get detected that he was already sleeping. She also averred that Garcia would be missing during office hours to go home and take care of his three (3) children with Guevarra\u00a0 and come back before office hours ended. [6] Atty. Buencamino claimed that the attitude, conduct and behavior of Garcia had fallen short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the administration of justice. [7]\n\nInsofar as the complaints against Toriaga and Flores were concerned, Atty. Buencamino claimed that Toriaga never complained about his work for 19 years and that he was not a quarrelsome person. Flores, on the other hand, had never issued pre-signed court clearances because she herself would not allow such act. The clearances marked as Annexes \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d and \u201cE\u201d were signed by Flores only after her return to the office, contrary to Garcia\u2019s allegations, and for the reason that the latter, being the officer next in rank authorized to sign court clearances, refused to sign them and told one Edwin Cara ( Cara ) to wait for the return of Flores. [8]\n\nOn her part, Flores alleged in her Comment [9] that upon her return to the office at around 2:50 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Cara presented to her the court clearances which did not bear any signature of any Records Officer I or any person next in rank to her. Attached to her comment was Cara\u2019s affidavit [10] to prove that she did not sign any blank form or pre-signed court clearances, contrary to Garcia\u2019s claim. Flores also averred that she had witnessed the confrontational incident between Garcia and Toriaga on September 19, 2008 and that Toriaga did not utter any threatening words or carry any gun. [11]\n\nFurthermore, Flores claimed that Garcia was one of their erring court employees who were always caught sleeping, loafing or missing, and doing nothing during office hours. [12]\n\nIn like manner, Toriaga, in his Comment, [13] denied Garcia\u2019s allegations against him and claimed that he did not threaten Garcia or bring any gun to work, as likewise contained by the report [14] of the building\u2019s security guard. He, however, admitted that he and Garcia shouted and hurled invectives at each other. Because of the said incident, they were called by Executive Judge Bien to settle things between them. As no settlement took place, they were asked to submit their respective written explanations. [15] Toriaga also mentioned having previously reported another misconduct of Garcia relating to the latter\u2019s misuse of their office comfort room to their other superiors namely: David Maniquis (Clerk of Court III), Rowena Ruiz (Administrative Officer II), Ferdinand Santos (Clerk III), Edwin Cara (Process Server) and Liza Macasaquit (Records Officer I-Appeal Cases), but no action was taken by any of them as they did not want to intervene. [16]\n\nToriaga also corroborated the claims of Atty. Buencamino and Flores regarding Garcia\u2019s behavior during office hours and that Garcia and Guevarra, who was married, were publicly known to be living together and had three (3) children; that Atty. Buencamino\u2019s comments on the logbook/journal and bundy card of Garcia were true; and that Flores did not sign any blank or make any pre-signed court clearances. [17]\n\nA.M. No. P-09-2687 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 09-3093-P)\n\nThis case arose from the formal letter [18] sent by Judge Bien to ACA Villasor where she reported the September 19, 2008 incident between Garcia and Toriaga. Allegedly, Toriaga got irked by Garcia\u2019s manner of using their office\u2019s comfort room, and out of anger, he went home and drank liquor. He then returned to the office and confronted Garcia. A shouting match between the two ensued.\n\nJudge Bien endeavored to talk to both parties immediately after the incident, but Toriaga already left the office premises and took a month-long leave of absence. Upon the latter\u2019s return to work on October 20, 2008, efforts were exerted to have the parties settle the matter amicably, but to no avail. [19]\n\nAttached to Judge Bien\u2019s letter were the report [20] of the security guard on-duty at the time of the incident and the respective statements [21] of Garcia and Toriaga.\n\nUpon receipt by the Office of the Court Administrator ( OCA ) of Judge Bien\u2019s formal letter, then Court Administrator (now Associate Justice) Jose P. Perez sent a notice [22] to Garcia and Toriaga requiring them to manifest their intentions to submit the case for evaluation by the said office. Toriaga submitted his letter [23] narrating the incident, while Garcia\u2019s letter [24] confirmed the submission of the case for evaluation and prayed for its early resolution.\n\nSubsequently, the Court in its Resolution, [25] dated September 2, 2009, upon the Court Administrator\u2019s recommendation, resolved to re-docket the complaint as a regular administrative matter and referred the same to the Executive Judge for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nA.M. No. P-14-3247 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 09-3238-P)\n\nThis case was an offshoot of the respective comments submitted by Atty. Buencamino, Flores and Toriaga on Garcia\u2019s complaint against them. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s Resolution, [26] dated September 9, 2009, upon the OCA\u2019s recommendation, the charges and counter-charges contained in the aforementioned comments were treated and docketed as a separate administrative complaint against Garcia and his alleged common-law wife, Guevarra. Pieces of evidence were submitted to prove the immoral relationship between the two and the infractions that both had committed, in violation of the existing rules and regulations, circulars and laws of the Civil Service Commission and of the Supreme Court. More specifically, Garcia was charged with habitual absenteeism and violation of office rules, while Garcia and Guevarra were charged with immorality for their common-law relationship, which relationship was of public knowledge.\n\nConsolidated Comment by Garcia and Guevarra\n\nIn their Consolidated Comment, [27] dated December 2, 2009, Garcia and Guevarra merely denied all the charges against them for being malicious, fabricated and baseless. It was their contention that Atty. Buencamino\u2019s act of placing the remarks on their Daily Time Record (DTR) constituted conduct unbecoming of an employee of the court. They emphasized that Atty. Buencamino was one of those previously found guilty of dishonesty and conduct unbecoming of a public servant in A.M. No. P-07-2352 Ireneo Garcia, et al. vs. Monalisa Buencamino and\u00a0 A.M. No. P-07-2353 Atty. Monalisa Buencamino vs. Ireneo Garcia, et al., where Atty. Buencamino was reprimanded and fined.\n\nAs to the alleged immoral relationship, Garcia and Guevarra categorically denied such imputation and averred that the relationship between them was purely official in character and that Guevarra was very much married to her husband, Rolando Guevarra, with whom she has two (2) children. [28]\n\nFindings and Recommendation of the Investigating Judge\n\nIn the September 9, 2009 Resolution [29] of the Court, the administrative cases were referred to Executive Judge Thelma Canlas Trinidad-Pe Aguirre ( Judge Aguirre ) of the Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City ( RTC ), for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nThus, on July 4, 2013, a resolution [30] in A.M. No. P-09-2691 was issued by Judge Aguirre recommending the dismissal of the complaints against Atty. Buencamino and Flores. Garcia testified that he did not see Atty. Buencamino place the remarks being complained by him on the specified dates on his DTR. He also admitted having no knowledge whether Flores filed a leave of absence. Garcia also testified not seeing Flores sign the clearances. [31]\n\nInsofar as Toriaga was concerned, Judge Aguirre recommended the imposition of the penalty of one (1) month suspension from office without pay for misbehavior, to serve as a deterrent to others. Garcia was meted out the penalty of suspension from office for one (1) month without pay for the inappropriate use of the office comfort room and for shouting invectives at Toriaga within the office premises. [32] These same findings and recommendation were made by Judge Aguirre in A.M. No. P-09-2687 , inasmuch as the facts of the case were identical. [33]\n\nOn July 10, 2013, another resolution [34] in A.M. No. P-14-3247 was issued by Judge Aguirre recommending the dismissal of the complaint against Garcia and Guevarra due to insufficient grounds for indictment. It was Judge Aguirre\u2019s conclusion that Atty. Buencamino was guilty of laches. The alleged wrongdoings of Garcia happened way back in 2008, and yet, Atty. Buencamino did not act on them. It was only a means of Atty. Buencamino to get even with Garcia for filing a complaint against her. [35]\n\nEvaluation and\nRecommendation of the\nOffice of the Court Administrator\nThe OCA agreed with the findings of Judge Aguirre in A.M. No. P-09-2691 and A.M. No. P-09-2687 and concluded that the recommendations made by the investigating judge were in order.\n\nThe OCA, however, concluded otherwise with respect to A.M. No. P-14-3247. Contrary to Judge Aguirre\u2019s ratiocination, the OCA stressed that it should not be whether a complainant had a motive in filing the complaint (to get even with a respondent who first filed a complaint against him, or the parties had a grudge against each other), but rather, it should be whether there was ample basis in law and evidence to hold a respondent liable for any offense. Consequently, the OCA found documentary and testimonial evidence showing that Garcia and Guevarra were remiss in their duties, which Garcia did not adequately refute. Further, the amorous affair between Garcia and Guevarra having been established, they could be held liable for immorality. The marriage certificate of Guevarra and the birth certificate of at least one of her purported three (3) children with Garcia were incontrovertible proof of such an illicit relationship. Nonetheless, the OCA opined that any neglect of duty on the part of the respondents would merely be an aggravating circumstance of the grave offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct, pursuant to the Civil Service Rules. [36]\n\nTherefore, the OCA recommended the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | the complaint against respondents Atty. Monalisa A. Buencamino, Clerk of Court IV and Jovita P.

Buencamino be DIRECTED to take appropriate action to ensure and maintain an efficient, effective and harmonious working relationship among all personnel in her office. [37]\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe Court adopts with modification the recommendations of the OCA.\n\nPublic service requires integrity and discipline. For this reason, public servants must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and dedication to duty. By the very nature of their duties and responsibilities, government employees must faithfully adhere to, hold sacred and render inviolate the constitutional principle that a public office is a public trust; that all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency. [38] Improper behavior, especially during office hours, exhibits not only a paucity of professionalism at the workplace, but also great disrespect for the court itself. Such demeanor is a failure of circumspection demanded of every public official and employee. [39]\n\nInsofar as the September 19, 2008 shouting incident is concerned, neither Garcia nor Toriaga denied it. In fact, Toriaga admitted hurling invectives against Garcia for the latter\u2019s improper use of their office comfort room. Garcia, on the other hand, did not refute the said imputation, but complained against the misbehavior displayed by Toriaga.\n\nIn De Vera, Jr. v. Rimando , [40] the Court held that the act of engaging in a shouting match, one even cursing the other, within the court premises, is censurable, to say the least. Court employees are supposed to be well-mannered, civil and considerate in their actuations, in their relations with both co-workers and the transacting public. Boorishness, foul language and any misbehavior in court premises diminishes its sanctity and dignity. [41]\n\nThe OCA, thus, was correct in finding Garcia and Toriaga both guilty for simple misconduct. Simple misconduct is defined as an unacceptable behavior which transgresses the established rules of conduct for public officers, work-related or not. [42] Although Garcia had committed an impropriety relating to the use of the office lavatory, it was not a license for Toriaga to make such outbursts during office hours and within the office premises. Clearly, both employees failed to live up to the high standards of propriety and decorum expected of employees of the Judiciary. [43] It must be stressed that, as employees connected with the administration of justice, discharge of the most exacting standards of conduct are required of them.\n\nAs regards Garcia\u2019s alleged habitual absenteeism, loafing and sleeping during office hours are concerned, the OCA failed to include in their recommendations the corresponding sanction for any finding of neglect of duty, although the OCA has clearly mentioned in its report [44] that:\n\nxxx On the contrary, there were documentary and testimonial evidence showing that respondents Garcia and Guevarra were remiss in their duties and that respondent Garcia was observed to be loafing and sleeping during office hours which he did not adequately refute. Nonetheless, any neglect of duty on their part would merely be an aggravating circumstance of the grave offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct. xxx [45]\n\nWhile the OCA correctly observed that Garcia had been loafing and sleeping during office hours, these acts, however, constitute two separate offenses as they are not embraced under the offense of neglect of duty. Loafing, just like frequent unauthorized absences, is a grave offense while sleeping during office hours, an act violative of office rules and regulations, is a light offense. More appropriately, Garcia was guilty of loafing for which the rules impose a penalty of suspension from work for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, dismissal for the second, [46] as well as violation of reasonable office rules and regulations with reprimand as the penalty for the first offense. [47] It must be remembered that by reason of the nature and functions of the judiciary, its employees must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional canon that public office is a public trust. Inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service, if only to recompense the government, and ultimately the people who shoulder the cost of maintaining the Judiciary. [48]\n\nAside from loafing and sleeping during office hours, Garcia also frequently absented himself from work. More specifically, he had incurred unauthorized absences as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n2008: | \nMay 8, 23, 26, 29 and 30 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[49]\nJuly 7, 22, 25, 28-29, 31[50] | - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate[51]\nAugust 1, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20, 28-29 | - 10 days sick leave, without medical certificate[52]\n2009: | \nMarch 2, 4, 11, 18, 1920 (\u00bd day), 23 (\u00bd day) | - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate[53]\nJuly 3, 15, 27-29 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[54]\nSeptember 15, 22, 23, 28-29 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[55]\n2010: | \nApril 14-16, 19-21, 26-27 | - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate[56]\nJuly 1-2, 7-9, 12-13, 15-16, 21, 23, 26-30 | - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate[57]\nOctober 7, 8 (\u00bd day), 11-14, 22 | - 6.5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[58]\n2011: | \nFebruary | - 8 days sick leave, without medical certificate[59]\nMarch 1, 3-4, 7, 14-1522-24 | - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate[60]\nMay 5, 9, 11-13, 17, 23 | - 7 days sick leave, without medical certificate[61]\nJune 7-10, 13-17, 22, 24, 28 | - 12 days sick leave, without medical certificate[62]\nAugust 1, 7-8, 28-29 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[63]\nOctober 5-7, 10-11 | - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate[64]\nDecember 6-9, 13-14, 16, 20-23, 26-29 | - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate[65]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n2008: May 8, 23, 26, 29 and 30 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [49] July 7, 22, 25, 28-29, 31 [50] - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate [51] August 1, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20, 28-29 - 10 days sick leave, without medical certificate [52] 2009: March 2, 4, 11, 18, 19\n20 (\u00bd day), 23 (\u00bd day) - 6 days sick leave, without medical certificate [53] July 3, 15, 27-29 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [54] September 15, 22, 23, 28-29 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [55] 2010: April 14-16, 19-21, 26-27 - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate [56] July 1-2, 7-9, 12-13, 15-16, 21, 23, 26-30 - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate [57] October 7, 8 (\u00bd day), 11-14, 22 - 6.5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [58] 2011: February - 8 days sick leave, without medical certificate [59] March 1, 3-4, 7, 14-15\n22-24 - 9 days sick leave, without medical certificate [60] May 5, 9, 11-13, 17, 23 - 7 days sick leave, without medical certificate [61] June 7-10, 13-17, 22, 24, 28 - 12 days sick leave, without medical certificate [62] August 1, 7-8, 28-29 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [63] October 5-7, 10-11 - 5 days sick leave, without medical certificate [64] December 6-9, 13-14, 16, 20-23, 26-29 - 16 days sick leave, without medical certificate [65]\nAdministrative Circular No. 14-2002 provides that an officer or employee in the civil service shall be considered habitually absent if he incurs unauthorized absences exceeding the allowable 2.5 days monthly leave credit under the law for at least three (3) months in a semester or at least three (3) consecutive months during the year. Garcia filed applications for sick leave for the absences he had incurred. Said applications, however, were not accompanied by any medical certificate and, thus, the subject absences were considered as unauthorized. Moreover, the number of unauthorized absences incurred by Garcia exceeded that allowed by law. Therefore, he is deemed to be a habitual absentee. Consequently, just like loafing, frequent unauthorized absences or habitual absenteeism is a grave offense where the penalty of suspension from work for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense and dismissal for the second, [66] are imposed.\n\nAs regards the charge of disgraceful and immoral conduct against Garcia and Guevarra, the OCA\u2019s findings and recommendation are correct.\u00a0 Garcia and Guevarra failed to refute the alleged illicit relationship and simply labeled the charge against them as malicious, fabricated and baseless. On the other hand, incontrovertible proof such as the marriage contract [67] of Guevarra with her husband, the birth certificate [68] of one of Guevarra\u2019s children with Garcia, and the affidavit of acknowledgement/admission of paternity [69] by Garcia were presented to support the allegation of immoral conduct. Moreover, the genuineness and authenticity of these documents were never questioned. Thus, there is no doubt that Garcia and Guevarra had, and appears to still have, an illicit relationship while the latter is still legally married. Such a relationship is highly frowned upon, especially when court employees are involved because they are expected to maintain moral righteousness and uprightness in their professional and private conduct to preserve the integrity and dignity of the courts of justice. [70] For the grave offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct, the rules impose a penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and dismissal for the second offense. [71]\n\nIn sum, as modified, Garcia committed not only simple misconduct and disgraceful and immoral conduct but also the offenses of habitual absenteeism and loafing and violation of office rules and regulations. Guevarra, on the other hand, committed the offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct. In imposing the proper penalties especially with regard to multiple offenses, Section 55, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service provides that:\n\nSection 55. Penalty for the Most Serious Offense. \u2013 If the respondent is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge or count and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances.\nInsofar as Garcia is concerned, disgraceful and immoral conduct, and habitual absenteeism and loafing are the most serious offenses and, thus, the corresponding penalty shall be imposed in its maximum, after considering the other offenses as aggravating circumstances pursuant to the above rule in relation to Section 54 which provides:\n\nSec. 54. Manner of Imposition . \u2013 When applicable, the imposition of the penalty may be made in accordance with the manner provided herein below:\nThe minimum of the penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present.\n\nThe medium of the penalty shall be imposed where no mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present.\n\nThe maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present.\n\nWhere aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present, paragraph [a] shall be applied where there are more mitigating circumstances present; paragraph [b] shall be applied when the circumstances equally offset each other; and paragraph [c] shall be applied when there are more aggravating circumstances.\nAccordingly, the OCA\u2019s recommendation of suspension from work for one (1) year without pay against Garcia and suspension for one (1) month without pay against Guevarra are proper, after considering the mitigating circumstances of the latter\u2019s twenty (20) long years of service and her first ever commission of the offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nWith regard to the complaint against Atty. Buencamino and Flores, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the OCA\u2019s findings and recommendation of dismissal of the complaint as it was clearly without merit.\n\nFinally, in her January 15, 2014 Letter, [72] Flores appealed for the release of her terminal leave benefits, as the same were withheld at the time of her retirement, and expressed her willingness to set aside Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) as payment for any fine that she might incur. Since the complaint against her was correctly dismissed, her terminal leave benefits can be released.\n\nWHEREFORE,\nThe complaint against respondents Atty. Monalisa A. Buencamino, Clerk of Court IV, and Jovita P. Flores, Records Officer II, both of the Office of the Clerk of Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City, in A.M. No. P-09-2691 [formerly A.M.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JERIC PAVIA Y PALIZA @ \u201cJERIC\u201d AND JUAN BUENDIA Y DELOS REYES @ \u201cJUNE\u201d, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.R E S O L U T I O N PEREZ, J.: For resolution of the Court is the appeal filed by Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia (appellants) from the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04020. The CA affirmed the Judgment[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna which found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs punishable under Section 13, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165. Appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.The AntecedentsOn 29 March 2005, at around 6:00 in the evening, a confidential informant reported to SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a (SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a) of the San Pedro Municipal Police Station, San Pedro, Laguna, that a pot session was taking place at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d located at Barangay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Upon receipt of the information, SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a formed a team to conduct police operations against the suspect. The team was composed of the confidential informant, PO2 Rommel Bautista (PO2 Bautista), PO3 Jay Parunggao (PO3 Parunggao), PO1 Jifford Signap and SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a as team leader.[3]At around 9:00 in the evening of the same date, the team proceeded to the target area. When the team arrived, the members saw that Obet\u2019s house was closed. Since the house was not surrounded by a fence, PO2 Bautista approached the house and peeped through a small opening in a window where he saw four persons in a circle having a pot session in the living room. PO3 Parunggao then tried to find a way to enter the house and found an unlocked door. He entered the house, followed by PO2 Bautista and they caught the four persons engaged in a pot session by surprise. After they introduced themselves as police officers, they arrested the four suspects and seized the drug paraphernalia found at the scene.[4] Among those arrested were herein appellants, from each of whom a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance were confiscated by PO3 Parunggao after he conducted a body search on their persons.[5] PO3 Parunggao marked the plastic sachet he seized from appellant Pavia with \u201cJP,\u201d representing the initials of Jeric Pavia while that taken from appellant Buendia was marked, also by PO3 Parunggao, with \u201cJB,\u201d representing the initials of Juan Buendia.[6] These plastic sachets were transmitted to the crime laboratory for qualitative examination where they tested positive for \u201cshabu.\u201d[7]Consequently, appellants were charged with violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in two separate but identically worded informations which read:That on or about 29 March 2005, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused without authority of the law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody [of] METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing zero point zero two (0.02) gram, in the company of two persons. [8]When arraigned, both appellants pleaded not guilty to the offense.[9]A joint trial of the cases ensued.In defense, appellants provided a different version of the incident. According to them, on the questioned date and time, they were roaming the streets of Baranggay Cuyab, selling star apples. A prospective buyer of the fruits called them over to his house and requested them to go inside, to which they acceded. When they were about to leave the house, several persons who introduced themselves as policemen arrived and invited appellants to go with them to the precinct. There, they were incarcerated and falsely charged with violation of the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002.[10]The Ruling of the RTCThe trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove the offense charged through the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of its witness. The trial court noted that the police officers carried out a lawful arrest before they proceeded with the bodily search of appellants. Moreover, there was no clear and convincing evidence that the team of PO3 Parunggao was inspired by any improper motive when they carried out their operation. Thus, the testimony of PO2 Bautista on the witness stand, narrating the events leading to the apprehension of appellants, deserves full faith and credit.[11]The Ruling of the Court of AppealsOn appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, upon a finding that the evidence on record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements necessary for the conviction of the offense charged.[12]On the contention of appellants that their warrantless arrest was illegal and, therefore, the items seized from them as a result of that arrest were inadmissible in evidence against them, the CA held that this argument totally lacks merit. According to the CA:We stress at the outset that the [appellants] failed to question the legality of their warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused [is] estopped from assailing the legality of [his] arrest if [he] failed to move for the quashing of the Information against [him] before [his] arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before [he] enter[s] [his] plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.In any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrests conducted on [appellants] were valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant x x x.x x x xParagraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an in flagrante delicto arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught in flagrante delicto to be valid, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.After a careful evaluation of the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto.We emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the house where the pot session was conducted and to their arrest were triggered by a \u201ctip\u201d from a concerned citizen that a \u201cpot session\u201d was in progress at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d at Baranggay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the \u201ctime element\u201d involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be an extended period of time and it was then 9:00 p.m.). In view of the urgency, SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place to verify the report. At the place, the responding police officers verified through a small opening in the window and saw the accused-appellants and their other two (2) companions sniffing \u201cshabu\u201d to use the words of PO2 Bautista. There was therefore sufficient probable cause for the police officers to believe that the accused-appellants were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the accused-appellants indeed possessed and were even using a prohibited drug, contrary to law. When an accused is caught in flagrante delicto, the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.In the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the [appellants] were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in their possession. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search x x x that yielded two (2) heat-sealed plastic sachets of \u201cshabu.\u201d x x xx x x xAll the x x x requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at a certain \u201cObet\u2019s\u201d place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the [appellants] as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the [appellants] incident to their arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be \u201cshabu\u201d. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered in the living room. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.x x x xAs correctly found by the trial court, the [appellants'] story is unworthy of belief. Their denial must fail in the light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witness. As stated earlier, PO2 Bautista testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. He did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.Courts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP crime Laboratory on the drugs recovered from the [appellants] which revealed that the confiscated plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of \"shabu\u201d: two (2) heated transparent plastic sachet with markings \u201cJB\u201d and \u201cJP\u201d containing 0.02 gram of white crystalline substance each both yielded positive results.[13]With respect to appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody because the police operatives failed to strictly comply with Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, the CA has this to say:The chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.Contrary to what the [appellants] want to portray, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drug was shown not to have been broken. After the seizure of the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the [appellants'] possession and of the various drug paraphernalia in the living room, the police immediately brought the [appellants] to the police station, together with the seized items. PO3 Parunggao himself brought these items to the police station and marked them. The plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance was marked \"JB\" and \"JP\". These confiscated items were immediately turned over by PO2 Bautista to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon, Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City for examination to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. After a qualitative examination conducted on the specimens, Forensic Chemist Lorna Ravelas Tria concluded that the plastic sachets recovered from the accused-appellants tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug, per Chemistry Report Nos. D-0381-05 and D-0382-05.When the prosecution presented these marked specimens in court, PO2 Baustista positively identified them to be the same items they seized from the [appellants] and which PO3 Parunggao later marked at the police station, from where the seized items were turned over to the laboratory for examination based on a duly prepared request.Thus, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were first discovered until they were brought for examination. Besides, as earlier stated, the [appellants] did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during the tria1. The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs seized from the accused-appellants were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.Jurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply, with Section 2l (1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised. We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense. All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court.[14] x x xOur RulingWe deny the appeal.Appellants are charged under Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which provides:Section 13. Possession of Dangerous Drugs During Parties, Social Gatherings or Meetings. \u2013 Any person found possessing any dangerous drug during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons, shall suffer the maximum penalties provided for in Section 11 of this Act, regardless of the quantity and purity of such dangerous drugs.The elements for the illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 are the same as those for the violation of Section 11 of the law: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused,[15] with the additional element that (4) the accused possessed the prohibited or dangerous drug during a social gathering or meeting, or in the company of at least two persons.As correctly found by the CA, the evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements. The testimony of PO2 Bautista on this point is determinative: q. When you said PO3 Parunggao saw that the door of the house was not locked, what did you do? a. He entered the house and we followed him, maam [sic]. x x x x q. In what part of the house where [sic] this [sic] people engaged in a pot session? a. At the sala, maam [sic]. q.

PO3 Parunggao introduced ourselves as police officers, maam [sic]. q. What happened after that? a. We confiscated the drug paraphernalias [sic] and then PO3 Parunggao conducted body search and was able to confiscate shabu from the two of the people there maam [sic]. q. Where were you when PO3 Parunggao conducted a search? a. I was behind him, maam [sic]. q. Did you see him conducting a search? a. Yes, maam [sic]. q. What did you see him doing? a. I saw that he was able to confiscate small plastic sachet containing shabu, maam [sic]. q. From whom? a. From Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia, maam [sic]. q.

You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same? a. From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. x x x x q. You said that PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet with white crystalline substance from two person [sic], one was identified as Jeric Pavia, who was the other one? a. It was Juan Buendia, maam [sic] q. Please identify him if he is in court? a. That man also in the first row, at the right portion, wearing yellow shirt (pointed to a person who, when asked answered by the name of Juan Buendia). q. Where were you when PO3 Parunggao confiscated from Juan Buendia the plastic sachet of shabu? a. I was behind him, maam [sic]. x x x x q. On [sic] what part of the body of Juan Buendia was the item taken by Officer Parunggao? a. Also in [sic] his pocket, maam [sic].[16] The same testimony of PO2 Bautista also established the chain of custody of the prohibited drugs taken from appellants. Thus: q. You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated [sic] plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same? a. From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. q. And do you know what PO3 Parunggao do with the item? a. He placed marking on it, maam [sic]. q. In what place did he put the marking? a. At the police station maam [sic]. q. What markings did he place? a. It was marked JP representing the initials of accused Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. q. Where were you when Officer Parunggao placed that marking on the item? a. I was beside him, maam [sic]. q. Can you describe the plastic sachet? a. It is a small transparent plastic sachet which contains white crystalline substance otherwise known as shabu, maam [sic]. q. Who was in possession of the plastic sachet from the time PO3 Parunggao took it from the possession of Jeric Pavia up to the police station? a. It was P03 Parunggao, maam [sic]. q. I am showing to you a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings JP, please identify the same? a. This is the same item confiscated from Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. x x x x q. Did you come to know what Officer Parunggao do with the plastic sachet confiscated from Juan Buendia? a. He brought it to the police station, maam [sic]. q. And what did he do with it? a. He placed the markings JB, maam [sic]. q. Who was in possession of the plastic sachet with markings JB from Aplaya [where the pot session took place] to the police station? a. It was PO3 Parunggao, maam. q. I am showing to you a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings JB, please identify the same? a. This is the same item confiscated from Juan Buendia by PO3 Parunggao, maam [sic].[17] It is likewise important to note that it was PO2 Bautista himself who brought the request[18] for laboratory examination of the substance taken from appellants from the San Pedro Police Station to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Calamba City, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the confiscated items are preserved. Thus, the fact that the apprehending team did not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render appellants\u2019 arrest illegal or the items seized from them inadmissible in evidence.As held by this Court in the case of People v. Llanita:[19]RA 9165 and its subsequent Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require strict compliance as to the chain of custody rule. x x x. We have emphasized that what is essential is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201dBriefly stated, non-compliance with the procedural requirements under RA 9165 and its IRR relative to the custody, photographing, and drug-testing of the apprehended persons, is not a serious flaw that can render void the seizures and custody of drugs in a buy-bust operation.x x x xx x x. We recognize that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 may not always be possible under field conditions; the police operates under varied conditions, and cannot at all times attend to all the niceties of the procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence.Finally, both the trial court and the CA rejected appellants\u2019 defense of denial and frame-up for failure to substantiate the same.Indeed, the defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act. In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence. In the case before us, appellants failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their claims. Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations.[20] Consequently, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive, this Court will not appreciate the defense of denial or frame-up and instead apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents.[21]In view of the foregoing, we see no reason to deviate from the well-discussed decision of the CA, its findings and conclusions having been supported by both law and applicable jurisprudence.WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R.

CR-H.C. No. 04020. The CA affirmed the Judgment [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna which found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs punishable under Section 13, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165. Appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nOn 29 March 2005, at around 6:00 in the evening, a confidential informant reported to SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a (SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a) of the San Pedro Municipal Police Station, San Pedro, Laguna, that a pot session was taking place at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d located at Barangay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Upon receipt of the information, SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a formed a team to conduct police operations against the suspect. The team was composed of the confidential informant, PO2 Rommel Bautista (PO2 Bautista), PO3 Jay Parunggao (PO3 Parunggao), PO1 Jifford Signap and SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a as team leader. [3]\n\nAt around 9:00 in the evening of the same date, the team proceeded to the target area. When the team arrived, the members saw that Obet\u2019s house was closed. Since the house was not surrounded by a fence, PO2 Bautista approached the house and peeped through a small opening in a window where he saw four persons in a circle having a pot session in the living room. PO3 Parunggao then tried to find a way to enter the house and found an unlocked door. He entered the house, followed by PO2 Bautista and they caught the four persons engaged in a pot session by surprise. After they introduced themselves as police officers, they arrested the four suspects and seized the drug paraphernalia found at the scene. [4] Among those arrested were herein appellants, from each of whom a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance were confiscated by PO3 Parunggao after he conducted a body search on their persons. [5] PO3 Parunggao marked the plastic sachet he seized from appellant Pavia with \u201cJP,\u201d representing the initials of Jeric Pavia while that taken from appellant Buendia was marked, also by PO3 Parunggao, with \u201cJB,\u201d representing the initials of Juan Buendia. [6] These plastic sachets were transmitted to the crime laboratory for qualitative examination where they tested positive for \u201cshabu .\u201d [7]\n\nConsequently, appellants were charged with violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in two separate but identically worded informations which read:\n\nThat on or about 29 March 2005, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused without authority of the law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody [of] METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing zero point zero two (0.02) gram, in the company of two persons. [8]\nWhen arraigned, both appellants pleaded not guilty to the offense. [9]\n\nA joint trial of the cases ensued.\n\nIn defense, appellants provided a different version of the incident. According to them, on the questioned date and time, they were roaming the streets of Baranggay Cuyab, selling star apples. A prospective buyer of the fruits called them over to his house and requested them to go inside, to which they acceded. When they were about to leave the house, several persons who introduced themselves as policemen arrived and invited appellants to go with them to the precinct. There, they were incarcerated and falsely charged with violation of the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002. [10]\n\nThe Ruling of the RTC\n\nThe trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove the offense charged through the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of its witness. The trial court noted that the police officers carried out a lawful arrest before they proceeded with the bodily search of appellants. Moreover, there was no clear and convincing evidence that the team of PO3 Parunggao was inspired by any improper motive when they carried out their operation. Thus, the testimony of PO2 Bautista on the witness stand, narrating the events leading to the apprehension of appellants, deserves full faith and credit. [11]\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nOn appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, upon a finding that the evidence on record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements necessary for the conviction of the offense charged. [12]\n\nOn the contention of appellants that their warrantless arrest was illegal and, therefore, the items seized from them as a result of that arrest were inadmissible in evidence against them, the CA held that this argument totally lacks merit. According to the CA:\n\nWe stress at the outset that the [appellants] failed to question the legality of their warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused [is] estopped from assailing the legality of [his] arrest if [he] failed to move for the quashing of the Information against [him] before [his] arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before [he] enter[s] [his] plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.\n\nIn any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrests conducted on [appellants] were valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant x x x.\n\nx x x x\n\nParagraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an in flagrante delicto arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught in flagrante delicto to be valid, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.\n\nAfter a careful evaluation of the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto.\n\nWe emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the house where the pot session was conducted and to their arrest were triggered by a \u201ctip\u201d from a concerned citizen that a \u201cpot session\u201d was in progress at the house of a certain \u201cObet \u201d at Baranggay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the \u201ctime element\u201d involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be an extended period of time and it was then 9:00 p.m.). In view of the urgency, SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place to verify the report. At the place, the responding police officers verified through a small opening in the window and saw the accused-appellants and their other two (2) companions sniffing \u201c shabu \u201d to use the words of PO2 Bautista. There was therefore sufficient probable cause for the police officers to believe that the accused-appellants were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the accused-appellants indeed possessed and were even using a prohibited drug, contrary to law. When an accused is caught in flagrante delicto , the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.\n\nIn the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the [appellants] were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in their possession. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search x x x that yielded two (2) heat-sealed plastic sachets of \u201c shabu .\u201d x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nAll the x x x requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at a certain \u201cObet\u2019s\u201d place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the [appellants] as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the [appellants] incident to their arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be \u201cshabu\u201d. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered in the living room. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.\n\nx x x x\n\nAs correctly found by the trial court, the [appellants'] story is unworthy of belief. Their denial must fail in the light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witness. As stated earlier, PO2 Bautista testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. He did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.\n\nCourts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP crime Laboratory on the drugs recovered from the [appellants] which revealed that the confiscated plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of \"shabu\u201d: two (2) heated transparent plastic sachet with markings \u201cJB\u201d and \u201cJP\u201d containing 0.02 gram of white crystalline substance each both yielded positive results. [13]\nWith respect to appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody because the police operatives failed to strictly comply with Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, the CA has this to say:\n\nThe chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.\n\nContrary to what the [appellants] want to portray, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drug was shown not to have been broken. After the seizure of the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the [appellants'] possession and of the various drug paraphernalia in the living room, the police immediately brought the [appellants] to the police station, together with the seized items. PO3 Parunggao himself brought these items to the police station and marked them. The plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance was marked \"JB\" and \"JP\". These confiscated items were immediately turned over by PO2 Bautista to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon, Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City for examination to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. After a qualitative examination conducted on the specimens, Forensic Chemist Lorna Ravelas Tria concluded that the plastic sachets recovered from the accused-appellants tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug, per Chemistry Report Nos. D-0381-05 and D-0382-05.\n\nWhen the prosecution presented these marked specimens in court, PO2 Baustista positively identified them to be the same items they seized from the [appellants] and which PO3 Parunggao later marked at the police station, from where the seized items were turned over to the laboratory for examination based on a duly prepared request.\n\nThus, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were first discovered until they were brought for examination. Besides, as earlier stated, the [appellants] did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during the tria1. The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs seized from the accused-appellants were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.\n\nJurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply, with Section 2l (1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised. We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense. All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court. [14] x x x\n\nOur Ruling\n\nWe deny the appeal.\n\nAppellants are charged under Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which provides:\n\nSection 13. Possession of Dangerous Drugs During Parties, Social Gatherings or Meetings . \u2013 Any person found possessing any dangerous drug during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons, shall suffer the maximum penalties provided for in Section 11 of this Act, regardless of the quantity and purity of such dangerous drugs.\nThe elements for the illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 are the same as those for the violation of Section 11 of the law: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused, [15] with the additional element that (4) the accused possessed the prohibited or dangerous drug during a social gathering or meeting, or in the company of at least two persons.\n\nAs correctly found by the CA, the evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements. The testimony of PO2 Bautista on this point is determinative:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nq. | When you said PO3 Parunggao saw that the door of the house was not locked, what did you do?\na. | He entered the house and we followed him, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | In what part of the house where [sic] this [sic] people engaged in a pot session?\na. | At the sala, maam [sic].\nq. | And what was their reaction when PO3 Parunggao and the rest of the team barged in?\na. | They were surprised, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | And what did you do after that?\na. | PO3 Parunggao introduced ourselves as police officers, maam [sic].\nq. | What happened after that?\na. | We confiscated the drug paraphernalias [sic] and then PO3 Parunggao conducted body search and was able to confiscate shabu from the two of the people there maam [sic].\nq. | Where were you when PO3 Parunggao conducted a search?\na. | I was behind him, maam [sic].\nq. | Did you see him conducting a search?\na. | Yes, maam [sic].\nq. | What did you see him doing?\na. | I saw that he was able to confiscate small plastic sachet containing shabu, maam [sic].\nq. | From whom?\na. | From Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia, maam [sic].\nq. | If this Jeric Pavia is in court right now, will you be able to point to him?\na. | Yes, maam [sic].\nq. | Please point to him?\na. | That man in the first row wearing yellow shirt, maam [sic] (pointed to a person inside the courtroom who, when asked answered by the name of Jeric Pavia).\nq. | You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same?\na. | From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | You said that PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet with white crystalline substance from two person [sic], one was identified as Jeric Pavia, who was the other one?\na. | It was Juan Buendia, maam [sic]\nq. | Please identify him if he is in court?\na. | That man also in the first row, at the right portion, wearing yellow shirt (pointed to a person who, when asked answered by the name of Juan Buendia).\nq. | Where were you when PO3 Parunggao confiscated from Juan Buendia the plastic sachet of shabu?\na. | I was behind him, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | On [sic] what part of the body of Juan Buendia was the item taken by Officer Parunggao?\na. | Also in [sic] his pocket, maam [sic].[16]\n[END_TABLE]\n\nq.

This is the same item confiscated from Juan Buendia by PO3 Parunggao, maam [sic]. [17]\nIt is likewise important to note that it was PO2 Bautista himself who brought the request [18] for laboratory examination of the substance taken from appellants from the San Pedro Police Station to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Calamba City, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the confiscated items are preserved. Thus, the fact that the apprehending team did not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render appellants\u2019 arrest illegal or the items seized from them inadmissible in evidence.\n\nAs held by this Court in the case of People v. Llanita: [19]\n\nRA 9165 and its subsequent Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require strict compliance as to the chain of custody rule. x x x. We have emphasized that what is essential is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d\n\nBriefly stated, non-compliance with the procedural requirements under RA 9165 and its IRR relative to the custody, photographing, and drug-testing of the apprehended persons, is not a serious flaw that can render void the seizures and custody of drugs in a buy-bust operation.\n\nx x x x\n\nx x x. We recognize that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 may not always be possible under field conditions; the police operates under varied conditions, and cannot at all times attend to all the niceties of the procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence.\nFinally, both the trial court and the CA rejected appellants\u2019 defense of denial and frame-up for failure to substantiate the same.\n\nIndeed, the defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.\u00a0 In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence.\u00a0 In the case before us, appellants failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their claims. Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations. [20] Consequently, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive, this Court will not appreciate the defense of denial or frame-up and instead apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents.

No. P-14-3253, August 19, 2015 ]\n\nNICETAS TANIEZA-CALAYOAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ELMER JERRY C. CALAYOAN, PROCESS SERVER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 2, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nNICETAS TANIEZA-CALAYOAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ELMER JERRY C. CALAYOAN, PROCESS SERVER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 2, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\nBefore the Court is an administrative complaint for Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct filed by Nicetas Tanieza-Calayoan (Nicetas) against her husband, Elmer Jerry C. Calayoan (Elmer Jerry), a Process Server of Branch 2, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Bangued, Abra.\n\nThe Antecedent Facts\nNicetas and Elmer Jerry were married on 18 March 1993 and they subsequently had two children, Michael Jessie T. Calayoan (Michael Jessie) and Jenny Ann T. Calayoan (Jenny Ann). In a sworn Letter-Complaint dated 15 August 2005, [1] Nicetas alleged that Elmer Jerry abandoned her and their children since 18 May 2005 and that he was having an illicit affair with Rina Balboa (Rina). Nicetas further alleged that on 5 August 2005, she and her daughter Jenny Ann saw Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal, where the latter admitted to Nicetas that she was then three months pregnant. [2]\n\nIn his Comment dated 18 January 2006, [3] Elmer Jerry denied that he had any illicit relations with Rina and maintained that Rina was simply a neighbor. Elmer Jerry insisted that the complaint filed by Nicetas was merely a result of her jealousy and suspicion. He further denied the allegation that he was seen with Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005 because on this date, a Friday, he was on duty at Branch 2, RTC, Bangued, Abra. To support his claim, Elmer Jerry submitted a certified photocopy of his Daily Time Record (DTR). [4] Elmer Jerry also denied the allegation that he has abandoned his wife and children. On the contrary, Elmer Jerry claimed that he was still living in their family home in Barangay Deet, Tayum, while his wife and children left him to live in Bangued. [5]\n\nOn 10 October 2005, a criminal complaint for Concubinage [6] was filed against Elmer Jerry and Rina in the Municipal Trial Court of Tayum-Pe\u00f1arrubia, Abra. This, however, was subsequently dismissed on a technicality as the criminal complaint was improperly filed. [7] No other criminal complaint for Concubinage was filed against Elmer Jerry and Rina. [8]\n\nIn a letter dated 7 February 2006, [9] Nicetas wrote to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), reiterating her allegation that (1) she and her daughter saw Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005; (2) when Elmer Jerry and Rina found out that Nicetas had filed an administrative complaint, they transferred to live in the family home of Rina's mother in Bagalay, Tayum, Abra; (3) when Elmer Jerry and Rina became aware of the criminal complaint for Concubinage that was filed against them, they moved back to the house of Rina in Turod, Tayum, Abra, where it was of common knowledge that they were cohabiting as husband and wife; (4) Rina gave birth to a baby girl on 21 January 2006; and (5) Elmer Jerry had had several other illicit relations, one of which was with Rosemarie Jacquias (Rosemarie), a nursing student of Abra Valley Colleges. In support of the allegation that Elmer Jerry had illicit relations with Rosemarie, Nicetas attached the Minutes of Meeting dated 15 June 2000 between the school officials of Abra Valley Colleges, and Rosemarie and her parents. [10] Nicetas also attached Rosemarie's promissory note wherein she promised to stop her \"illicit relationship with Jerry Calayoan.\" [11]\n\nIn his Comment dated 11 September 2006, [12] Elmer Jerry again insisted that his alleged illicit relationships with other women, including that with Rosemarie, were all imaginary and merely the suspicions of his wife Nicetas. As to the picture of Elmer Jerry and Rina, which Nicetas attached to her letter to the OCA, Elmer Jerry explained that it was a simple group picture taken when he was attending a wedding during which Rina was also present as a godmother for a baptism. Finally, as to the daughter of Rina, Elmer Jerry alleged that he had \"no knowledge sufficient to form a belief about this fact\" and that Nicetas was merely speculating that he sired the child.\n\nOn 17 July 2006, in accordance with the recommendation of the OCA dated 22 May 2006, [13] the Court referred the instant administrative matter to the Executive Judge of the RTC at Bucay, Abra for investigation, report and recommendation. [14]\n\nThen Acting Presiding Judge Charito B. Gonzales (Judge Gonzales) initially presided over the investigation of this matter. Thereafter, upon appointment of Judge Elpidio C. Cablayan (Judge Cablayan) to Branch 58, RTC, Bucay, Judge Gonzales turned over this administrative matter to Judge Cablayan. Judge Cablayan, however, retired from the service without completing the investigation. Thus, in a Resolution dated 20 August 2008, the Court referred this case to Acting Presiding Judge Gabino B. Balbin, Jr. (Judge Balbin) for investigation, report and recommendation within sixty (60) days from notice thereof. This period lapsed without any report from Judge Balbin. In an Order dated 27 August 2010, Judge Balbin \"relieved himself of any responsibility in trying and deciding\" the case as Judge Jaime L. Dojillo, Jr. (Judge Dojillo) was appointed as the new presiding judge of Branch 58, RTC, Bucay. Judge Dojillo immediately set the case for presentation of evidence. Thereafter, Judge Dojillo began to hear the testimonies of the parties.\n\nHowever, in a Resolution dated 28 February 2011, the Court directed Judge Balbin to continue with the investigation of the case and to decide the same with dispatch. On 23 March 2011, Judge Balbin filed a Motion to be Relieved as Investigating Judge. Pending resolution of this motion, Judge Balbin heard the testimonies of the parties, continuing from where Judge Dojillo left off. Judge Balbin was able to conclude the investigation and thereafter, he submitted his Findings and Recommendation to the Court. His Motion to be Relieved as Investigating Judge, which had become moot and academic, was subsequently denied.\n\nReport of Investigating Judge\n\nJudge Balbin submitted his Findings and Recommendation dated 10 November 2011, [15] recommending that Elmer Jerry be suspended for one (1) year without pay. While Judge Balbin found the DTR of Elmer Jerry a reasonable defense against the alleged sighting of Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005, he gave much credence to the testimony of Michael Jessie in finding that Elmer Jerry and Rina were indeed maintaining an illicit relationship, and thus guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct:\n\nHowever, the testimony of Michael Jessie Calayoan, the son of the complainant and the respondent, is too revealing to be ignored. He testified that on several occasions, his father, Jerry Calayoan, brought him and his sibling, Jenny Ann, to a house in Bagalay, Tayum, Abra where they ate lunch with Rina Balboa. Jerry Calayoan, Rina Balboa and their daughter, Elagerryn, are the occupants of the bungalow. Jerry Calayoan told them that Rina Balboa is his wife and that, Elagerryn, is their daughter . All of these gave him the impression that they are living together as a family. [16] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nJudge Balbin also took note of the name of the daughter of Rina, Elagerryn, which seemed to be derived from the names of Elmer Jerry and Rina:\n\nFurther, the birth certificate of Rina Balboa's child shows that the father's name was recorded as \"unknown\". There is no need to register name [sic] of the biological father. His name and Rina Balboa's name are all over the child's first name, which is a common practice among Filipino couples. The child's first name is \"ELAGERRYN\". \"ELAGERRYN\" was coined from the respondent's fist name \"ELMER JERRY\", while \"xxxRYN\" was added thereto after \"RINA\", Rina Balboa's first name. That the respondent and Rina Balboa flaunted their illicit relationship by naming their child after them, even after a criminal complaint was filed against them, is the height of insensitivity, for which reason the maximum penalty for the offense should be imposed. [17]\n\nThe Recommendation of the OCA\nThe OCA considered the findings of the Investigating Judge well-taken. In a Memorandum dated 3 March 2014, the OCA also relied heavily on the testimony of Michael Jessie in finding truth in Elmer Jerry and Rina's illicit relationship:\n\nxxx Indeed the testimony of Michael Jessie is compelling enough to hold respondent administratively liable for the offense charged. Michael Jessie personally witnessed respondent and Rina living together as husband and wife when respondent himself brought Michael Jessie on several\u00a0 occasions to the house where he and Rina were cohabiting, along with their child. Michael Jessie may have harbored a grudge towards respondent, but the same may be considered justified. As correctly pointed out by Judge Balbin, such feeling of resentment is a common expression of children like Michael Jessie who have been abandoned by their father to live with another woman. Besides, there is no showing that Michael Jessie was unduly pressured by complainant or anyone to testify against respondent. Hence, his testimony is entitled to full faith and credence. [18]\nThe OCA also took note of Elmer Jerry's alleged past relationship with Rosemarie, which he never denied:\n\nIt bears stressing that this is not the first time that respondent has had an illicit relationship. On cross-examination, complainant testified that before Rina, respondent had an extra-marital relationship with Rosemarie, a nursing student, which respondent never denied. Pieces of evidence were presented during the investigation in support of this allegation like the \"Minutes of Meeting at the Abra Valley College on June 15, 2000\" and \"Promissory Note of Rosemarie,\" which were marked as Exhibits \"H\" and \"I\" for complainant. Both exhibits show that Rosemarie expressly admitted that she had an illicit relationship with respondent. Judge Balbin, however, declared that the promissory note was not admitted in evidence because it was not identified by its author or anybody who has personal knowledge of its execution. Nonetheless, respondent's failure to deny his alleged immoral dalliance with Rosemarie is a tacit admission that such relationship existed and renders inconsequential the exclusion of the promissory note as evidence. [19]\nThe OCA also agreed with the finding of Judge Balbin that the name of Rina's daughter, Elagerryn, reflected the illicit relationship between Elmer Jerry and Rina:\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Judge Balbin, respondent and Rina have flaunted their illicit relationship by naming their child after them by combining the first and last syllables of their respective first names even after a criminal complaint for concubinage was filed against them by complainant. Although the case was dismissed due to a technicality, there is enough reason to warrant respondent's suspension from the service for one (1) year. [20]\nBased on the foregoing, the OCA recommended that: (a) the matter be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter; and (b) Elmer Jerry be adjudged guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct and be suspended from the service without pay and other benefits for one (1) year.\n\nIn a Resolution dated 13 August 2014, the Court resolved to re-docket the matter as a regular administrative matter against Elmer Jerry.\n\nThe Issue\nThe sole issue in this case is whether Elmer Jerry is guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe Court finds the report of the OCA in order.\n\nEvery official and employee in the public service is expected to observe a good degree of morality if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the government in the enforcement of the law. [21] Elmer Jerry was expected to adhere to the standard of decency expected of employees in the public service - this is more so because he is an employee of the court. The image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the women and men who work in the judiciary, from the judge to the lowest of its personnel. [22]\n\nElmer Jerry's act of maintaining an illicit relationship with Rina, and previously with Rosemarie, is hardly the behavior expected of court employees. His actions fall under the definition of disgraceful and immoral conduct, provided in the Revised Rules on the Administrative Offense of Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct, to wit:\n\nSection 1. Definition of Disgraceful and Immoral conduct - Disgraceful and Immoral conduct refers to an act which violates the basic norm of decency, morality and decorum abhorred and condemned by the society. It refers to conduct which is willful, flagrant or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to the opinions of the good and respectable members of the community. [23]\nThis Court, on several occasions, has held that abandonment of one's wife and children, and cohabitation with a woman not his wife, constitutes disgraceful and immoral conduct which should be subject to proper disciplinary action. [24] As established by the evidence on record, Elmer Jerry and Rina were living together as husband and wife, and had a daughter whom they named after themselves. In fact, according to Michael Jessie, Elmer Jerry even introduced Elagerryn and Rina as his daughter and wife, respectively. [25]\n\nElmer Jerry abandoned his wife Nicetas and their two children when he started to live together with Rina and Elagerryn. Not only this, but it seems that he has also been remiss in his duty to provide financially for his children with Nicetas. [26] Elmer Jerry's illicit relations with Rina and his abandonment of his family are defmitely contrary to the acceptable norms of morality, especially since he is expected to maintain a certain degree of decency and morality. His conduct shows moral indifference to the opinion of the good and respectable members of the community. He should be held administratively liable for his disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nThe Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, [27] which govern the conduct of disciplinary and non-disciplinary proceedings in administrative cases, provide that disgraceful and immoral conduct is a grave offense for which the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year shall be imposed for the first offense and dismissal for the second. [28]\n\nWhile this may be Elmer Jerry's first offense, his alleged previous relationship with Rosemarie - which seemed to have ceased in accordance with the promissory note issued by the latter, should nonetheless be taken into consideration in imposing the proper penalty. His conduct is serious enough to warrant the maximum penalty for his offense. The recommended penalty of suspension for one (1) year is in order.\n\nWHEREFORE , we find respondent Elmer Jerry C. Calayoan, Process Server, Regional Trial Court, Branch 2, Bangued, Abra, GUILTY of disgraceful and immoral conduct and SUSPEND him for one (1) year from the service without pay and other benefits with a STERN WARNING that a commission of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nBrion, Del Castillo, Mendoza, and Leonen, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Exhibit \"A,\" rollo , p. 5.\n\n[2] Exhibit \"N,\" id. at 65.\n\n[3] Id. at 47.\n\n[4] Exhibit \"E-l,\" id. at 15.\n\n[5] Id. at 56.\n\n[6] Id. at 18.\n\n[7] Id. at 200.\n\n[8] Id.\n\n[9] Exhibit \"G,\" id. at 20.\n\n[10] Exhibit\"H,\"id. at 21.\n\n[11] Exhibit\"I,\" id. at 22.\n\n[12] Id. at 45-46.\n\n[13] Id. at 33-34.\n\n[14] Id. at 36.\n\n[15] Id. at 276-283.\n\n[16] Id. at 281.\n\n[17] Id. at 282.\n\n[18] Id. at 290.\n\n[19] Id.\n\n[20] Id.\n\n[21] Babante-Capales v.

ANISHA* MAGAYOONG-MACABATO WITH HER SPOUSE DATU KHALIQUZZAMAN MACABATO, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF CATAMANAN MAMA, REPRESENTED BY HASAN MAMA, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseG.R. No. 208586 is a petition for review[1] assailing the Decision[2] promulgated on 25 September 2012 as well as the Resolution[3] promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated 25 March 2009[4] of Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur (RTC) in Civil Case No. 1073-93.In its 25 March 2009 Decision, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of petitioners Heirs of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong (petitioners) and against respondents Heirs of Catamanan Mama (respondents). The RTC quieted petitioners' title over the land described in their complaint and ordered respondents to pay damages to petitioners.In its 25 September 2012 Decision, the CA granted respondents' appeal and set aside the RTC's decision. The CA dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of cause of action.The FactsThe CA recited the facts as follows:The disputed piece of land at Lilod-Madaya, Marawi City is -A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast comer of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of Moslem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; x x x.Sometime in 1963, Datu Muslim Ayo executed a \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" of the disputed property in favor of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong for the price of P800.00. Some three years later, the corresponding Original Certificate of Title [OCT] No. P-189 dated 18 November 1966 was issued in the name of Mamalinding Magayoong.On 4 September 1985, Datu Mamalinding Magayoong died intestate. Before he died, though, he declared that the disputed property must be preserved and reserved for his daughters, petitioners-appellees Maimona and Anisah.On 5 September 1985, Baih Dinganoman Magayoong filed with the Regional Trial Court [RTC], Branch IX of Lanao del Sur a Petition for Perpetuation of Testimony of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong regarding the property.Petitioners-appellees Maimona Magayoong, married to Rasid Pangarungan, and Anisah Magayoong, married to Khaliquzaman Macabato occupied the property, where they both built their homes. Sometime in 1980, Maimona and her husband started a clinic in that lot, the Mamalinding Memorial Specialist Clinic.On 17 September 1993, respondents-appellants, the heirs of Catamanan Mama sent a letter demanding that petitioners vacate the property and to pay accrued rent. Attached to the letter was an Alias Writ of Execution dated 4 September 1979 in Civil Case No. 1953 for Partition of Real Property entitled Maroki Asar Ayo Munder versus Muslim Ayo.On 24 September 1993, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 1073-93 before Branch IX of the Regional Trial Court of Marawi City against the heirs of Catamanan Mama for Quieting of Title over the property.Petitioners aver that they are the actual possessors of the subject property since 1963. In fact, in 1981, they mortgaged it with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank for the sum of P10,000.00 to develop the medical clinic built on the property.In their Answer, respondents stated that the subject property was a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.] in the name of Muslim Ayo. They further stated that Mamalinding Magayoong purchased a residential property from Muslim Ayo which apparently was part of Lot 38 under Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. [T-]254 and registered in the name of Daria [sic] Adiong. Mamalinding Magayoong obtained title to the property under OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].A partition proceeding was instituted by Maroki Asar Ayo Munder before the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur, Branch 1 and docketed as Civil Case No. 1953. Lot 38 was partitioned between Muslim Ayo [Lot 38-A], Maroki Ayo [Lot 38-B], and Babai Asar Ayo [Lot 38-C]. The land in question is a portion of Lot 38-C. If at all, respondents aver, petitioners' possession of their portion of the property was by mere tolerance of their predecessors-in-interest.On 25 November 1993, there being no stipulation of facts and no request for admissions, the trial court issued an order declaring the pre-trial terminated.On 28 February 1994, in view of respondents' admission of the material facts in their answer, petitioners moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court rendered its 14 November 1994 decision granting petitioners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and upholding petitioners' position. Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated 20 March 1995. Unperturbed, respondents filed their notice of appeal from the trial court's decision.On 29 December 1999, the Court of Appeals, Manila rendered its decision, to wit:WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and this case is REMANDED to the lower court for reception of the evidence of the parties.SO ORDERED.Hence, trial ensued in the lower court. After the parties submitted their memoranda, the case was submitted for decision.[5]The RTC's RulingThe RTC issued the assailed decision dated 25 March 2009 and ruled in favor of petitioners. The RTC ruled that the evidence proved that petitioners are the owners of the subject land. The RTC stated:As copiously borne by the records, petitioners have preponderantly, if not overwhelmingly, shown that they are the absolute, lawful and true owner [sic] of the parcel of land described in their petition with an area of Five Hundred Ten (510) square meters and covered by OCT No. P-189 (Exhibits \"C,\" \"C-1\" and \"C-2\") issued by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City in the name of the late Mamalinding F. Magayoong in 1966. Said property was acquired by the late Mamalinding Magayoong by purchase from its former owner, Muslim Ayo, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of a Residential Lot (Exhibits \"A\" and \"A-1\" to \"A-9\") which described with particularity its technical descriptions and boundaries, with its exact location and portion being clearly underscored and delineated in the sketch plan (Exhibit \"A-9\") drawn and/or found at the dorsal side of said deed of sale.[6]The RTC further considered that the following facts and circumstances, taken together, prove that petitioners' predecessor-in-interest had exercised right of ownership over the subject property.\"[I]n 1963, he immediately took possession thereof and occupied it openly, publicly, adversely and uninterruptedly by having it fenced with hollow blocks and had constructed a house thereon which has long been used up to the present to house the Mamalinding Specialists' Clinic established by him for his daughters Dra. Maimona Magayoong-Pangarungan and Dra. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato. He had it declared for taxation purposes as shown by the Tax Declarations marked as Exhibits \"D\", \"D-1\", \"D-2\" and \"D-3\"; and thereafter, he paid the corresponding realty taxes thereon as shown not only by the Official Receipts marked as Exhibits \"E,\" \"E-1,\" \"E-2,\" \"E-3,\" \"E-4,\" \"E-5,\" \"E-6,\" \"E-7,\" \"E-8,\" \"E-9,\" and \"E-10,\" but also by the Tax Clearance marked as Exhibit \"F.\" Moreover, he had it, at one time, mortgaged with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank as a security for a P10,000.00 loan he obtained from said bank sometime in 1981 or 1982. As further indicia of possession and ownership over the property in question, the late Mamalinding Magayoong and Denganuman Magayoong (petitioners' parents and predecessors-in-interest) were even interred on the same parcel of land. Above all, their possession of said property was never disturbed for more than thirty (30) years by anybody, much less the respondents. All these facts and circumstances, taken together, deafeningly and eloquently speak of the stark truth that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest were the true and legitimate owners of the parcel of land in question.[7]The RTC pointed out that the land referred to as covered by TCT No. T-254 in the deed of sale is not the same land referred to as TCT No. T-254 registered in the name of Diaria Adiong.Respondents' protestation, however, cannot be taken hook, line, and sinker so to speak. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-254 (Exhibit \"2\") clearly shows on it [sic] face that it was issued only on October 12, 1967, or almost four (4) years after the aforesaid deed of sale (Exhibits \"A\" and \"3\") was executed on November 19, 1963, and it covers a parcel of land located at the Dansalan Townsite with an area of Three Hundred Eighteen (318) square meters. Clearly and undoubtedly, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 by and between Muslim Ayo and the late Mamalinding Magayoong, TCT No. T-254 was not yet existing as it was not yet issued. Besides, the area of the land as reflected in TCT No. T-254 is only 318 square meters, whereas the area of the land sold under the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 was 510 square meters. Thus, no other logical conclusion can be drawn from the aforesaid discrepancies than the fact that Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong did not have in mind TCT No. T-254 at the time they executed the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963.[8]The RTC considered respondents' attempt to cast doubt on the propriety of the deed of sale as an indirect attack on OCT No. P-189 issued to petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Mamalinding Magayoong, by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City on 18 November 1966.The RTC also dismissed respondents' presentation of an Alias Writ of Execution of a decision for the partition of Lot No. 38 in Civil Case No. 1953. The decision was rendered on 2 June 1971, and the Alias Writ of Execution was dated 4 September 1979. Respondents, however, did not register the writ of execution with the Register of Deeds and did not annotate it on OCT No. P-189. Moreover, respondents never filed an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the date of registration of the deed of sale, or the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the subject property. The deed of sale was executed on 19 November 1963, and registered on 2 June 1964. OCT No. P-189 was issued to Mamalinding Magayoong on 18 November 1966.Finally, the RTC ruled that petitioners proved by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, as follows:1. Quieting petitioners' title over the parcel of land described in their petition dated September 22, 1993 and removing any cloud of doubt that may be cast upon it; and2. Ordering the respondents, particularly Hassan Mama, to pay petitioners the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, and P20,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.SO ORDERED.[9]Respondents filed their appellants' brief dated 25 November 2009 through the Public Attorney's Office.The CA's RulingThe CA granted respondents' appeal and reversed the RTC's 25 March 2009 Decision. The CA rejected the RTC's ruling that petitioners' complaint qualified as one for quieting of title.At the outset, it must be stated that had the lower court thoroughly considered the complaint filed, it would have had no other course of action under the law but to dismiss it. Petitioners went no further than to allege in their complaint before the trial court that they received a letter with an attached Writ of Execution from the respondents demanding that they vacate and surrender the property and to pay accrued rentals. The allegation is vague and unconvincing. The trial court could not be reasonably expected to supply the missing details in their complaint. The complaint failed to allege that an \"instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding\" beclouded the petitioners' title over the property involved.They then proceeded to claim that the writ of execution could not be enforced as they were not made a party to the case and prayed, aside from removing clouds on their title, for damages and litigation costs. Hence, through their allegations, what petitioners imagined as clouds cast on their title to the property were respondents' alleged act of ejecting them from their purported property. Clearly, the acts alleged may be considered grounds for a petition for certiorari but definitely not one for quieting of title.[10]The CA ruled that petitioners do not have the requisite title to avail themselves of the remedy of quieting of title. Petitioners claim ownership of the subject property through the deed of sale between Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong and through OCT No. P-189 registered in Mamalinding Magayoong's name. The CA emphasized that the RTC ignored an irregularity in the transaction involving the subject property. The property described in the deed of sale was allegedly covered by a TCT No. T-254, but Mamalinding Magayoong, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, registered the property as OCT No. P-189. The CA also found a disparity between the boundaries of the land described in the deed of sale and the boundaries of the land described in OCT No. P-189.First, it must be remembered that petitioners staunchly claimed that their ownership to the disputed property can be traced to Mamalinding Magayoong who bought the property for P800.00 from Muslim Ayo as evidenced by the 19 November 1963 deed of sale. That instrument states that the subject land was a portion of Lot 38 and covered by TCT No. [T-]254. They allege private ownership, as evidenced by the deed of sale. It must also be emphasized that petitioners are asserting that subsequent to the sale, their predecessor was issued a title to the same property and this time covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic]. The records do not show, that it was ever an alienable land of the public domain. Clearly, the Original Transfer Certificate of Title [sic] must then be void because based on the deed of sale, Lot 38 is a private land covered by TCT No. [T-]254 which, therefore, can no longer be the subject of a free patent.Second, the description of the disputed property as found in the deed of sale does not coincide with the technical description of the land covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic], to wit:Deed of Sale:A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of M[o]slem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by TCT No. [T-]254; x x x.OCT No. P-185 [sic]:Beginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09E.; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.Containing an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE [503] SQUARE METERS.All points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.Bounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala [Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124]; on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak [Lot 51 Dansalan Cad...., along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Musl[e]m [Lot 38-B, Csd-9914].Bearings true.This lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.[11]The CA further stated that petitioners' payment of real property taxes on the subject land for more than 30 years does not prove ownership. The CA reiterated that petitioners are not holders of any legal or equitable title of the subject property, and they failed to meet this requisite for an action to quiet title. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision reads:FOR THE REASONS STATED, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del [Sur], Branch 09 dated 25 March 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new judgment will be entered in Civil Case No. 1073-93 dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action.[12]Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration[13] dated 22 October 2012. The CA denied the motion in a Resolution[14] dated 10 July 2013.The IssuesPetitioners enumerated the following grounds warranting allowance of their petition:With all due respect, it is humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has overlooked factors of substance and value which, if considered in their best lights, would affect the decision herein sought to be reconsidered.With all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners do not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.With all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners failed to establish the identity of the land sought to be quieted.With all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in not finding that herein petitioners are the absolute owners and possessors of the land in dispute.With all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in reversing and setting aside the decision dated March 25, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 09 in Civil Case No. 1073-93, and in dismissing said complaint.[15]The Court's RulingWe remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey to identify the metes and bounds of the subject property, which is referred to by petitioners as the lot covered by TCT No. T-254 and previously registered as OCT No. P-189, and by respondents as a portion of Lot No. 38-C, or \"a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\"Petitioners have been occupying a particular piece of land since 1963, or for more than half a century. However, the evidence submitted by petitioners does not clearly identify the land being claimed.The CA's finding of fact recites the technical description of the subject land. The deed of sale refers to the subject land as follows:A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai Mering, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and lot of Moslem Ayo (part of Lot No. 38) measuring 30 meters, more or less; or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less; assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; the sketch of the portion sold is further made at the back of this instrument and forming part and parcel of this deed[.][16]On the other hand, OCT No. P-189, covered by Free Patent No. 320224 and dated 18 November 1966, refers to the following land:Lot No. 38-C, Csd-9914Beginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21 E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20 W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09 E; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.Containing an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE (503) SQUARE METERS.All points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.Bounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala (Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124); on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak (Lot 51, Dansalan Cad. x x x), along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Muslem (Lot 38-B, Cad-9914).Bearings true.This lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.Note: Lot 38-C is identical to Lot 5005 Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, and is covered by FPA-VII-5-1211.[17]Conduct of a Relocation SurveyConsidering that the real property subject of the present action was never identified with certainty, we remand the present case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey by a team of surveyors to determine the identity of the land claimed by petitioners and respondents.Survey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and its boundaries and contents ascertained; also a map, plat or statement of the result of such survey, with the courses and distances and the quantity of the land. A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a reliable, if not accurate, verification survey. To settle the present dispute, the parties agreed to the conduct of a relocation survey. The Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines (MLSP) provides for the following rules in conducting relocation surveys:Section 593 \u2014 The relocation of corners or re-establishment of boundary lines shall be made using the bearings, distances and areas approved by the Director of Lands or written in the lease or Torrens title.Section 594 \u2014 The data used in monumenting or relocating corners of approved surveys shall be submitted to the Bureau of Lands for verification and approval. New corner marks set on the ground shall be accurately described in the field notes and indicated on the original plans on file in the Bureau of Lands.[18] (Italicization in the original)The team of surveyors shall be composed of a surveyor designated by the petitioners, a surveyor designated by the respondents, and a surveyor designated by the RTC. The survey shall be conducted in the presence of both parties and/or their authorized representatives. The cost of the survey shall be jointly shouldered by both parties.[19]WHEREFORE, the Decision promulgated on 25 September 2012 and the Resolution promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN are SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 9, for the conduct of a relocation survey to determine the property subject of this case, and thereafter to decide the case accordingly.SO ORDERED.Brion, Mendoza, and Leonen, JJ., concur.Del Castillo, J., on official leave.* Also referred to in some parts of the records as Dr. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato.[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.[2] Rollo, pp. 47-59.

HEIRS OF CATAMANAN MAMA, REPRESENTED BY HASAN MAMA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nG.R. No. 208586 is a petition for review [1] assailing the Decision [2] promulgated on 25 September 2012 as well as the Resolution [3] promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated 25 March 2009 [4] of Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur (RTC) in Civil Case No. 1073-93.\n\nIn its 25 March 2009 Decision, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of petitioners Heirs of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong (petitioners) and against respondents Heirs of Catamanan Mama (respondents). The RTC quieted petitioners' title over the land described in their complaint and ordered respondents to pay damages to petitioners.\n\nIn its 25 September 2012 Decision, the CA granted respondents' appeal and set aside the RTC's decision. The CA dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of cause of action.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe CA recited the facts as follows:\nThe disputed piece of land at Lilod-Madaya, Marawi City is -\n\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast comer of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of Moslem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; x x x.\nSometime in 1963, Datu Muslim Ayo executed a \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" of the disputed property in favor of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong for the price of P800.00. Some three years later, the corresponding Original Certificate of Title [OCT] No. P-189 dated 18 November 1966 was issued in the name of Mamalinding Magayoong.\n\nOn 4 September 1985, Datu Mamalinding Magayoong died intestate. Before he died, though, he declared that the disputed property must be preserved and reserved for his daughters, petitioners-appellees Maimona and Anisah.\n\nOn 5 September 1985, Baih Dinganoman Magayoong filed with the Regional Trial Court [RTC], Branch IX of Lanao del Sur a Petition for Perpetuation of Testimony of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong regarding the property.\n\nPetitioners-appellees Maimona Magayoong, married to Rasid Pangarungan, and Anisah Magayoong, married to Khaliquzaman Macabato occupied the property, where they both built their homes. Sometime in 1980, Maimona and her husband started a clinic in that lot, the Mamalinding Memorial Specialist Clinic.\n\nOn 17 September 1993, respondents-appellants, the heirs of Catamanan Mama sent a letter demanding that petitioners vacate the property and to pay accrued rent. Attached to the letter was an Alias Writ of Execution dated 4 September 1979 in Civil Case No. 1953 for Partition of Real Property entitled Maroki Asar Ayo Munder versus Muslim Ayo .\n\nOn 24 September 1993, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 1073-93 before Branch IX of the Regional Trial Court of Marawi City against the heirs of Catamanan Mama for Quieting of Title over the property.\n\nPetitioners aver that they are the actual possessors of the subject property since 1963. In fact, in 1981, they mortgaged it with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank for the sum of P10,000.00 to develop the medical clinic built on the property.\n\nIn their Answer, respondents stated that the subject property was a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.] in the name of Muslim Ayo. They further stated that Mamalinding Magayoong purchased a residential property from Muslim Ayo which apparently was part of Lot 38 under Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. [T-]254 and registered in the name of Daria [sic] Adiong. Mamalinding Magayoong obtained title to the property under OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\n\nA partition proceeding was instituted by Maroki Asar Ayo Munder before the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur, Branch 1 and docketed as Civil Case No. 1953. Lot 38 was partitioned between Muslim Ayo [Lot 38-A], Maroki Ayo [Lot 38-B], and Babai Asar Ayo [Lot 38-C]. The land in question is a portion of Lot 38-C. If at all, respondents aver, petitioners' possession of their portion of the property was by mere tolerance of their predecessors-in-interest.\n\nOn 25 November 1993, there being no stipulation of facts and no request for admissions, the trial court issued an order declaring the pre-trial terminated.\n\nOn 28 February 1994, in view of respondents' admission of the material facts in their answer, petitioners moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court rendered its 14 November 1994 decision granting petitioners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and upholding petitioners' position. Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated 20 March 1995. Unperturbed, respondents filed their notice of appeal from the trial court's decision.\n\nOn 29 December 1999, the Court of Appeals, Manila rendered its decision, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and this case is REMANDED to the lower court for reception of the evidence of the parties.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nHence, trial ensued in the lower court. After the parties submitted their memoranda, the case was submitted for decision. [5]\nThe RTC's Ruling\n\nThe RTC issued the assailed decision dated 25 March 2009 and ruled in favor of petitioners. The RTC ruled that the evidence proved that petitioners are the owners of the subject land. The RTC stated:\nAs copiously borne by the records, petitioners have preponderantly, if not overwhelmingly, shown that they are the absolute, lawful and true owner [sic] of the parcel of land described in their petition with an area of Five Hundred Ten (510) square meters and covered by OCT No. P-189 (Exhibits \"C,\" \"C-1\" and \"C-2\") issued by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City in the name of the late Mamalinding F. Magayoong in 1966. Said property was acquired by the late Mamalinding Magayoong by purchase from its former owner, Muslim Ayo, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of a Residential Lot (Exhibits \"A\" and \"A-1\" to \"A-9\") which described with particularity its technical descriptions and boundaries, with its exact location and portion being clearly underscored and delineated in the sketch plan (Exhibit \"A-9\") drawn and/or found at the dorsal side of said deed of sale. [6]\nThe RTC further considered that the following facts and circumstances, taken together, prove that petitioners' predecessor-in-interest had exercised right of ownership over the subject property.\n\"[I]n 1963, he immediately took possession thereof and occupied it openly, publicly, adversely and uninterruptedly by having it fenced with hollow blocks and had constructed a house thereon which has long been used up to the present to house the Mamalinding Specialists' Clinic established by him for his daughters Dra. Maimona Magayoong-Pangarungan and Dra. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato. He had it declared for taxation purposes as shown by the Tax Declarations marked as Exhibits \"D\", \"D-1\", \"D-2\" and \"D-3\"; and thereafter, he paid the corresponding realty taxes thereon as shown not only by the Official Receipts marked as Exhibits \"E,\" \"E-1,\" \"E-2,\" \"E-3,\" \"E-4,\" \"E-5,\" \"E-6,\" \"E-7,\" \"E-8,\" \"E-9,\" and \"E-10,\" but also by the Tax Clearance marked as Exhibit \"F.\" Moreover, he had it, at one time, mortgaged with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank as a security for a P10,000.00 loan he obtained from said bank sometime in 1981 or 1982. As further indicia of possession and ownership over the property in question, the late Mamalinding Magayoong and Denganuman Magayoong (petitioners' parents and predecessors-in-interest) were even interred on the same parcel of land. Above all, their possession of said property was never disturbed for more than thirty (30) years by anybody, much less the respondents. All these facts and circumstances, taken together, deafeningly and eloquently speak of the stark truth that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest were the true and legitimate owners of the parcel of land in question. [7]\nThe RTC pointed out that the land referred to as covered by TCT No. T-254 in the deed of sale is not the same land referred to as TCT No. T-254 registered in the name of Diaria Adiong.\nRespondents' protestation, however, cannot be taken hook, line, and sinker so to speak. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-254 (Exhibit \"2\") clearly shows on it [sic] face that it was issued only on October 12, 1967, or almost four (4) years after the aforesaid deed of sale (Exhibits \"A\" and \"3\") was executed on November 19, 1963, and it covers a parcel of land located at the Dansalan Townsite with an area of Three Hundred Eighteen (318) square meters. Clearly and undoubtedly, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 by and between Muslim Ayo and the late Mamalinding Magayoong, TCT No. T-254 was not yet existing as it was not yet issued. Besides, the area of the land as reflected in TCT No. T-254 is only 318 square meters, whereas the area of the land sold under the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 was 510 square meters. Thus, no other logical conclusion can be drawn from the aforesaid discrepancies than the fact that Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong did not have in mind TCT No. T-254 at the time they executed the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963. [8]\nThe RTC considered respondents' attempt to cast doubt on the propriety of the deed of sale as an indirect attack on OCT No. P-189 issued to petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Mamalinding Magayoong, by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City on 18 November 1966.\n\nThe RTC also dismissed respondents' presentation of an Alias Writ of Execution of a decision for the partition of Lot No. 38 in Civil Case No. 1953. The decision was rendered on 2 June 1971, and the Alias Writ of Execution was dated 4 September 1979. Respondents, however, did not register the writ of execution with the Register of Deeds and did not annotate it on OCT No. P-189. Moreover, respondents never filed an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the date of registration of the deed of sale, or the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the subject property. The deed of sale was executed on 19 November 1963, and registered on 2 June 1964. OCT No. P-189 was issued to Mamalinding Magayoong on 18 November 1966.\n\nFinally, the RTC ruled that petitioners proved by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, as follows:\n\n1. Quieting petitioners' title over the parcel of land described in their petition dated September 22, 1993 and removing any cloud of doubt that may be cast upon it; and\n\n2. Ordering the respondents, particularly Hassan Mama, to pay petitioners the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, and P20,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.\n\nSO ORDERED. [9]\nRespondents filed their appellants' brief dated 25 November 2009 through the Public Attorney's Office.\n\nThe CA's Ruling\n\nThe CA granted respondents' appeal and reversed the RTC's 25 March 2009 Decision. The CA rejected the RTC's ruling that petitioners' complaint qualified as one for quieting of title.\nAt the outset, it must be stated that had the lower court thoroughly considered the complaint filed, it would have had no other course of action under the law but to dismiss it. Petitioners went no further than to allege in their complaint before the trial court that they received a letter with an attached Writ of Execution from the respondents demanding that they vacate and surrender the property and to pay accrued rentals. The allegation is vague and unconvincing. The trial court could not be reasonably expected to supply the missing details in their complaint. The complaint failed to allege that an \"instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding\" beclouded the petitioners' title over the property involved.\n\nThey then proceeded to claim that the writ of execution could not be enforced as they were not made a party to the case and prayed, aside from removing clouds on their title, for damages and litigation costs. Hence, through their allegations, what petitioners imagined as clouds cast on their title to the property were respondents' alleged act of ejecting them from their purported property. Clearly, the acts alleged may be considered grounds for a petition for certiorari but definitely not one for quieting of title. [10]\nThe CA ruled that petitioners do not have the requisite title to avail themselves of the remedy of quieting of title. Petitioners claim ownership of the subject property through the deed of sale between Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong and through OCT No. P-189 registered in Mamalinding Magayoong's name. The CA emphasized that the RTC ignored an irregularity in the transaction involving the subject property. The property described in the deed of sale was allegedly covered by a TCT No. T-254, but Mamalinding Magayoong, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, registered the property as OCT No. P-189. The CA also found a disparity between the boundaries of the land described in the deed of sale and the boundaries of the land described in OCT No. P-189.\nFirst, it must be remembered that petitioners staunchly claimed that their ownership to the disputed property can be traced to Mamalinding Magayoong who bought the property for P800.00 from Muslim Ayo as evidenced by the 19 November 1963 deed of sale. That instrument states that the subject land was a portion of Lot 38 and covered by TCT No. [T-]254. They allege private ownership, as evidenced by the deed of sale. It must also be emphasized that petitioners are asserting that subsequent to the sale, their predecessor was issued a title to the same property and this time covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic]. The records do not show, that it was ever an alienable land of the public domain. Clearly, the Original Transfer Certificate of Title [sic] must then be void because based on the deed of sale, Lot 38 is a private land covered by TCT No. [T-]254 which, therefore, can no longer be the subject of a free patent.\n\nSecond, the description of the disputed property as found in the deed of sale does not coincide with the technical description of the land covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic], to wit:\nDeed of Sale:\n\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of M[o]slem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by TCT No. [T-]254; x x x.\n\nOCT No. P-185 [sic]:\n\nBeginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09E.; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.\n\nContaining an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE [503] SQUARE METERS.\n\nAll points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.\n\nBounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala [Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124]; on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak [Lot 51 Dansalan Cad...., along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Musl[e]m [Lot 38-B, Csd-9914].\n\nBearings true.\n\nThis lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966. [11]\nThe CA further stated that petitioners' payment of real property taxes on the subject land for more than 30 years does not prove ownership. The CA reiterated that petitioners are not holders of any legal or equitable title of the subject property, and they failed to meet this requisite for an action to quiet title. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision reads:\nFOR THE REASONS STATED, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del [Sur], Branch 09 dated 25 March 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new judgment will be entered in Civil Case No. 1073-93 dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action. [12]\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration [13] dated 22 October 2012. The CA denied the motion in a Resolution [14] dated 10 July 2013.\n\nThe Issues\n\nPetitioners enumerated the following grounds warranting allowance of their petition:\nWith all due respect, it is humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has overlooked factors of substance and value which, if considered in their best lights, would affect the decision herein sought to be reconsidered.\n\nWith all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners do not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.\n\nWith all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners failed to establish the identity of the land sought to be quieted.\n\nWith all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in not finding that herein petitioners are the absolute owners and possessors of the land in dispute.\n\nWith all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in reversing and setting aside the decision dated March 25, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 09 in Civil Case No. 1073-93, and in dismissing said complaint. [15]\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nWe remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey to identify the metes and bounds of the subject property, which is referred to by petitioners as the lot covered by TCT No. T-254 and previously registered as OCT No. P-189, and by respondents as a portion of Lot No. 38-C, or \"a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\"\n\nPetitioners have been occupying a particular piece of land since 1963, or for more than half a century. However, the evidence submitted by petitioners does not clearly identify the land being claimed.\n\nThe CA's finding of fact recites the technical description of the subject land. The deed of sale refers to the subject land as follows:\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai Mering, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and lot of Moslem Ayo (part of Lot No. 38) measuring 30 meters, more or less; or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less; assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; the sketch of the portion sold is further made at the back of this instrument and forming part and parcel of this deed[.] [16]\nOn the other hand, OCT No. P-189, covered by Free Patent No. 320224 and dated 18 November 1966, refers to the following land:\nLot No. 38-C, Csd-9914\n\nBeginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21 E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20 W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09 E; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.\n\nContaining an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE (503) SQUARE METERS.\n\nAll points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.\n\nBounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala (Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124); on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak (Lot 51, Dansalan Cad. x x x), along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Muslem (Lot 38-B, Cad-9914).\n\nBearings true.\n\nThis lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.\n\nNote: Lot 38-C is identical to Lot 5005 Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, and is covered by FPA-VII-5-1211. [17]\nConduct of a Relocation Survey\n\nConsidering that the real property subject of the present action was never identified with certainty, we remand the present case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey by a team of surveyors to determine the identity of the land claimed by petitioners and respondents.\nSurvey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and its boundaries and contents ascertained; also a map, plat or statement of the result of such survey, with the courses and distances and the quantity of the land. A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a reliable, if not accurate, verification survey. To settle the present dispute, the parties agreed to the conduct of a relocation survey. The Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines (MLSP) provides for the following rules in conducting relocation surveys:\n\nSection 593 \u2014 The relocation of corners or re-establishment of boundary lines shall be made using the bearings, distances and areas approved by the Director of Lands or written in the lease or Torrens title .\n\nSection 594 \u2014 The data used in monumenting or relocating corners of approved surveys shall be submitted to the Bureau of Lands for verification and approval . New corner marks set on the ground shall be accurately described in the field notes and indicated on the original plans on file in the Bureau of Lands. [18] (Italicization in the original)\nThe team of surveyors shall be composed of a surveyor designated by the petitioners, a surveyor designated by the respondents, and a surveyor designated by the RTC. The survey shall be conducted in the presence of both parties and/or their authorized representatives. The cost of the survey shall be jointly shouldered by both parties. [19]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision promulgated on 25 September 2012 and the Resolution promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN are SET ASIDE . The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 9, for the conduct of a relocation survey to determine the property subject of this case, and thereafter to decide the case accordingly.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nBrion, Mendoza , and Leonen, JJ. , concur.\nDel Castillo, J. , on official leave.\n\n* Also referred to in some parts of the records as Dr. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato.\n\n[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 47-59.

No. 9209, April 18, 2017 ]\n\nNENITA DE GUZMAN FERGUSON, COMPLAINANT, ATTY. SALVADOR P. RAMOS, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nNENITA DE GUZMAN FERGUSON, COMPLAINANT, ATTY. SALVADOR P. RAMOS, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nBefore the Court is the Complaint-Affidavit, [1] filed by Nenita De Guzman Ferguson (complainant), seeking the disbarment of Atty. Salvador P. Ramos (Atty. Ramos) for falsification, violation of notarial law and engaging in private practice while employed in the government service.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nComplainant alleged that on November 25, 2007, she purchased a house and lot located in San Rafael, Bulacan, for the sum of P800,000.00; that without her knowledge, the seller obtained a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) mainly to transfer the title of the said property to her name; that the seller was unaware that the said CLOA was void ab initio as the subject land was not an agricultural land and there existed a 10-year prohibition to transfer the subject land; that in 2009; complainant instituted a petition for the cancellation of the CLOA before the DAR Office; that the\u00a0 defendants were represented by Atty. Ramos, who was the Chief Legal Officer of DAR-Provincial Office in Bulacan; that complainant withdrew the petition before the DAR and filed the case before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Malolos City (RTC); that upon receipt of the Answer, complainant found out that it was strikingly similar to the one filed by the defendants in the DAR, which was prepared by Atty. Ramos; that complainant discovered that the Deed of Sale [2] dated April 24, 2009, which became the basis of the transfer of title was fraudulently altered as it only covered the sale of the land, not the house and lot, and the price indicated was only P188,340.00, not the amount of P800,000.00 [3] that she actually paid; that her signature and that of her husband, Douglas Ferguson (Douglas), were forged; that Atty. Ramos notarized the deed of sale without their presence; and that complainant and her husband neither appeared, executed nor acknowledged any document before Atty. Ramos as they never met him in person.\n\nIn his Comment, [4] Atty. Ramos denied that he represented the defendants in the case before the DAR but he admitted that he notarized their Answer. With respect to the charge of falsification of the April 24, 2009 Deed of Sale and the notarization of the aforementioned deed, Atty. Ramos likewise denied any participation and countered that his signature as a notary public was forged. Atty. Ramos, nonetheless, admitted that he notarized the \"genuine\" Deed of Sale, [5] dated May 12, 2009, executed between vendor Alfredo Inosanto, and vendees complainant and her spouse, involving the Same property for the amount of P300,000.00. [6] Atty. Ramos surmised that whoever benefited from such dastardly act could be the culprit in the falsification of the document as the forged deed of sale which indicated a lesser purchase price was the one presented in the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan in order to evade payment of a higher capital gains tax.\n\nIn its Resolution, [7] dated February 29, 2012 the Court referred the complaint to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nThe case was then set by the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the IBP for mandatory conference. Thereafter, parties were required to submit their respective position papers.\n\nIn its Report and Recommendation, [8] dated November 21, 2014, the CBD found Atty. Ramos guilty of violating the law on notarial practice and recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year and, in case he held a commission as a notary public; that it be revoked and that he be disqualified to act as a notary public for a period of two (2) years to be counted after his suspension. The CBD stated that the defense of forgery, without any corroborative evidence, was not credible. As to the charge. that of engaging in a private practice while employed in the government service against Atty. Ramos, the CBD opined that it should be addressed to the Civil Service Commission for the determination of his appropriate administrative liability.\n\nIn its Notice of Resolution No. XXI-2015-458, [9] dated June 6, 2015, the IBP-Board of Governors adopted and approved with modification the report and recommendation of the CBD, as follows:\n\nRESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex \"A\", finding the recommendation to be fully supported by the evidence on record and applicable laws and Respondent's notarization of a document in the absence of the parties' in violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Thus, Respondent Atty. Salvador P. Ramos' notarial commission, if presently commissioned, is immediately REVOKED. Furthermore, he is DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a Notary Public for two (2) years and is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months.\n\nThe Court agrees with the findings of the IBP but differs on the imposed penalty.\n\nSection 1, Public Act No. 2103, otherwise known as the Notarial Law states:\n\nThe acknowledgment shall be before a notary public or an officer duly authorized by law of the country to take acknowledgements of instruments or documents in the place where the act is done. The notary public or the officer taking the acknowledgment shall certify that the person acknowledging the instrument or document is known to him and that he is the same person who executed it, acknowledged that the same is his free act and deed. The certificate shall be made under the official seal, if he is required by law to keep a seal, and if not, his certificate shall so state.\nThe importance of the affiant's personal appearance was further emphasized in Section 2 (b), Rule IV of the Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004 which specifically provides that:\n\nA person shall not perform a notarial act if the person involved as signatory to the instrument or document \u2013\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization; and\n | \n(2) | is not personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization; and (2) is not personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules.\nThe afore-quoted rules clearly mandate that a notary public, before notarizing a document, should require the presence of the very person who executed the same. Thus, he certifies that it was the same person who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the contents and truth of what were stated therein. [10] The presence of the parties to the deed is necessary to enable the notary public to verify the genuineness of the signature of the affiant. [11]\n\nIn the present case, Atty. Ramos denied having notarized the April 24, 2009 deed of sale and claimed that his signature was forged. He even alluded that the person who benefited from it could be the forger as the capital gains tax liability was reduced. He, nonetheless, admitted notarizing the \"genuine\" deed of sale, dated May 12, 2009.\n\nRegardless of who the culprit was and the motive of such forgery, Atty. Ramos cannot be exonerated from liability. A perusal of the record would reveal that Douglas, one of the parties in the deed of sale, was not in the Philippines on May 12, 2009, the day the \"genuine\" deed of sale was notarized. Complainant presented a copy of Douglas' passport indicating that he entered the Philippines only on May 26, 2001 and left on June 12, 2001. This substantially established that indeed Douglas could not have personally appeared before Atty. Ramos when he notarized the deed.\n\nMoreover, an examination of the April 24, 2009 and May 12, 2009 deeds of sale disclosed that both documents bore the same document number, page number and book number of the notarial registry of Atty. Ramos. If, indeed, the April 24, 2009 deed of sale, which was issued earlier was forged, how would the purported culprit know the detail of Atty. Ramos' notarial registry?\n\nIt must be emphasized that notarization is not an empty, meaningless and routinary act. It is imbued with public interest. and only those who are qualified and authorized may act as notaries public. [12] In the case of Gonzales v. Ramos, [13] the Court explained the significance of the act of notarization, thus:\n\nBy affixing his notarial seal on the instrument, the respondent converted the Deed of Absolute Sale, from a private document into a public document. Such act is no empty gesture. The principal function of a notary public is to authenticate documents. When a notary public certifies to the due execution and delivery of a document under his hand and seal, he gives the document the force of evidence. Indeed, one of the purposes of requiring documents to be acknowledged before a notary public, in addition to the solemnity which should surround the execution and delivery of documents, is to authorize such documents to be given without further proof of their execution and delivery. A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. Courts, administrative agencies and the public at large must be able to rely upon the acknowledgement executed before a notary public and appended to a private instrument. Hence, a notary public must discharge his powers and duties, which are impressed with public interest, with accuracy and fidelity.\n\nNot only did Atty. Ramos fail to comply with the Rule on Notarial Practice when he notarized the deed of sale without the presence of the parties but he likewise violated Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which obliges a lawyer to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for the law and legal processes; and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which proscribes a lawyer from engaging in any unlawful, dishonest, immoral and deceitful conduct. [14]\n\nAs a lawyer commissioned as notary public, Atty. Ramos was mandated to exercise the function of his office and must observe with utmost care the basic formalities of his office and requisites in the performance of his duties. [15] When Atty. Ramos affixed his signature and notarial seal on the deed of sale, he led us to believe that the parties personally appeared before him and attested to the truth and veracity of the contents thereof. His conduct was fraught with dangerous possibilities considering the conclusiveness on the due execution of a document that our courts and the public accord on notarized documents. [16] Certainly, Atty. Ramos failed to exercise the functions of the office and to comply with the mandates of the law.\n\nIn the case of Santuyo v. Atty. Hidalgo, [17] the respondent lawyer similarly denied having notarized the subject deed of sale. The Court found him negligent not only in the supposed notarization but in allowing the office secretaries to make the necessary entries in his notarial registry which was supposed to be done and kept by him alone. He was suspended from his commissioned as notary public and was disqualified from being commissioned as notary public for a period of two years.\n\nIn the case of Ocampo-Ingcoco v. Atty. Yrreverre, Jr., [18] the respondent lawyer was suspended from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months for notarizing a document without the appearance of the parties. The Court held that a notary public should not notarize a document unless the persons who signed it are the very same persons who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the truth of the contents therein.\n\nIn line with these cases, the Court finds the suspension of Atty. Ramos for six (6) months in order.\n\nWith respect to the allegation that Atty. Ramos was engaged in a private practice while employed in the government service, the Court agrees with the CBD that the issue should be brought before the Civil Service Commission for the determination of his appropriate administrative liability, if any.\n\nFinally, this Court cannot ignore the averments of Atty. Ramos that there were two (2) deeds of sale covering Transfer Certificate of Title No. CLOA-T-15831. One was the April 24, 2009 Deed of Sale which was presented to the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan, and the other one was the May 12, 2009 Deed of Sale which was kept on file at the Notarial Section of the RTC. Both deeds were registered in the Notarial Registry of Atty. Ramos with document number 354, page number 71 and Book VII series of 2009. Because of this irregularity, the Court deems it proper to refer this matter to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for the assessment of the correct tax and for investigation for possible prosecution of the criminal liability of the culprits under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nWHEREFORE, finding Atty. Salvador P. Ramos GUILTY of violating the Rule on Notarial Practice and Rule 1.01 and Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Court hereby SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for six (6) months; REVOKES his notarial commission, effective immediately; and PERMANENTLY BARS him from being commissioned as notary public, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar conduct will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet copies of this decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be attached to the personal record of Atty. Salvador P. Ramos; the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all lower courts; and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, for proper guidance and information.\n\nThe Civil Service Commission and the Bureau of Internal Revenue should likewise be given copies of this decision for their appropriate actions.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nSereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Del Castillo, Mendoza, Reyes, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Martires, and Tijam, JJ., concur.\n\nBersamin, J., no part.\n\nNOTICE OF JUDGMENT\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on April 18, 2017 a Decision /Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled administrative matters, the original of which was received by this Office on may 25, 2017 at 9:30 a.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

D E C I S I O N REYES, JR., J: This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated November 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 115796, dismissing the Petition for Review entitled \"Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union (PGIEU) vs. Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc.'' as well as the Resolution[3] dated May 17, 2013 denying Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union's (petitioner) Motion[4] for Reconsideration dated November 27, 2012. The Facts Petitioner is a legitimate labor organization and the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc. (respondent).[5] On July 31, 2008, the petitioner and respondent formally executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was made effective for the period from November 1, 2007 until October 31, 2012. Under Article VII, Section 1 thereof, there is a stipulation governing salary increases of the respondent's rank-and-file employees, as follows: Section 1. WAGE INCREASE The COMPANY will grant the following: - Effective Nov. 1, 2007, P260,000.00 - lump sum payment for the 1st year of this agreement (taxable). - Effective Nov. 1, 2008, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00. - Effective Nov. 1, 2009, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00.[6] In implementing the foregoing provision, the parties agreed on the following guidelines appended as Annex D of said CBA, viz.: Employment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / / Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X / On October 6, 2009, a letter dated September 20, 2009 was sent by the petitioner's President to respondent expressing, on behalf of its members, the concern that the aforesaid CBA provision and implementing rules were not being implemented properly pursuant to the guidelines and that, if not addressed, might result to a salary distortion among union members.[7] On even date, respondent responded by letter denying any occurrence of salary distortion among union members and reiterating its remuneration philosophy of having \"similar values for similar jobs\", which means that employees in similarly-valued jobs would have similar salary rates. It explained that to attain such objective, it made annual reviews and necessary adjustments of the employees' salaries and hiring rates based on the computed values for each job.[8] Finding the explanation not satisfactory, petitioner, with respondent's approval, referred the subject dispute to the Voluntary Arbitration of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). It averred that respondent breached their CBA provision on worker's wage increase because it granted salary increase even to probationary employees in contravention of the express mandate of that particular CBA article and implementing guidelines that salary increases were to be given only to regular employees.[9] To cite an example, petitioner alleged that respondent granted salary increases of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) each to then probationary employees Sherwin Lanao (Lanao) and Jonel Cordovales (Cordovales) at a time when they have not yet attained regular status. They (Lanao and Cordovales) were regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, yet they were given salary increase for November 1, 2008. As a consequence of their accelerated increases, wages of said probationary workers equated the wage rates of the regular employees, thereby obliterating the wage rates distinction based on merit, skills and length of service. Therefore, the petitioner insisted that its members' salaries must necessarily be increased so as to maintain the higher strata of their salaries from those of the probationary employees who were given the said premature salary increases.[10] On the other hand, respondent maintained that it did not commit any violation of that CBA provision and its implementing guidelines; in fact, it complied therewith. It reasoned that the questioned increases given to Lanao and Cordovales' salaries were granted, not during their probationary employment, but after they were already regularized. It further asseverated that there was actually no salary distortion in this case since the disparity or difference of salaries between Lanao and Cordovales with that of the other company employees were merely a result of their being hired on different dates, regularization at different occasions, and differences in their hiring rates at the time of their employment.[11] After due proceedings, the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a Decision[12] dated August 16, 2010 in favor of respondent, ruling that petitioner failed to duly substantiate its allegations that the former prematurely gave salary increases to its probationary employees and that there was a resultant distortion in the salary scale of its regular employees.[13] Thereafter, a Petition[14] for Review under Rule 65 was filed with the CA on September 22, 2010. On November 5, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision.[15] It dismissed the petition for review and sustained the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision. The pertinent and dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads as follows: In fine, We hold that the Voluntary Arbitrator of NCMB did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner union's complaint against respondent company. Settled is the rule that factual findings of labor officials who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality, and they are binding when supported by substantial evidence. In this case, these findings are supported by competent and convincing evidence. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED. The Decision dated 16 August 2010 of the Voluntary Arbitrator of the NCMB Regional Branch No. IV is SUSTAINED. SO ORDERED.[16] On November 28, 2012, petitioner filed its Motion[17] for Reconsideration. This was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution[18] dated May 17, 2013. Hence, this petition. The Issues I. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE CBA IN GRANTING WAGE INCREASE OF P1,500.00 TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD NOT YET ATTAINED REGULAR STATUS II. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GRANT OF WAGE INCREASE TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES IS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVES BY RESPONDENT III. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA ERRED IN NOT ORDERING RESPONDENT TO LIKEWISE INCREASE THE RATES OF OTHER REGULAR EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RATES AND THOSE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY GRANTED PREMATURE WAGE INCREASES Ruling of the Court The petition is devoid of merit. Petitioner and respondent entered into an agreement whereby employees will be granted a wage increase depending on the date of their regularization, viz.: Employment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / / Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X / Petitioner claims that Lanao and Cordovales having been regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, are not covered by the P260,000.00 lump sum and the initial P1500.00 wage increase effective on Nov. 1, 2008. It appears, however, that based on the actual pay slips of union members, Lanao and Cordovales both received wage increase in the amount of P1500.00 effective Nov. 1, 2008 and that such increase was immediately granted to them at the time of their hiring which resulted to the increase of their salaries to P36,500.00 per month. It is further stressed by petitioner that the increase granted by respondent to Lanao and Cordovales are violative of the terms of the CBA, specifically Section 1, Article VII and Annex D, for the reason that these employees have not yet attained \"Regular\" status at the time they were granted a wage increase and thus resulting to a salary/wage distortion. Respondent, for its part, claims that the alleged \"increase\" in the wages of these employees was not due to application of the provisions of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather it was brought about by the increase in the hiring rates at the time these employees were hired. As a matter of fact, a careful scrutiny of the records reveals that respondent have complied with the terms agreed upon in the CBA. Notably, respondent's reply to the petitioner's letter accusing them of violation of the terms of the CBA and holding them responsible for the alleged wage distortion, clarified the ambiguity with regard to the hiring rates, viz.: As for the perceived salary distortion among Union members resulting from the non-implementation of the guidelines on Article VH-Salaries and Allowances, Section 1 - Wage Increase, Annex D of the CBA 2007-2012, we would like to reiterate our discussion during the recent NLMC meeting of September 16, on Chevron's remuneration philosophy of having \"similar value for similar jobs\" which simply states that employees in similarly valued jobs will have similar salary rates. Salaries and hiring rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on the computed values of each job, an employee's tenure or seniority in his/her current position will not influence the value of the job.[19] (Underlining Ours) Clearly then, the increase in the salaries of Lanao and Cordovales was not pursuant to the wage increase agreed upon in CBA 2007-2012 rather it was the result of the increase in hiring rates at the time they were hired. To illustrate, in its Reply,[20] respondent discussed the difference in the hiring rates of employees Lanao and Robert Gawat, viz.: Mr. Robert Gawat was regularized on April 16, 2007 having been hired on October 16, 2007 while Mr. Lanao as shown in the Company's position paper was regularized on January 1, 2010, having been hired only on July 1, 2009. At the time of Mr. Gawat's hiring, the hiring rate for Pay Grade 12 was P31,800.00. On April 16, 2007, Mr. Gawat was given a CBA salary increase under the 2002-2007 CBA of P1,700.00 per month which increased his pay to P33,500.00 per month. He received another CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA on November 1, 2008, thus increasing his pay to P35,000.00. On November 1, 2009, he received another salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA which further increased his pay to P36,500.00 per month until the present. On the other hand, when Mr. Lanao was hired on July 9, 2009, the hiring rate at the time for employees falling under Pay Grade 12 was already P35,000.00, having been adjusted by the company in accordance with market and industry practice. On January 1, 2010, Mr. Lanao was regularized and as dictated by the CBA, he was given a CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 per month effective January 1, 2010 which increased his monthly pay at the present to P36,500.00.[21] (Emphasis and underlining Ours) As shown above, the respondent never violated the CBA and in fact, complied with it to the letter. Clearly, the petitioner only used the respondent's alleged violation of the CBA when its true gripe is related to the respondent's prerogative of setting the hiring rate of the employees over which the petitioner neither has the personality nor the privilege to meddle or interfere with.[22] The second and third issue, being interrelated, shall be discussed jointly. Upon the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act, amending among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term \"Wage Distortion\" was explicitly defined as \"a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rate between and among employee groups an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service or other logical bases of differentiation.\"[23] Contrary to petitioner's claim of alleged \"wage distortion\", Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines only cover wage adjustments and increases due to a prescribed law or wage order, viz.: Article 124. Standards/Criteria for Minimum Wage Fixing. x x x x Where the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law or Wage Order issued by any Regional Board results in distortions of the wage structure within an establishment, the employer and union shall negotiate to correct the distortions. Any dispute arising from the wage distortions shall be resolved through the grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreement and, if it remains unresolved, through voluntary arbitration.[24] (Emphasis Ours) Prubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company[25] laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1) an existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) a significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) the elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) the existence of the distortion in the same region of the country. The apparent increase in Lanao and Cordovales' salaries as compared to the other company workers who also have the same salary/pay grade with them should not be interpreted to mean that they were given a premature increase for November 1, 2008, thus resulting to a wage distortion. The alleged increase in their salaries was not a result of the erroneous application of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather, it was because when they were hired by respondent in 2009, when the hiring rates were relatively higher as compared to those of the previous years. Verily, the setting and implementation of such various engagement rates were purely an exercise of the respondent's business prerogative in order to attract or lure the best possible applicants in the market and which We will not interfere with, absent any showing that it was exercised in bad faith. Management prerogative gives an employer freedom to regulate according to their discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment including work assignment, working methods, the processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers.[26] This right is tempered only by these limitations: that it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employees.[27] Petitioner claims that the wages of other employees should also be increased in order to maintain the difference between their salaries and those of employees granted a \"premature\" wage increase. Such a situation may be remedied if it falls under the concept of a wage distortion as defined by Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines. However, as already discussed, there is no wage distortion in the case at bench. Not all increases in salary which obliterate the salary differences of certain employees should be perceived as wage distortion. In the case of Bankard Employees Union-Workers Alliance Trade Unions v. National Labor Relations Commission,[28] the Court discussed the possible implication of an expanded interpretation of the concept of Wage Distortion, to wit: If the compulsory mandate under Article 124 to correct \"wage distortion\" is applied to voluntary and unilateral increases by the employer in fixing hiring rates which is inherently a business judgment prerogative, then the hands of the employer would be completely tied even in cases where an increase in wages of a particular group is justified due to a re-evaluation of the high productivity of a particular group, or as in the present case, the need to increase the competitiveness of Bankard's hiring rate. An employer would be discouraged from adjusting the salary rates of a particular group of employees for fear that it would result to a demand by all employees for a similar increase, especially if the financial conditions the business cannot address an across-the-board increase.[29] The Court's ruling in the case of Bankard seek to address and resolve conflicting opinions regarding the true concept of a wage distortion like the one presented in this case whereby a legitimate exercise by an employer of its management prerogative is being taken against it in the guise of an allegation that it is circumventing labor laws. An employer should not be held hostage by the whims and caprices of its employees especially when it has faithfully complied with and executed the terms of the CBA. It is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or agreements and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite.[30] On a final note, the Court has ruled time and again that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality by the courts when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the CA, in the exercise of its expanded jurisdiction to review findings of the National Labor Relations Commission. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 115796 is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.

[6]\n\nIn implementing the foregoing provision, the parties agreed on the following guidelines appended as Annex D of said CBA, viz .:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nEmployment Status | P260K | P1500 | P1500\n | Lump Sum | (Nov. 1, 2008) | (Nov. 1, 2009)\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2008 | / | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 | X | / | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 | X | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 | X | X | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 | X | X | /\n[END_TABLE]\n\nEmployment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / /\n/ Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X /\n\nOn October 6, 2009, a letter dated September 20, 2009 was sent by the petitioner's President to respondent expressing, on behalf of its members, the concern that the aforesaid CBA provision and implementing rules were not being implemented properly pursuant to the guidelines and that, if not addressed, might result to a salary distortion among union members. [7]\n\nOn even date, respondent responded by letter denying any occurrence of salary distortion among union members and reiterating its remuneration philosophy of having \"similar values for similar jobs\", which means that employees in similarly-valued jobs would have similar salary rates. It explained that to attain such objective, it made annual reviews and necessary adjustments of the employees' salaries and hiring rates based on the computed values for each job. [8]\n\nFinding the explanation not satisfactory, petitioner, with respondent's approval, referred the subject dispute to the Voluntary Arbitration of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). It averred that respondent breached their CBA provision on worker's wage increase because it granted salary increase even to probationary employees in contravention of the express mandate of that particular CBA article and implementing guidelines that salary increases were to be given only to regular employees. [9]\n\nTo cite an example, petitioner alleged that respondent granted salary increases of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) each to then probationary employees Sherwin Lanao (Lanao) and Jonel Cordovales (Cordovales) at a time when they have not yet attained regular status. They (Lanao and Cordovales) were regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, yet they were given salary increase for November 1, 2008. As a consequence of their accelerated increases, wages of said probationary workers equated the wage rates of the regular employees, thereby obliterating the wage rates distinction based on merit, skills and length of service. Therefore, the petitioner insisted that its members' salaries must necessarily be increased so as to maintain the higher strata of their salaries from those of the probationary employees who were given the said premature salary increases. [10]\n\nOn the other hand, respondent maintained that it did not commit any violation of that CBA provision and its implementing guidelines; in fact, it complied therewith. It reasoned that the questioned increases given to Lanao and Cordovales' salaries were granted, not during their probationary employment, but after they were already regularized. It further asseverated that there was actually no salary distortion in this case since the disparity or difference of salaries between Lanao and Cordovales with that of the other company employees were merely a result of their being hired on different dates, regularization at different occasions, and differences in their hiring rates at the time of their employment. [11]\n\nAfter due proceedings, the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a Decision [12] dated August 16, 2010 in favor of respondent, ruling that petitioner failed to duly substantiate its allegations that the former prematurely gave salary increases to its probationary employees and that there was a resultant distortion in the salary scale of its regular employees. [13]\n\nThereafter, a Petition [14] for Review under Rule 65 was filed with the CA on September 22, 2010.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision. [15] It dismissed the petition for review and sustained the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision. The pertinent and dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads as follows:\n\nIn fine, We hold that the Voluntary Arbitrator of NCMB did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner union's complaint against respondent company. Settled is the rule that factual findings of labor officials who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality, and they are binding when supported by substantial evidence. In this case, these findings are supported by competent and convincing evidence.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED . The Decision dated 16 August 2010 of the Voluntary Arbitrator of the NCMB Regional Branch No. IV is SUSTAINED .\n\nSO ORDERED. [16]\n\nOn November 28, 2012, petitioner filed its Motion [17] for Reconsideration. This was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution [18] dated May 17, 2013.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nThe Issues\n\nI.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE CBA IN GRANTING WAGE INCREASE OF P1,500.00 TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD NOT YET ATTAINED REGULAR STATUS\n\nII.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GRANT OF WAGE INCREASE TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES IS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVES BY RESPONDENT\n\nIII.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA ERRED IN NOT ORDERING RESPONDENT TO LIKEWISE INCREASE THE RATES OF OTHER REGULAR EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RATES AND THOSE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY GRANTED PREMATURE WAGE INCREASES\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe petition is devoid of merit.\n\nPetitioner and respondent entered into an agreement whereby employees will be granted a wage increase depending on the date of their regularization, viz .:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nEmployment Status | P260K | P1500 | P1500\n | Lump Sum | (Nov. 1, 2008) | (Nov. 1, 2009)\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2008 | / | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 | X | / | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 | X | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 | X | X | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 | X | X | /\n[END_TABLE]\n\nEmployment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X /\n/\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 X /\n/\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X /\n\nPetitioner claims that Lanao and Cordovales having been regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, are not covered by the P260,000.00 lump sum and the initial P1500.00 wage increase effective on Nov. 1, 2008. It appears, however, that based on the actual pay slips of union members, Lanao and Cordovales both received wage increase in the amount of P1500.00 effective Nov. 1, 2008 and that such increase was immediately granted to them at the time of their hiring which resulted to the increase of their salaries to P36,500.00 per month.\n\nIt is further stressed by petitioner that the increase granted by respondent to Lanao and Cordovales are violative of the terms of the CBA, specifically Section 1, Article VII and Annex D, for the reason that these employees have not yet attained \"Regular\" status at the time they were granted a wage increase and thus resulting to a salary/wage distortion.\n\nRespondent, for its part, claims that the alleged \"increase\" in the wages of these employees was not due to application of the provisions of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather it was brought about by the increase in the hiring rates at the time these employees were hired. As a matter of fact, a careful scrutiny of the records reveals that respondent have complied with the terms agreed upon in the CBA.\n\nNotably, respondent's reply to the petitioner's letter accusing them of violation of the terms of the CBA and holding them responsible for the alleged wage distortion, clarified the ambiguity with regard to the hiring rates, viz .:\n\nAs for the perceived salary distortion among Union members resulting from the non-implementation of the guidelines on Article VH-Salaries and Allowances, Section 1 - Wage Increase, Annex D of the CBA 2007-2012, we would like to reiterate our discussion during the recent NLMC meeting of September 16, on Chevron's remuneration philosophy of having \"similar value for similar jobs\" which simply states that employees in similarly valued jobs will have similar salary rates. Salaries and hiring rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on the computed values of each job, an employee's tenure or seniority in his/her current position will not influence the value of the job. [19] (Underlining Ours)\n\nClearly then, the increase in the salaries of Lanao and Cordovales was not pursuant to the wage increase agreed upon in CBA 2007-2012 rather it was the result of the increase in hiring rates at the time they were hired.\n\nTo illustrate, in its Reply , [20] respondent discussed the difference in the hiring rates of employees Lanao and Robert Gawat, viz .:\n\nMr. Robert Gawat was regularized on April 16, 2007 having been hired on October 16, 2007 while Mr. Lanao as shown in the Company's position paper was regularized on January 1, 2010, having been hired only on July 1, 2009. At the time of Mr. Gawat's hiring, the hiring rate for Pay Grade 12 was P31,800.00 . On April 16, 2007, Mr. Gawat was given a CBA salary increase under the 2002-2007 CBA of P1,700.00 per month which increased his pay to P33,500.00 per month. He received another CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA on November 1, 2008, thus increasing his pay to P35,000.00. On November 1, 2009, he received another salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA which further increased his pay to P36,500.00 per month until the present.\n\nOn the other hand, when Mr. Lanao was hired on July 9, 2009, the hiring rate at the time for employees falling under Pay Grade 12 was already P35,000.00 , having been adjusted by the company in accordance with market and industry practice. On January 1, 2010, Mr. Lanao was regularized and as dictated by the CBA, he was given a CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 per month effective January 1, 2010 which increased his monthly pay at the present to P36,500.00. [21] (Emphasis and underlining Ours)\n\nAs shown above, the respondent never violated the CBA and in fact, complied with it to the letter. Clearly, the petitioner only used the respondent's alleged violation of the CBA when its true gripe is related to the respondent's prerogative of setting the hiring rate of the employees over which the petitioner neither has the personality nor the privilege to meddle or interfere with. [22]\n\nThe second and third issue, being interrelated, shall be discussed jointly.\n\nUpon the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act, amending among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term \" Wage Distortion\" was explicitly defined as \"a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rate between and among employee groups an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service or other logical bases of differentiation. \" [23]\n\nContrary to petitioner's claim of alleged \"wage distortion\", Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines only cover wage adjustments and increases due to a prescribed law or wage order , viz .:\n\nArticle 124. Standards/Criteria for Minimum Wage Fixing .\n\nx x x x\n\nWhere the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law or Wage Order issued by any Regional Board results in distortions of the wage structure within an establishment, the employer and union shall negotiate to correct the distortions. Any dispute arising from the wage distortions shall be resolved through the grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreement and, if it remains unresolved, through voluntary arbitration. [24] (Emphasis Ours)\n\nPrubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company [25] laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1) an existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) a significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) the elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) the existence of the distortion in the same region of the country.\n\nThe apparent increase in Lanao and Cordovales' salaries as compared to the other company workers who also have the same salary/pay grade with them should not be interpreted to mean that they were given a premature increase for November 1, 2008, thus resulting to a wage distortion. The alleged increase in their salaries was not a result of the erroneous application of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather, it was because when they were hired by respondent in 2009, when the hiring rates were relatively higher as compared to those of the previous years. Verily, the setting and implementation of such various engagement rates were purely an exercise of the respondent's business prerogative in order to attract or lure the best possible applicants in the market and which We will not interfere with, absent any showing that it was exercised in bad faith.\n\nManagement prerogative gives an employer freedom to regulate according to their discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment including work assignment, working methods, the processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers. [26] This right is tempered only by these limitations: that it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employees. [27]\n\nPetitioner claims that the wages of other employees should also be increased in order to maintain the difference between their salaries and those of employees granted a \"premature\" wage increase. Such a situation may be remedied if it falls under the concept of a wage distortion as defined by Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines. However, as already discussed, there is no wage distortion in the case at bench. Not all increases in salary which obliterate the salary differences of certain employees should be perceived as wage distortion.\n\nIn the case of Bankard Employees Union-Workers Alliance Trade Unions v. National Labor Relations Commission , [28] the Court discussed the possible implication of an expanded interpretation of the concept of Wage Distortion, to wit:\n\nIf the compulsory mandate under Article 124 to correct \"wage distortion\" is applied to voluntary and unilateral increases by the employer in fixing hiring rates which is inherently a business judgment prerogative, then the hands of the employer would be completely tied even in cases where an increase in wages of a particular group is justified due to a re-evaluation of the high productivity of a particular group, or as in the present case, the need to increase the competitiveness of Bankard's hiring rate. An employer would be discouraged from adjusting the salary rates of a particular group of employees for fear that it would result to a demand by all employees for a similar increase, especially if the financial conditions the business cannot address an across-the-board increase. [29]\n\nThe Court's ruling in the case of Bankard seek to address and resolve conflicting opinions regarding the true concept of a wage distortion like the one presented in this case whereby a legitimate exercise by an employer of its management prerogative is being taken against it in the guise of an allegation that it is circumventing labor laws. An employer should not be held hostage by the whims and caprices of its employees especially when it has faithfully complied with and executed the terms of the CBA.\n\nIt is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or agreements and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite. [30]\n\nOn a final note, the Court has ruled time and again that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality by the courts when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the CA, in the exercise of its expanded jurisdiction to review findings of the National Labor Relations Commission.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is DENIED .
